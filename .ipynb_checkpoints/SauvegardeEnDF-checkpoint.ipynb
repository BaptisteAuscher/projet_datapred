I visited to find out\", 'body': 'It wasn\\'t like Marlon Brando to go spilling his private beans to the world about the life he had spent his years protecting.\\n\\nBut about Tetiaroa -- the Tahitian atoll of his childhood yearnings, and the refuge of his adult life -- he did.\\n\\nWe were friends for the last years of his life, and one day in 1997, at his house on the crown of Mulholland Drive, he said to me something he\\'d never said before: Take notes. He\\'d tell me about his private atoll, Tetiaroa, and one far-off day, he wanted me to explain to all of you what the place meant to him, and what he wanted it to become after he died.\\n\\nHis hope, his plan, was for Tetiaroa to become an ecologically responsible tropical resort, but more vitally, a nature preserve, an open-air experimental science laboratory, a \"university of the sea,\" all to serve the place and the planet.\\n\\nNow, I know that \"eco-resort\" is a paradox. The smallest human act can take a toll on the planet. And the carbon footprint of the rich can be Sasquatch-sized. But Marlon was paradoxical himself, so why should his vision not be practicable and paradoxical, as well?\\n\\nAnd what do you know? I went to see it in action, and it\\'s working about as well as he could have hoped.\\n\\nIn the faraway loveliness of the South Pacific, the Brando, the high-end private resort that carries his name, is carrying out some useful, cutting-edge technology that Marlon envisioned so many years ago.\\n\\nApril 3 will be his 100th birthday; July 1 will be 20 years since he died. By the time we talked about Tetiaroa, he had not seen it for some time, but it was always on his mind. It was also in his mind as the place where he liked to say he felt most himself, which is to say, no one special:\\n\\n\"Just a visitor, like thousands of other people who had been, and lived, who were born and died on Tetiaroa. So I was part of the passing parade, just a jeering, japing clown with a one-way ticket to eternity, like the rest of them. Like the rest of us.\"\\n\\nMarlon grew up in Nebraska and Illinois, his restless spirit and relentless curiosity too big for flesh-biting winters and small-town constraints. In the military school that was meant to bring him to heel, he hunkered down in the library.\\n\\n\"I loved reading the National Geographic. It would take me far afield, to places I\\'d never been, never even heard of. ... The culture which fascinated me most, which seemed most attractive to me, was the Polynesian culture. ... Here was this lovely and timeless place before me, in the pages of a magazine, and I thought, \\'One day, I\\'m going to go there.\\'\"\\n\\nTwo decades later, he reached his dream destination. In 1961, he was in Tahiti to film \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" He was Fletcher Christian, an officer in His Majesty\\'s 18th century navy, gussied up in gold braid and buttons for the role, and he couldn\\'t have been more eager to shed the suit and the buttoned-up culture it stood for.\\n\\nThis was his boyhood reverie made real. Within a few years, Marlon had started a Tahitian family and managed to buy Tetiaroa, the wild and sacred atoll about 40 miles from the capital city of Papeete, made up of a dozen small islands -- motus -- encircling an opalescent lagoon.\\n\\nAnd now you can break out the thesaurus. Anyone who sees Tetiaroa labors for superlatives and synonyms: magical, enchanting, gorgeous, possessing every earthly and unearthly tone of blue, its wind and its water so mild and sweet that maybe this is what the womb felt like, and what heaven will.\\n\\n\"The first night after I\\'d bought it, I put my head on a coconut I\\'d worked into the sand and used for a pillow. It\\'s wonderful to sleep naked on the beach, because the wind comes over you and gives you caresses like you\\'ve never been caressed in your life. ... I very quickly realized that I didn\\'t own that island; the island owned me. ... Nothing that I thought or felt or hoped for or experienced or knew would have any more significance than the grains of sand that I was lying on, and it gave me deep comfort. Most people, certainly many people, would be frightened by that. ... I\\'m a person who loves the desert, loves the emptiness, and loves the sky, loves lying on the beach and looking at a hemisphere of stars ... \"\\n\\nWhat was his and his alone is now a destination for those who can afford it. Among its guest list past, the Obamas, Beyonc√© and, supposedly, the honeymooning Pippa Middleton, sister of the Princess of Wales. Britney Spears was there while I was, but the staff are so discreet that the only way I knew she was there was that she posted about it herself. To that end, the Brando asks guests to sign a gentlemanly notice that people come seeking \"complete privacy and freedom,\" and so we all commit to \"refrain from any encroachment\" on that, including taking any pictures or \"any photographic images of other guests outside your party.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s part of the onstage Brando resort. The backstage Brando is what mattered most to Marlon. Before he died, he collaborated with Richard Bailey, chief executive of the Pacific Beachcomber French Polynesia luxe resort company, to make it so. And after Marlon died, Tetiaroa\\'s ownership went to a trust to benefit his children. Bailey\\'s firm has a 99-year lease on two motus -- about 10% of the atoll\\'s land -- with the rest preserved from any construction.\\n\\nThe Brando opened in 2014, 10 years after Marlon died, and it took every one of those years to get it working with its odd-couple combo of tranquil, lavish resort, inventive and challenging green systems, and respect for Tetiaroa\\'s deep cultural and ecological rarity.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not just about green,\" Bailey told me. \"Anyone can do green; it\\'s just a question of will. The driving factor for us is remoteness and isolation.\"\\n\\nThat, and as much sustainability as possible. Food autonomy on such a property is out of reach. As Bailey pointed out, \"Even the ancient Tahitians traded between islands.\" But there are other kinds of sustainability, and they are apparent from the window of the small Air Tetiaroa plane.\\n\\nApproaching the landing strip, most passengers are oohing and aahing at the blue view and beckoning palms, and I\\'m looking at the solar panel array fringing the landing strip -- thousands of them, and a couple of big storage batteries for sundown energy. There are generators that use biofuels and diesel as needed, but solar is the big player in the Brando\\'s energy future.\\n\\nIn this part of the world, the biggest single energy appetite is for air conditioning. For most of French Polynesia, that means fossil fuels brought in at great cost from elsewhere. Not in Marlon\\'s vision.\\n\\nOur mutual friend Ed Begley Jr., the environmentalist and actor, told me recently that Marlon \" wanted [Tetiaroa] to be a very low impact in every way -- carbon footprint, protection of wildlife, everything. He wanted to spread the message of what was possible, what one could do on an island like his, or wherever we live, that it was possible. He just always loved that cutting-edge stuff.\"\\n\\nMarlon subscribed to science magazines and technical journals. He learned about Tetiaroa\\'s water tables and soil quality and flora and fauna. In the early days, he applied himself hands-on to Tetiaroa\\'s plumbing challenges. In his later years, any plumber called to the Mulholland Drive house would find himself being followed around by Marlon, who\\'d also peer underneath the sinks alongside him and ask about torque wrench brands and hose bib fits.\\n\\nHe once summoned Begley up to the house to work out the practicalities of keeping electric eels in the swimming pool to generate power. There were none. \"You\\'re not going to have enough current to light up a child\\'s lightbulb project at a science fair,\" he informed Marlon, who did not take such negation well.\\n\\nBut not all of Marlon\\'s brainstorms were so outr√©, and here is the Brando\\'s principal innovative success. Tetiaroa has the world\\'s largest SWAC system, a seawater air conditioning loop. It provides the air conditioning for almost everything but food storage, with negligible ocean impact.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works: A 400-meter pipe through the atoll\\'s reef follows the ocean floor, and the natural ocean pressure itself brings up the cold seawater, occasionally using supplemental pumps. After the \"heat exchange\" process -- a kind of \"bundling\" where the cold seawater chills pipes full of warmer freshwater -- the seawater is sent back into the ocean a degree or two warmer than it arrived.\\n\\nOnce the seawater reaches land, the pipes carrying it cozy up to parallel pipes carrying freshwater. Via contact with titanium plates, the freshwater also gets frosty, and that chilled water loop sends its cold energy into the atoll\\'s air conditioning system.\\n\\nI saw this in a small experimental form on Bora Bora in 2005 and now here it was, scaled up and doing the job. The technology is geographically limited; the recipe starts with a coast and deep, cold ocean water. A hospital in the Tahitian capital is now using it too. Tetiaroa\\'s SWAC cost about $12 million to create, and it\\'s breaking even this year, so it\\'s pretty much gravy hereafter.\\n\\nOn my first visit, in 2005, Tetiaroa was beyond wild. Years before, Marlon planned a self-sustaining community that never came to pass, in part because most of the amenities he did build -- bungalows, a bar -- were whipped away by a tropical storm.\\n\\nThe mosquitos, as I remember, were as vicious as the Luftwaffe. And that\\'s another Marlon mission accomplished. A breeding program has virtually eradicated mosquitos on Tetiaroa. The bloodsuckers carry devastating diseases and, let\\'s face it, tourists come looking for fun, not infection.\\n\\nSo, using research by the French Polynesian Institut Louis Malard√©, Tetiaroa breeds and releases millions of male mosquitos whose bacteria makes the female bloodsuckers effectively sterile. There\\'s a photo of a visiting Barack Obama releasing some of the male mosquitos.\\n\\nThe institute coordinates the mosquito disappearing act with the nonprofit Tetiaroa Society, another of Marlon\\'s dream operations. It recruits students from as far off as UC Berkeley and the University of Washington for the work of protecting habitat and wildlife. It\\'s pretty much rid the atoll of the rats that kill native ground-nesting birds and the rare green sea turtles that now thrive by the thousands in the Tetiaroa sanctuary. [The society also protects the turtles from human rats -- the poachers who historically raided the turtles\\' nesting grounds.]\\n\\nAll of this requires rigor and expense. Even before you board the plane for Tetiaroa, a bio-inspection point in Papeete intercepts any items that could endanger Tetiaroa\\'s native ecosystem. My scientist friend Frances had to hand over her pear; bananas, which can carry a contagious plant ailment, will not be found in the atoll\\'s fruit baskets.\\n\\nThe Brando offers its guests lagoon boat tours around the motus, led by savvy young biologists who are incidentally all in for the recreational life aquatic here too. Ours pointed out fluffy booby hatchlings in the low branches of trees on one motu, and showed us up close the massive coconut crabs whose kind is coming back from the vanishing point.\\n\\nThe best tour for me was the \"green tour,\" a backstage look into the environmental operations. It too is a kind of theater, but one that raises the curtain for guests on some of the Brando\\'s priorities. Two massive food bio-digesters reduce food waste to compost in 24 hours. The recycling center sorts 29 varieties of objects, and manages to recycle something like half of them, saving the cost and carbon footprint of sending them off-island. Glass is ground into sand to fill in off-the-path areas. Coffee grounds are dumped out of coffee pods and used for compost. Rainwater feeds the atoll\\'s toilets.\\n\\nIn each villa, the television\\'s home-screen video is about the responsibilities to Tetiaroa\\'s environment and culture, and each villa has bins for recyclables. You won\\'t see that at your Ritz Carltons.\\n\\nMy second visit, last fall, was altogether different from the first. Take it as a given that there is no such thing as a budget visit to the Brando. My three-night stay, with Frances, was a one-time gift to me as one of Marlon\\'s friends-and-family circle. The villa rates start at about $3,000 a night, depending on the season.\\n\\nAt any one time, the Brando usually has 70 to 90 visitors, and a rotating staff of about 200, along with energy workers, Tetiaroa Society researchers and specialists like the venerable beekeeper who tends the atoll\\'s 70 hives for their distinctly flavored honeys.\\n\\nGuest services are suitably thorough and unobtrusive. Still, for that kind of money, even Brando guests don\\'t always get what they want; the island\\'s needs often come first. Sergei Petrov, the duty manager while I was there, told me that some people will insist on steak, not fish, \"and that I can do.\" But no, they have no bananas, nor imported Norwegian water, nor Mylar balloons for a birthday; substitutes will be courteously suggested.\\n\\nMarlon lived well but not diamonds-and-Rolls-Royce fancy, and he\\'d be bemused by some of the flashier guests who take routine R&Rs here. I wonder how many would have passed his test. Marlon loved to test people. Be invited to his Tetiaroa and you would be watched by him, to see whether you too shared his nirvana at its isolation, or whether instead you soon got edgy and full of angst, so far from concrete and gasoline power.\\n\\n\"We can study one place like Tetiaroa in microcosm and use that model. ... Whatever else I do there, the isolation is something I wish to preserve, because more and more, the quality of \\'less and less\\' is at a premium in this life. ... One of the things I want to do is teach people the value system that\\'s innate in Polynesian culture ... the Tahitians, they just accept what is there.\"\\n\\nHe taught me a Tahitian word, fiu, a kind of hand-flip word meaning \"enough,\" or \"fed up.\"\\n\\nHe might have used it for what he thought of acting. By the end of his life he had not much use for his extraordinary film legacy, nor for the phenomenal praise he got for having changed the art. He dismissed it, cavalierly and even cruelly, as \"lying for a living.\"\\n\\nFiu.\\n\\nBut the legacy of Tetiaroa that he has added to its long and legendary story -- that, I think, would have made him proud.', 'source': {'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/994df63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4262x2397+0+1465/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fc1%2F178a9a424794b7378e8b6aa945a2%2Frs2529-brando-ig07-high-johan-drone-adventure.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 448625383, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Jetzt relativiert er seine Kritik am B√ºndnis.\\n\\nLondon/Washington, D.C. - Donald Trump hat mit der Nato nicht viel am Hut. W√§hrend seiner Amtszeit als US-Pr√§sident hat er gleich mehrfach offen mit einem Austritt der USA aus dem B√ºndnis gedroht. Sein ehemaliger Sicherheitsberater John Bolton verweist auch gerne auf eine Aussage, die Trump einst ihm gegen√ºber gemacht haben soll: \"Ich gebe einen Schei√ü auf die Nato.\"\\n\\nTrump ist zwar nicht mehr im Amt, befindet sich aber mitten im Wahlkampf. Und seine Rhetorik hat sich nicht ge√§ndert, im Gegenteil. Erst im Februar sorgte er mit einer Bemerkung zur Nato bei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung f√ºr Aufsehen in Europa. Er sagte, er w√ºrde Nato-Partnern, die ihren finanziellen Verpflichtungen nicht nachk√§men, keinen Schutz vor Russland gew√§hren. Und Russland w√ºrde er \"sogar dazu ermutigen, zu tun, was auch immer zur H√∂lle sie wollen\".\\n\\nIn einem Interview mit dem rechtsorientierten britischen Sender GB News hat Trump seine Aussage jedoch relativiert. Auf die Frage des Moderators und Brexit-Bef√ºrworters Nigel Farage, ob Amerika in der Nato bleiben w√ºrde, wenn die anderen Mitgliedstaaten \"fair spielten\", antwortete Trump: \"Ja, 100 Prozent.\"\\n\\nTrump betonte jedoch, dass die europ√§ischen L√§nder die amerikanische Unterst√ºtzung nicht ausnutzen d√ºrften. \"Die Vereinigten Staaten sollten ihren gerechten Anteil zahlen, nicht den aller anderen.\" Er wies darauf hin, dass die Nato f√ºr Europa wichtiger sei als f√ºr die USA, da ein \"ein sch√∂ner, gro√üer, herrlicher Ozean\" zwischen den USA und \"einigen Problemen\" in Europa liege.\\n\\nTrump bezeichnete seine Aussagen zur Nato zudem als Verhandlungstaktik. \"Was ich sage, ist eine Art zu verhandeln. Warum sollten wir diese L√§nder besch√ºtzen, die eine Menge Geld haben, w√§hrend die USA das meiste f√ºr die Nato bezahlen?\"\\n\\nTrump ist nicht der erste US-Pr√§sident, der den Europ√§ern zu geringe Verteidigungsausgaben vorwirft. Beim Nato-Gipfel 2014 setzte sich vor allem der damalige demokratische Pr√§sident Barack Obama f√ºr das Zwei-Prozent-Ziel ein. Nach Angaben der Nato werden in diesem Jahr wahrscheinlich etwa 20 der derzeit 31 Alliierten die sogenannte Nato-Quote erf√ºllen und mindestens zwei Prozent ihres Bruttoinlandsprodukts f√ºr Verteidigung ausgeben. Deutschland wird nach Angaben von Diplomaten in Br√ºssel mit rund 2,1 Prozent erstmals seit dem Ende des Kalten Krieges dabei sein.\\n\\nDie Verb√ºndeten sorgen sich im Falle eines Wahlsieges von Trump nicht nur um die Zukunft der Nato, sondern auch um die Unterst√ºtzung der USA f√ºr die Ukraine. Trump prahlt damit, den Krieg in der Ukraine am ersten Tag seiner Amtszeit beenden zu k√∂nnen. In dem Interview mit GB News betonte er, dass er in der Lage sei, mit dem russischen Pr√§sidenten Wladimir Putin zu verhandeln. \"Ich kam gro√üartig mit Putin zurecht\", sagte er.

His final report amounted to a total evisceration of the stolen election myth they promoted -- and still do to this day.\\n\\nIn an interview, McBroom said that voting for Trump in Michigan\\'s GOP primary last month \"wasn\\'t a hard decision\" and that although he considered the possibility of other candidates, they \"had zero chance\" and \"they weren\\'t going anywhere -- and a couple of them I didn\\'t like.\"\\n\\nFurthermore, McBroom, who said he didn\\'t have any discussions with the Trump campaign ahead of his endorsement, tried to explain why he and other Republicans who were critical in one way or another of Trump\\'s effort to overturn the 2020 election are now firmly back on board with his candidacy.\\n\\n\"Nothing brings people together like winning,\" McBroom said, adding: \"And we want to win. And we\\'re supporting our ticket.\"\\n\\nMcBroom, whose state Senate district spans much of the Upper Peninsula, is hardly alone in that line of thinking. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.; and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp are among a group of Republicans who spoke out against Trump either for his effort to overturn the election or for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol -- and drew Trump\\'s sustained ire -- who are now supporting his White House run.\\n\\nA number of former Trump administration officials and Cabinet heads, including most recently former Vice President Mike Pence, have declined to endorse him.\\n\\nMcBroom said comparing Trump\\'s record with President Joe Biden\\'s shows that only one of them \"clearly aligns\" with McBroom\\'s priorities on the economy and foreign policy and with regard to the general stability of the U.S.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t mean I didn\\'t wait to see whether there were other candidates out there first -- I did,\" he said. \"But there aren\\'t.\"\\n\\nHowever, McBroom isn\\'t distancing himself from the findings of his report, which followed an eight-month investigation. The report debunked allegations of malfeasance and affirmed Biden\\'s more-than-150,000-vote victory in the state, concluding there was no basis or evidence to support repeated claims that the election results failed to reflect the will of the voters. The result in Michigan had, at the time, already been affirmed in court rulings and reviews conducted by the secretary of state.\\n\\n\"As is often the case, the truth is not as attractive or as immediately desirable as the lies and the lies contain elements of truth,\" McBroom said in a statement at the time, adding that many of the claims of fraud or theft were the result of \"a misunderstanding or an outright deception.\"\\n\\nThe report had McBroom facing a firestorm, with blowback from constituents and even Trump himself. McBroom said that while \"a very significant number of people\" remain convinced Trump was cheated in 2020, that energy has waned.\\n\\n\"As I and others have been able to explain to people what we found and what we didn\\'t find, and as those who continue to hold out the promise that they have the proof have actually failed to deliver on that, I think the fervor over that situation has diminished,\" he said. \"And I also think that a lot of folks who might not ever be convinced look at it and say, \\'Well, the best move at this point is to simply win this November and to stop trying to live in the past.\\'\"\\n\\n\"The same day I got criticism from [Trump], I got praise from President [Barack] Obama. My response to everyone who asked about it was neither of them read the report,\" McBroom said of the response to his findings, which also offered support for Republican-backed changes to voting laws in the state. (McBroom said certain changes to state voting administration ahead of the 2020 election contributed to the distrust in the results.)\\n\\n\"I would have loved to have had that moment to sit down [with Trump] and actually chat it out, discuss what I found,\" McBroom continued. \"But I never had that opportunity.\"\\n\\nAsked about McBroom\\'s endorsement, as well as support from recent GOP critics, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in an email that those officials are a part of a growing coalition forming to topple Biden.\\n\\n\"Americans from all backgrounds, including Republicans, independents and disillusioned Democrats, are coalescing around President Trump and joining the greatest political movement in history so we can end Joe Biden\\'s chaos and make America strong, safe, and successful again,\" she said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the state Democratic Party said McBroom\\'s endorsement provided further evidence of Trump\\'s total takeover of the Michigan GOP.\\n\\n\"Senator Ed McBroom should be ashamed of himself,\" party Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement. \"Of all people, he knows just how dangerous Trump is and the threat he poses to our democracy here in Michigan. This is just another example of the fact that at its core, the Michigan GOP has fully embraced Trump and his MAGA extremism.\"\\n\\nAs for his message to voters in his home state this fall about the legitimacy of elections there, McBroom said that despite changes he feels have made the vote \"less secure,\" there \"are still significant safeguards and processes in place that if somebody does something bad it will immediately just show.\"\\n\\n\"But most of all, here in Michigan, the election is so localized with your local people,\" he added. \"That and it\\'s so bipartisan. You\\'ve got clerks of all walks of life on both sides of the aisle. You\\'ve got the polling place workers and everything. It\\'s our friends and neighbors. And to believe that one of them is trying to steal the election would be awful. But more than that, to believe they\\'re part of a huge conspiracy, one way or the other, is impossible.\"\\n\\nUnlike in 2020, when Biden led Trump in nearly every poll of Michigan, Trump has run ahead of Biden this time around in most recent surveys of the state, including one by Quinnipiac University this month. To an extent, that has surprised McBroom, who experienced the GOP wipeout in his state during the most recent midterm elections and hasn\\'t sensed that the suburban counties that were at the heart of Trump\\'s defeat -- as his report detailed -- have suddenly changed course.\\n\\nBut, McBroom said, the early survey results could be showing that Trump is stronger in Michigan\\'s cities than he was in 2016 or 2020. And he continues to enjoy robust strength in the state\\'s rural communities, McBroom said.\\n\\n\"So it\\'s possible that he can still assemble a winning coalition, something that a year ago I doubted very much but am now beginning to be convinced is possible after all,\" he said.\\n\\nApproaching four years since the 2020 vote, Trump hasn\\'t retreated from his view that the election was stolen. On the trail and on his Truth Social platform, Trump still regularly promotes the false notion that he was robbed. McBroom would like to see him move on.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that it\\'s a great message. I don\\'t think it helps advance what are his real strong points,\" McBroom said, citing his economic agenda and promotion of \"peace through strength,\" among other things. \"I don\\'t think he needs to continue to beat that drum.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240318-Ed-McBroom-se-250p-3cca6b.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 448625192, 'relevance': 1}\n",

It killed him.\\n\\nShawwa, 41, was \"gentle, kind, and effective, a dedicated humanitarian,\" I was told by Sean Carroll, the CEO of the nonprofit American aid agency Anera, which has been delivering humanitarian relief in the Middle East since 1968. Shawwa had been a valued member of Anera\\'s staff for nearly 15 years.\\n\\nWhat makes his death on March 8 all the more heartbreaking is that Anera\\'s staff had been \"deconflicted\" -- or checked out, according to Israeli requirements. In addition, \"Anera had given Israelis the map coordinates for the residences of all our staff,\" added Carroll, \"including screenshots of the buildings where they lived.\" All of this had been rechecked again with Israeli forces only four days before the missile killed Shawwa.\\n\\nMakes you wonder, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nThe missile also killed other refugees sheltering in the same house, and injured Shawwa\\'s wife and daughter. The strike critically injured Shawwa\\'s 6-year-old son, whom Anera staff desperately tried to evacuate to the United Arab Emirates, since Israeli strikes have pretty much destroyed Gaza\\'s health-care facilities.\\n\\nYet, despite pleas from heads of other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and even senior UAE officials, Anera couldn\\'t get him through Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints and out the Rafah crossing in time to make a plane out of El Arish, Egypt, on Friday. The boy died.\\n\\nShawwa\\'s death is one grim indicator of why the acute food shortage in the Gaza Strip has become so devastating that \"famine is imminent,\" according to a global agency that monitors food security for U.N. agencies and aid groups.\\n\\nAround 200 humanitarian aid workers from the United Nations and private international aid agencies have been killed, said Carroll. This makes it harder to distribute what aid does get in, as workers stay home for fear of dying.\\n\\n\" READ MORE: Gaza needs humanitarian aid now -- with or without a cease-fire | Trudy Rubin\\n\\nMeantime, hungry civilians in northern Gaza and Rafah make do on one meal a day -- or none. Children line up for hours hoping for some soup to feed their entire family. Desperate Palestinians now sheltering in tents attack the few food trucks that enter -- as Israel fails to ease bureaucratic and political hurdles that block more aid from crossing into Gaza.\\n\\nThe Biden administration\\'s last-ditch effort to drop pallets of food along Gaza\\'s shore only highlights how absurd Jerusalem\\'s food policy has become. Israel\\'s staunchest ally -- which protects it at the United Nations, sends military aid, and supports its right to self-defense -- is forced to use such inadequate methods by Israel itself.\\n\\nHow embarrassing is that? And Washington\\'s efforts to build a temporary landing dock for large deliveries of aid will take another two months at best.\\n\\nNo wonder President Joe Biden is angry at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. No wonder Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made a passionate speech urging, among other things, a new election in hopes of changing Israel\\'s leadership.\\n\\nBoth see that Netanyahu\\'s self-destructive starvation policy is playing right into Hamas\\' hands.\\n\\nOf course, the administration recognizes that Hamas leaders are using Palestinians as human shields, hiding deep below in tunnels Israel tries to destroy by bombing from above. But Hamas has no compunction about civilian casualties if they further its aim of winning sympathy for the Palestinian cause -- and increasing hostility toward Israel around the world, including among many young people in the United States.\\n\\nAs Columbia University terrorism expert Page Fortna wrote in the Israeli paper Haaretz, \"Hamas leaders know they cannot defeat the [Israel Defense Forces] militarily. Their only hope is to provoke Israel into killing enough civilians to defeat Israel politically. This is a classic terrorist strategy of provocation. Israel has fallen for it, hard.\"\\n\\nAnd as Nimrod Novik, former foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres, and executive board member of Commanders for Israel\\'s Security, told me weeks ago: \"If you want the support of the international community for more time [to destroy Hamas], you have to show this is not a war on Palestinian civilians.\"\\n\\n\"I would have sent 500 trucks of aid when the ask is 250,\" he added.\\n\\nInstead, driven by his hard-right ministers, who openly seek to drive Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank, Netanyahu has proved indifferent to civilian casualties. He insists that Israel will soon attack Rafah, where more than one million hungry civilians who have fled their homes are sheltering. Yet, Israel has yet to put forward any clear plan on how it would prevent further civilian carnage.\\n\\n\" READ MORE: U.S. must prevent a new humanitarian disaster in Gaza | Trudy Rubin\\n\\n\"Israel has not presented us or the world with a plan for how or where they would safely move those civilians, let alone feed and house them and ensure access to basic things like sanitation,\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a news briefing on Sunday.\\n\\nSo, whether Israel and Hamas reach a humanitarian cease-fire, Biden should demand -- not beg -- that Israel prevent the predicted famine. At this point, White House policy is more pro-Israel than Netanyahu\\'s, a leader who is dragging his country to a military dead end, all to pacify his far-right allies so he can keep power and stay out of jail.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters\\' criticism of Schumer for interfering in Israeli affairs is grotesque hypocrisy, given that the GOP welcomed Netanyahu to address Congress in a 2015 pre-election year without even clearing it with then-President Barack Obama. As for Trump\\'s disgusting claim that Americans who support Democrats \"hate Israel,\" this comes from the mouth of a man who dines with, and praises, domestic and foreign antisemites.\\n\\nAnyone who truly cares about Israel should ponder Mousa Shawwa\\'s death, and how a Gaza famine would not only be a humanitarian disaster but would rebound on Israel.

Learn more.\\n\\nThe real estate industry is at war, and everyone seems to have an opinion about how to make changes to the status quo while saving a world that works for buyer\\'s and seller\\'s agents.\\n\\nThe National Association of Realtors made a major tactical move last week when it reluctantly reached a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in a slate of landmark lawsuits. The agreement, if approved in court, would protect about 1 million agents and brokers from the nearly two-dozen lawsuits filed by homesellers across the country.\\n\\nBased on reaction to the news, the terms of the settlement and protection it offered fell short of unifying the industry, with some agents and brokers wondering whether NAR brokered the best deal for them -- even as others questioned if the trade organization should have continued the fight in court.\\n\\nBut the settlement was merely the latest episode to expose the fissures that have emerged in a real estate industry navigating a multi-front battle.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been saying the same thing for a while,\" said James Dwiggins, CEO of NextHome. \"We needed to come together with a settlement and move forward with it.\"\\n\\nThe industry once showed a united front as lawsuits mounted, but the chasm started to emerge in the weeks before the Sitzer | Burnett trial. And even now, with proposed settlements piling up, the divisions persist.\\n\\nAmong other things, nearly 100 brokerages weren\\'t covered by the proposed settlement, including HomeServices of America, its affiliates, and any that did more than $2 billion in sales volume in 2022. Brokerages big and small across the country have to choose between accepting change or fighting. Things are coming to a head.\\n\\nMost seem to agree the future will look different -- they just can\\'t agree on how it will change or the best route to a smooth landing.\\n\\n\"There are two types of agents,\" Mike Repka, CEO and broker of the Palo Alto-based DeLeon Realty, told Inman. \"Those looking at what\\'s going on and saying, \\'How can I adapt and enhance the experience for clients in this new post-Sitzer landscape?\\' There are other agents I\\'m hearing just kind of complaining to each other saying, \\'This is terrible and we won\\'t show any houses that don\\'t pay 2.5 percent,\\' which is exactly what the whole case was about. Those agents will fail.\"\\n\\n\"There are really two camps,\" Dwiggins agreed. \"There\\'s the camp of \\'fight it and go down that road.\\' There is almost zero chance that an appeal will work. Period.\"\\n\\nWith real estate at a crossroads, these are the key players and what they\\'re saying today.\\n\\nTHE ARGUMENT: Brokerages and franchisers hashed out agreements with plaintiffs to make changes to the way they and their brokers do business and paid hundreds of millions collectively to the plaintiffs. In exchange, they receive protection from the lawsuits as they continue to mount across the country.\\n\\nWhen Anywhere Real Estate CEO Ryan Schneider took the stage at Inman Connect New York in January, he gave some of his only public comments since his company became the first to settle Sitzer | Burnett in September and made clear why his firm was the first to settle. The industry lacks leadership, he said, and settling the case put Anywhere in the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n\"We did it because I want to have leadership, time and money to focus on agents, not litigation,\" Schneider said. \"We did it because I want to take care of our agents and franchisees and protect them from those 20 lawsuits and then the next 20, which are probably inevitable.\"\\n\\nHe also said settling the cases offered Anywhere brokerages and agents a level of protection unavailable elsewhere.\\n\\n\"We have our own view and vision of what\\'s good for this industry and it doesn\\'t always align with other people,\" Schneider said. \"Once you kind of have a clear vision of what you think is the right thing, you\\'ve gotta find a way to get there. If that means you separate from people who don\\'t have that vision, then so be it.\"\\n\\nThe industry had been showing a united front in the weeks leading up to the Sitzer trial, when Anywhere announced it had reached an agreement to settle. Weeks later, RE/MAX settled, too.\\n\\nKeller Williams followed in February; the company had been publicly resolute in its desire to fight the Sitzer verdict with NAR and HomeServices of America. But around lunchtime on Feb. 1, Keller Williams announced it had reached a deal to settle several key cases -- Sitzer, Moehrl and Nosalek -- and agreed to pay $70 million and make some changes to the way it does business.\\n\\nThese are the compromisers that, whether out of a necessity for survival or as an attempt to create a strategic advantage against competitors, agreed to make changes that were supported by plaintiffs and attorneys suing them.\\n\\n\"In regard to the settlement, what you see is business prudence,\" said Victor Lund, a founding partner with WAV Group. \"They look at a cost-benefit analysis of settling versus fighting. For those who settled, the cost-benefit analysis was, \\'Hey, the settlement is a good deal. We\\'ll take it.\\'\"\\n\\nAnywhere agreed to pay $83.5 million as part of the settlement agreement. RE/MAX will pay $55 million. Along with Keller Williams, the groups agreed to no longer compel their members to belong to NAR. The firms will prohibit brokers from claiming buyer agent services are free, and all must limit the practice of sorting listings by offers of compensation.\\n\\nMore and more, this group of compromisers appear to believe that change is inevitable; it\\'s just a matter of when and how.\\n\\n\"Every single person who owns a large brokerage or franchise, mine included, has talked to lawyers about what our outcomes are like,\" Dwiggins said. \"There\\'s no scenario where we all haven\\'t had that discussion at this point.\"\\n\\n\"All paths, in my opinion, lead to settlement,\" Dwiggins said.\\n\\nNAR had been marching forward after the verdict, signaling up until just days before news of its settlement broke that it planned to stay in the court fight. Indeed the organization was the biggest and most prominent non-compromiser in the industry.\\n\\nThat all changed Friday morning when the trade group announced its settlement.\\n\\n\"We have always wanted to reduce the significant strain on our members and provide a path forward for the industry,\" NAR President Kevin Sears said in a statement Friday.\\n\\nKEY PLAYERS\\n\\nTHE ARGUMENT: The deep thinkers closely studying the Sitzer | Burnett verdict and statements by the Department of Justice believe they have determined what they view as changes necessary to move ahead.\\n\\nNAR\\'s settlement was significant in that it promised sweeping changes to the rules that brokers and agents follow when transacting real estate.\\n\\nThose changes seemed to follow guidance from a group of industry reformers who examined the landscape and began to think of policy shifts that might appease a Department of Justice that has shown an intense interest in the matter.\\n\\n\"We lost. Now we need to look forward,\" Dwiggins said. \"I don\\'t believe that the verdict was correct, for the record. But we are where we are now.\"\\n\\nDwiggins is among a cohort of reformers who came up with a list of ideas that coincidentally ended up as the framework for NAR\\'s proposed settlement. For instance, this group of reformers has argued that the industry needed to consider whether all agents should be compelled to use buyer representation agreements, rather than to leave it up to brokerages to decide.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t we as an industry mandate it?\" Edward Zorn -- general counsel for the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS) and another prominent member of the pro-reform cohort -- said on stage at Inman Connect New York in January.\\n\\nAs part of the proposed settlement, NAR has said it would implement a rule by mid-July requiring agents to have a signed buyer representation agreement before touring a home with a client.\\n\\nAnother change the reformers called for was to remove all offers of compensation from the MLS.\\n\\n\"It is very, very realistic to see that occur where it\\'s not a field that you can put zero, which is what everyone\\'s talking about. It\\'s that field is gone,\" Dwiggins said last month. \"Like, there is no contractual offer of compensation in the MLS.\"\\n\\nHere again, the reformers have had some success; NAR agreed to create a rule removing offers of compensation from the MLS as part of the settlement.\\n\\nOther reformers include Mauricio Umansky, CEO of The Agency, and Compass agent Jason Haber. The two announced at Inman Connect New York they\\'re rolling out a new trade organization called the American Real Estate Association, which would compete with NAR.\\n\\nIt has yet to be seen in what ways the group would differ from NAR. But Haber says there is reason to be optimistic about its potential to make a difference. Haber and Umansky hosted a meeting this month inviting agents and brokers from across the country to share their ideas for a competing trade group. Hundreds attended, Haber said.\\n\\n\"Standards around the country should be raised,\" Haber told Inman. \"Raise the bar of entry, and reduce the agent count.\"\\n\\nKEY PLAYERS\\n\\nTHE ARGUMENT: The industry establishment players who plan to resist change and believe they can defeat homeseller and buyer plaintiffs -- and their trial lawyers -- by making their case in court. Billions of dollars are on the line.\\n\\nHomeServices is the biggest fighter and has signaled it still has no intention of settling the cases.\\n\\nDefiance to the pressure created by the Sitzer verdict also appears to be trickling down to the state and local levels who look to NAR for guidance and leadership.\\n\\n\"Our approach to litigation and the strategies we employ are decided upon by our leadership team, focusing on what is best for our brands, agents and consumers,\" said Chris Kelly, executive vice president of HomeServices of America. \"Each decision is based on the individual merits and specifics of the case.\"\\n\\nOn March 18, attorneys for the Sitzer | Burnett plaintiffs asked the court to order HomeServices to pay the vast majority of the damages awarded in a jury verdict this fall: $4.7 billion.\\n\\nThe framework of the settlement also means that 96 brokerages -- including major names such as eXp Realty -- that were left out now have to decide whether they become fighters or join the reformers and compromisers.\\n\\n\"Our team is committed to guiding you through any regional rule adaptations as they unfold,\" eXp Chief Strategy Officer Leo Pareja wrote in an email to eXp employees three days ago. \"Meanwhile, eXp Realty\\'s legal stance remains unwavering.\"\\n\\nNAR settled only reluctantly and may have been compelled by the risks of moving ahead in court. Now, other brokerages will have to make the same calculation.\\n\\n\"No one has deep enough pockets to pay the ruling,\" Lund said. \"Everyone would have to go bankrupt except for Berkshire Hathaway.\"\\n\\nKey Players\\n\\nTHE ARGUMENT: These are the forces behind the scenes or in the courtroom. The DOJ is out to create what it says would be a more competitive marketplace in real estate, sharing its opinions with judges along the way.\\n\\nGuiding much of the debate are the referees, namely Merrick Garland\\'s Department of Justice and the judges overseeing the countless cases.\\n\\nWith new cases being filed across the country, a panel of judges is set to hear arguments about potentially consolidating most of them into one multi-jurisdictional case this month.\\n\\nStephen R.

JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Welcome to our three-state trip in two days. Exciting.\\n\\nAll right. This afternoon, in Las Vegas, the President will double down on his plan to lower housing costs for American families. Under his leadership, we have already taken action to lower housing costs and increase the housing supply by reducing mortgage insurance premiums, expanding rental assistance, and building tens of thousands of affordable housing units.\\n\\nWhile on the ground, the President will meet directly with everyday Americans, everyday people who have been able to secure affordable housing as a result of these investments.\\n\\nIn this state alone, the President's American Rescue Plan, which every Republican in Congress voted against, provided $1 billion dollars to boost affordable housing, lower -- lower housing costs, and keep hone- -- homeowners and renters in their homes.\\n\\nStill, the President knows that more must be done to help American families who are still struggling with the cost of housing. That's why he's calling on Congress to pass his housing plan, which some of -- some experts are calling the most consequential housing plan in more than 50 years.\\n\\nThe President's plan would build on the efforts we have already taken to lower -- lower housing costs by providing a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, cracking down on corporate actions that rip off renters, and building and renovating more than 2 million homes.\\n\\nRepublicans in Congress should pass the President's plan to lower housing costs rather than try to cut taxes for the wealthy and large corporations. And you'll hear that from the President later today.\\n\\nWith that, Seung Min.\\n\\nQ Does the White House have a reaction to the spending deal that the congressional leaders reached? And is the White House satisfied with how that package approaches DHS funding, in particular?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we put out a statement this morning. You probably were not able to see it --\\n\\nSo, this agreement on the six remaining funding bills, including DHS -- this agreement abides by the Fiscal Responsibility Act and provides the remaining agencies with funding through the rest of the fiscal year.\\n\\nThe House and Senate appropriations committees are in the process of finalizing the text for Congress to review and pass as soon as possible to keep the government open, and the President will sign it immediately.\\n\\nCongress must also pass the bipartisan national security supplemental. As you know, it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. We want to see the -- the -- we want to see the Speaker put that on the floor and -- this is -- and -- and also the border sec- -- border agreement, which also came out on the Senate -- obviously, wasn't passed out of the Senate because of politics -- politics was put -- put in the way of even moving forward the border agreement -- but to provide reforms and funding needed to secure the border.\\n\\nAnd so, we want to see those two -- the border -- border agreement negotiations go through the process. And we want to see the national security supplemental that was passed by 70-29 out of the Senate go to the floor of -- of the House so that we know -- we know for a fact that we would see overwhelming support from the House. We want to see that movement as soon as possible.\\n\\nQ And does the administration have any more specifics on when that meeting with the Israeli officials will take place with the administration --\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, so, we're working on scheduling and preparations. It will likely be early next week, is what we're anticipating. But obviously, we'll let you know more when we have more to share.\\n\\nJust to give you a little bit of what Jake said yesterday. So, ye- -- so, the President asked Prime Minister to send senior interagency team r- -- composed of military, intelligence, and humanitarian officials to Washington in the upcoming days, as I said, probably early next week.\\n\\nAs far as who on our side, it'll be senior members from the administration acro- -- across the administration will participate.\\n\\nQ Karine, can you give us an update about the peace talks going on in Qatar today? And also a comment on -- the U.N. Human Rights Agency said that because famine is coming closer or already there in Gaza, that would be a war crime by Israel. Does the United States view that as well?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, what I can say is this, as it relates to the report that we all -- all of you has been reporting on. So, we certainly are deeply concerned about the report yesterday indicating, as you just stated in your question, about the imminent famine in Gaza. And so, as the report makes clear, despite ongoing and tireless efforts, including by this administration, the amount of aid reaching people in Gaza and particularly those most need -- need remains insufficient.\\n\\nSo, we have been clear that there is more that needs to be done and that this report is a stark and devastating reminder of this.\\n\\nEveryone needs to do more. Israel needs to provide sustained and un- -- unimpeded access for assistance to enter both Northern and Southern Gaza. Donors, the international community also need to make sure that the right type of assistance is getting to the most vulnerable.\\n\\nObviously, this is why we've been working towards the hostage deal to make sure that -- not only that we get a temporary ceasefire to get those hostages home -- let's not forget, there are also American hostages that are being held by Hamas -- but also to get that all-important, needed aid to the -- to the Palestinian people in Gaza.\\n\\nSo, we're continuing to do that work. I know that Jake spoke to this as well when he was at the -- at the podium yesterday. So, we're going to continue to push forward and do everything that we can to get that hostage deal so that we can get more humanitarian aid and, obviously, get hostages home.\\n\\nAnd we're -- we're up -- as you know, we're increasing our humanitarian efforts into Gaza with the pier, with the airdrops. And, also, as you know, we also announced more funding -- more humanitarian funding over the past week or so. So, that is -- that is our -- and we see that as an imperative, and we're going to continue to do that work.\\n\\nQ And -- and specifically on the allegation that Israel is using hunger as a weapon, which would be considered a war crime?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I -- obviously, I can't speak to that. What I can speak to is the efforts that we are making to make sure that we're getting humanitarian aid into -- into Gaza. We've had conversations, as I've stated in -- earlier, with the Israeli government to -- for them also to do more in getting that humanitarian aid, getting the trucks in -- right? -- getting -- and doing more, keeping -- keeping those -- keeping -- keeping that going.\\n\\nAnd so, that's what I can speak to at this time.\\n\\nQ Karine, Hong -- Hong Kong passed its controversial new security law -- Hong Kong.\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, Hong Kong. Okay.\\n\\nQ An- -- and I was wondering if you guys had any reaction or if you were at all concerned about the impact on American businesses that were operating there.\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I -- I saw that reporting. I haven't had a chance to talk to our team yet so -- so I can give you a full- -- full-throated answer. So, I'm going to have to go back. But I saw that this morning. I just haven't had a chance to have the conversation.\\n\\nQ One other one on Ukraine. There have been a series of Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy facilities that are processing oil. Is that a concern that the U.S. has, that it could potentially lead to higher global oil prices? And is that something that you've conveyed to the Ukrainians?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the President has done everything that he can to deal with -- to deal with oil. Obviously, lowing down -- lowering -- the actions that he took led to lowering gas prices. So, we're -- we're always monitoring. We're always watching. I don't have anything specific on -- on what could potentially happen in that particular incident. But, obviously, this is something that we monitor and keep --\\n\\nQ Karine, on Ukraine. There's been some talk among Republicans about possibly making aid to them a loan. What is the White House's thoughts on that?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look -- and I just said this moments ago: The House needs to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental. That's what we need to see. We saw it come out of the Senate -- again, I just said this earlier -- 70 to 29. It is imperative that gets done.\\n\\nUkraine needs -- needs the assistance. We have to continue our commitment to the brave people of Ukraine as they're fighting and doing everything that they can to fight for their democracy. So, we got to -- the Speaker has to bring it to the floor. He has to put politics aside. We know what happens when you don't -- when we don't stop a dictator, when we don't address tyranny.\\n\\nAnd so, that's what we're going to continue to call for. And we're going to stay steadfast on that.\\n\\nQ In a -- in a new book, former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer expresses his concern about the direction of the Supreme Court. A new article in The Atlantic also calls for Justice Sonia Sotomayor to retire. Where does the White House stand, kind of, in a post-Dobbs world on Supreme Court reform? And has the White House considered asking Justice Sotomayor to retire?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, that's a personal decision for her to make. That is something that -- (laughs) -- that she has to make. It's not something that we make -- we -- we lean in on or get involved in. So, I'm not even going to address that -- that question.\\n\\nAs it relates to the Supreme Court, look, we saw\\n\\nwhat happened with Dobbs -- the Dobbs decision. We saw, with that decision, it led to Republicans introducing three national -- national abortion bans. And that has caused -- because of the Dobb's decision, because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it's caused chaos.\\n\\nYou've heard us talk about IVF, how now there's legislation -- we saw legislation in Alabama to take away the right for a family to make a decision -- right? -- for -- you know, for a couple or for an individual to make a decision on when to start a family. And that's because of the chaos that -- overturning Roe v. Wade.\\n\\nAnd so, the Supreme Court made that decision. It was very clear what the last President said. He wanted to put -- put together a Supreme Court that would do that, that would overturn Roe v. Wade. And so, we've seen their action. We've seen it with affirmative action, what they've been able to do there.\\n\\nAnd so, I think that speaks -- their actions speak for themselves. I'm just not going to go beyond that.\\n\\nQ Karine, Chef Jos√© Andr√©s was pretty critical of the President's efforts to get humanitarian aid and specifically food on the ground in Gaza. This is a person who obviously works to feed people all over the world, and he said the efforts from the White House weren't enough, the maritime direction wasn't the best way to go.\\n\\nWho is the White House working with on the ground to get that sense of what the best way forward is to feed people in Gaza?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, as you know, there are organizations on the ground -- right? -- that -- that we work with and that we know are -- are helping and assisting getting more aid to -- to Palestinians in -- Palestinian citizens in Gaza. So, that is obviously a way that -- that we have seen that process go.\\n\\nLook, we have upped our -- we've upped what we've been trying to do in getting more aid -- more humanitarian aid into Gaza. We believe a mar- -- the maritime -- the pier is one way to do that. The airdrops is another way to do that. We are doing everything that we can to get that hostage deal.\\n\\nWe understand what's happening in Gaza. There's a humanitarian crisis that innocent Palestinians are dealing with, and so, obviously, we take -- we're very concerned about that. And we're going to do everything that we can to continue those efforts.\\n\\nWe know we need to up our efforts. And so, that's why you've heard us almost every week announcing new ways to do that.\\n\\nWe have to get this hostage deal. We are -- we are doing -- working 24/7, leaning in, and trying to make sure that we get that -- get that hostage deal, so that we have a temporary ceasefire so that we can -- we can get that all-important aid into -- into Gaza. So, that's been a -- very much a big focus, as well as getting American -- American hostages and hostages, obviously, back home to their friends and families.\\n\\nQ Did you guys see the statement from the chef? Do you have a specific reaction?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: What I can speak to is our efforts here. And we've been pretty consistent. You know, we've been talking about ways that we're trying to make sure that we get that aid in. We understand what the crisis that's going on in -- in Gaza. We see it, you know, and -- and we want to do everything that we can to get that aid in.\\n\\nAnd so, you've heard from USAID. You've heard from the State Department. Sec- -- Secre- -- Secretary Blinken right now is in the region, which is important -- having important, critical diplomatic conversation. That's going to include humanitarian aid.\\n\\nAnd so, the President and his team has been really, really focused on that -- that approach as well: getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.\\n\\nQ We're heading to a couple of border states. In Arizona and in Texas, they're considering laws that would essentially make officers able to arrest undocumented immigrants they suspect crossed to the state illegally. Is there more that the White House can do to prevent these states from essentially setting up their own immigration enforcement laws?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I've -- I've mentioned this multiple times already. We got to get that border supp- -- that border deal -- that border security deal done. We need to provide DHS with more funding, more -- with more resources to actually deal with the challenges at the border.\\n\\nAnd so, that has been our focus. Let's not forget, this se- -- this -- this border security deal was a bipartisan deal that came out of the Senate -- Republicans, Democrats. It took us months to get the -- to get us there.\\n\\nThe President directed his -- his team to work with them. And -- and we were able to get something done that was supported by the Border Patrol union, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is something that you don't see in this type of political discourse. Right? And we were able to get that done.\\n\\nNow, Republicans blocked it because of politics, because of the former President. And if we want to be where a majority of Americans are -- wanting to deal with the immigration system, wanting to deal with the challenges of the border -- we got to get this done.\\n\\nAnd so that's our answer there: We want to move forward. We think that the Senate and the House need to -- need to get that done. We have -- we have a deal. We have a negotiation that took months to get done -- months to get done that will actually address this issue or start the process.\\n\\nIt -- if it is put into law, it would be the toughest and the fairest immigration border security deal that we have seen in years. And so, that's what the President has been -- continued to -- to speak to, and that's what we want to see.\\n\\nQ Going back to the loan question. I mean, obviously, I know the White House's preference is for that supplemental to pass the House. But is the loan option something that the administration has researched, whether it's OMB or elsewhere, whether it's even possible or workable in the way that some Republicans have been discussing it?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, rather than go back to basics, we're -- we don't -- we want to see -- we want to see --\\n\\n(A reporter picks up a binder tab and returns it to Ms. Jean-Pierre.)\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Is that mine? Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much. My tab. (Laughter.)\\n\\nWe want see the bipartisan -- the bipartisan nat- -national -- national security supplemental. We -- we don't want to go back to basics. That's not what we want to see, and time is running out.\\n\\nWe've talked about this over and over again. You've heard from Jake. You've heard from my colleagues at NSC. You know, we see that Ukraine -- because of the inaction of Congress over the last couple of months, Ukraine is actually losing ground in the battlefield. And it is, you know, due to our inaction.\\n\\nAnd so, they're fighting for their sovereignty. They're fighting for their democracy. And we know what it means if we don't get involved here, if we don't stop a dictator. You know, they're fighting against a tyrant. And so, that is the best way to deal with what -- to give Ukraine what they need is to get that national supplemental passed.\\n\\nAnd we know -- we know for a fact that there are multiple Republican congressional members in the House who have said that they would vote for it if it goes to the floor. We know where Democrats are on this. So, overwhelming support. The Speaker has to put it to the floor and not put -- and not get -- let politics get in the way.\\n\\nQ Karine, former President Barack Obama was at 10 Downing Street yesterday. Did he give the White House a heads-up on that meeting? And do you know what he discussed?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, yes, we were aware in advance of the meeting, and President Biden's -- Pre- -- pardon me, Presid- -- President Obama's team reached out to the White House ahead of the meeting.\\n\\nBut as we -- and I think it's been reported that this was an informal courtesy call conducted by a private citizen in his personal capacity. It's -- it's not our -- it's not our conversation to speak to. We leave it to the pres- -- the -- President Obama and his personal office to speak to. But yes, obviously, we were given a heads up.\\n\\nQ When was the last time President Biden and President Obama spoke?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don't have a call to read out to all of you. But as you know, they're close; they're like family. They speak regularly. And just don't have anything -- don't have anything else to share.\\n\\nAll right --\\n\\nQ Karine, the admin- -- the administration is announcing that it is soft- -- is softening fuel economy standards, which will slow the -- slow the transition to electric vehicles. Is there any concern in the White House that that will make it harder for President Biden to achieve his overall climate goals?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, we don't have any concerns. Look, the President is really proud of the historic piece of legislation that he was able to get done as it relates to electric vehicles. Obviously, the Inflation Reduction Act is a part of that. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation is a part of that. And so, we're -- we're going to stay really focused on -- on the goal ahead. But no, we don't have\\n\\nconcerns.\\n\\nQ But is the -- the need to, sort of, be less stringent with the fuel economy standards an acknowledgement that the infrastructure just isn't there yet and that the demand just isn't there yet for EVs?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the Infla- -- the Inflation Reduction Act was so critical and important because it was the -- it was the most comprehensive piece of legislation -- now, law, obviously -- to deal with climate change. And the Pre- -- the President is certainly focused on that. It is a -- he called it, when he walked in, part of one of the four crises that we had to deal with not just as a cou- -- a country but as a -- the world -- right? -- which is the climate change crisis.\\n\\nSo, look, we know with these types of things it takes -- it takes time. And we understand that, but we're still going to stay committed to our goals.\\n\\nQ The White House (inaudible) said the President would sign legislation to force ByteDance to sell TikTok. But has the President spoken with senators to ask them to vote for the bill? And is the White House encouraging the Senate to move on this quickly?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we've encour- -- we -- we welcome the bill. We've said that. We've said that before -- it -- while it was going through the House, when it came out of the House. This is a divestment. This is not about banning TikTok. That's how we see this bill, how -- that's how it's written.\\n\\nAnd so, obviously, we have provided technical support for -- for this legislation. It's in the Senate now. The Senate is -- is taking a look at it.\\n\\nI don't have any calls to read out that the President has had with any members of the Senate or Congress or congressional members on this particular piece of legislation. But, look, we welcome it. We think it's important to this -- this legislation -- this is a divestment bill, not a ban. And so, I'll just leave it there.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nQ I think when you first spoke to the TikTok legislation at the briefing, you mentioned the legal issues that the White House had raised and were working out with the sponsors. Have those technical issues, legal issues been fixed?\\n\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I -- I don't have an update for you on that. Obviously, we think that's important, right? And we're providing those technical assistance, as I just mentioned. I just don't have an update on where they are in that process.\\n\\nBut it's in the Senate. The Senate is looking at it. We welcome the bill. We think it's important to deal -- to deal with the -- to -- and I think this is something that the National Security Advisor said -- right? -- just last week, which is we -- it -- it is incredibly important to know where data lives -- where privacy data -- where American data lives. Does it live here or does it live in China? Right? When we talk about ownership, is ownership here or is ownership in China?\\n\\nAnd we want to make sure that -- that we're able to protect -- it's about national security, right? -- protect that data. And so, that's what you're seeing.\\n\\nIt's a divestment; it's not a ban. And so, we are providing technical support.\\n\\nNow, it's in the Senate. And so, we'll let it -- we'll let that process move forward.\", 'source': {'uri': 'globalsecurity.org', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GlobalSecurity.org'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_pike@globalsecurity.org', 'name': 'John Pike', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 448623919, 'relevance': 1}\n",

But this wasn\\'t just a typical rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner:\" it was a recording made by jailed individuals accused of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6th hostages,\" the announcer said. Trump saluted while the song played, his hand on the brim of a red Make America Great Again hat.\\n\\nThis is not the first time Trump has played the \"J6 Prison Choir\\'s\" recording of the national anthem. At the first rally of his presidential campaign in March 2023, Trump took the stage in Waco, Texas and put his hand over his heart while the recording played. Trump also kicked off a rally in Georgia this month with the Prison Choir recording.\\n\\nAfter the recording ended on Saturday, Trump said \"you see the spirit from the hostages\" and called them \"unbelievable patriots\" who have \"been treated terribly and very unfairly,\" even as there is reason to believe some Prison Choir members may have assaulted police officers.\\n\\nThe recording - titled \"Justice for All\" - was released commercially on March 3, 2023. It features Trump saying the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" while the Prison Choir sings the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\"\\n\\nIt is part of Trump\\'s efforts to try to whitewash what happened when a mob of his supporters overran the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\\'s victory.\\n\\nThe attack on the Capitol shocked the nation, led to Trump\\'s second impeachment and contributed to felony charges being filed against the former president for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said after Jan. 6 that Trump had \"totally discredited himself,\" according to the book \"This Will Not Pass.\"\\n\\n\"He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,\" McConnell said.\\n\\nYet much like Trump has tried to turn his 91 felony charges spanning four different criminal cases to his political advantage by portraying himself as the victim of overzealous prosecutors with political motivations, he has embraced the Jan. 6 defendants on the campaign trail.\\n\\nIt seems to have worked: he is now the presumptive Republican nominee and McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this month.\\n\\nTrump\\'s attempt to rewrite the history of Jan. 6 comes as the U.S. Department of Justice continues to charge more people with crimes stemming from that day.\\n\\nThe U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the District of Columbia announced earlier this month that 1,358 people have been charged with Jan. 6 crimes.\\n\\nOf those, 769 pled guilty and another 152 have been found guilty at trial so far.\\n\\nMany of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged with serious offenses.\\n\\n\"Approximately 486 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 127 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer,\" according to the Department of Justice, which estimates that 140 officers were assaulted on Jan. 6.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear which Jan. 6 defendants participated in the recording that Trump plays at his rallies, but many of the defendants held in the Washington D.C. jail around the time when the recording apparently was made assaulted officers.\\n\\nAn individual who advised the group that made the recording told the Washington Post that it was made in February of 2023 at the D.C. jail, but said she did not know who the singers are. Jan. 6 defendants in the D.C. jail regularly gathered at 9 p.m. to sing the national anthem. The recording\\'s producers declined to identify the singers to the Post, as did the Trump campaign.\\n\\nTrump promotes himself as a steadfast supporter of law enforcement and is running as a \"law and order\" candidate who would get tough on violent criminals.\\n\\n\"They\\'re the greatest people, the police,\" Trump said last year at a campaign event in Iowa.\\n\\nThe Trump campaign ignored a request by USA TODAY to identify the J6 Prison Choir members, and a question about the possibility that some Choir members assaulted police officers.\\n\\nInstead, Trump National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that \"Joe Biden\\'s Department of Justice has spent more time prosecuting President Trump and targeting Americans for peacefully protesting on January 6th than criminals, illegal immigrants, and terrorists who are committing violent crimes in Democrat-run cities every day. President Trump will restore justice for all Americas who have been unfairly treated by Joe Biden\\'s two-tier system of justice.\"\\n\\nAn analysis published by Just Security, an online forum hosted by the New York University School of Law, found that the vast majority of Jan. 6 defendants held in the D.C. Jail on March 13, 2023 were accused of assaulting officers.\\n\\nThe analysis was conducted by Tom Joscelyn, Norman Eisen and Fred Wertheimer. Joscelyn was a staff member on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, while Eisen served in President Barack Obama\\'s administration as special counsel. Wertheimer is president of Democracy 21, a good-government group that runs a \"TrumpWatch\" program.\\n\\nThey obtained a list from the D.C. Department of Corrections that included all of the Jan. 6 defendants held in the D.C. jail last year on March 13.\\n\\nThe list names 20 individuals, and 17 of them were accused of assaulting law enforcement officers.\\n\\n\"It\\'s highly likely that some of the people in the analysis are in that recording,\" by the Prison Choir, Joscelyn said.\\n\\nAmong the 17 are Shane Jenkins and Jonathan Mellis. Both men also were identified by the Washington Post as participating in a rendition of the National Anthem from the D.C. jail that was captured in a video posted online last year. The Post identified five individuals, including Jenkins and Mellis, among 15 in the video \"using physical characteristics and interviews with family members, supporters and attorneys.\"\\n\\nThe Trump campaign referred the Post to the video - which was posted online by one of the defendants lawyers on March 1 of last year - when asked about the origin of \"Justice for All.\"\\n\\nJenkins was sentenced in October to 84 months in prison.\\n\\nA Department of Justice press release states that \"Jenkins hurled nine different objects at the officers, including a solid wooden desk drawer... a flagpole, a metal walking stick, and a broken wooden pole with a spear-like point.\"\\n\\n\"In a message sent to an associate following the events of January 6th, Jenkins wrote, \\'I have murder in my heart and head... I\\'m not over this election,\\'\" according to the DOJ release.\\n\\nMellis was sentenced in December to 51 months in prison.\\n\\nCiting court documents, the Department of Justice said Mellis used a \"large wooden stick like a sword and stabbed at the faces and heads of officers at least five times, violently striking some officers in the face, head, neck, and body area.\"\\n\\nAnother man identified in the video analyzed by the Post and included in the report published by Just Security is William Chrestman, who is described by the Department of Justice as a member of the Kansas City chapter of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group.\\n\\nMembers of the Proud Boys are accused of helping orchestrate the attack on the Capitol. Former Proud Boy National Chairman Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the attack.\\n\\nTrump\\'s use of the Prison Choir recording isn\\'t the only way he has embraced Jan. 6 defendants. He also spoke at a fundraiser for them, talked about pardoning them and physically embraced one woman at a rally.\\n\\n\"I think he\\'s gone way beyond just trying to change the narrative around Jan. 6,\" Joscelyn said. \"I think he\\'s openly celebrating and endorsing Jan. 6. He\\'s become the pro Jan. 6 candidate. He\\'s saying the people who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 were in the right and everybody else was in the wrong, so that\\'s a morally inverted message that he\\'s preaching.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s efforts may be contributing to changing views on Jan. 6 among some voters.\\n\\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland Survey released in January, three years after the attack on the Capitol, shows that fewer Republicans now say the Jan. 6 protesters were \"mostly violent\" and that Trump is largely to blame for the riot when compared with a December 2021 survey. Just 14% of Republicans now say that Trump bears \"a great deal\" or \"good amount\" of blame for the attack, down from 27% in 2021, according to the Post.\\n\\nThe percentage of Republicans and independents who say punishments for Jan. 6 defendants have been \"fair\" or \"not harsh enough\" also has declined.\\n\\n\"There has definitely been serious movement from 2021 to 2023 when we did the two surveys, and so the question is: \\'Is there still room for movement?\\' said Michael Hanmer, who directs the University of Maryland\\'s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.\\n\\nBased on Trump\\'s pro-Jan.6 defendant actions, \"I think the conclusion of their campaign would have to be yes,\" Hanmer added.\\n\\nYet Trump also risks turning off some GOP voters the more he \"embraces the attack on the Capitol as a good thing,\" Hanmer said.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a sizeable minority within the Republican Party that showed signs on a number of questions that they are uncomfortable with how things are going,\" Hanmer said. \"I think it is a stretch in a lot of cases to suggest they might vote for Joe Biden but there\\'s a real chance it could influence their turnout decision.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/er6i7OU.XiXq6zeNcYgU1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/5b8579be73bb166648875e622f6a0437', 'eventUri': 'spa-3420009', 'sentiment': -0.09019607843137256, 'wgt': 448623432, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Suu Kyi\\'s lawyers had challenged the auction order.\\n\\nThe auction was held in front of the closed gates of the lakeside property, which has served as an unofficial party headquarters and a political shrine for the country\\'s pro-democracy movement. While living there, Suu Kyi hosted visiting dignitaries including U.S. President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\\n\\nSuu Kyi, 78, is serving a 27-year prison sentence in a series of cases brought by the military, which seized power from her elected government in February 2021. Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases are an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military\\'s seizure of power.\\n\\n\"I want to announce that the auction is unsuccessful as there is no bidder,\" a district court official who did not identify herself announced outside the gate. A man by her side struck a small gong, and a second man said: \"The auction event has ended.\"\\n\\nA lawyer familiar with the legal proceedings, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information, said the court will continue to handle the case but the details are not yet known.\\n\\nThe court-ordered auction followed a bitter decades-long legal dispute between Suu Kyi and her brother, Aung San Oo, who has sought an equal division of the property.\\n\\nAung San Oo first sued in 2000 for a partition of the property but his complaint was dismissed in January 2001 on procedural grounds. He returned to court repeatedly over the following two decades to press his claims.\\n\\nFeatured Local Savings\\n\\nThe Supreme Court decided in August 2022, after the army seized power, to have the property sold by auction.\\n\\nThe two-story colonial-style building was given decades ago by the government to Suu Kyi\\'s mother, Khin Kyi, after her husband, independence hero Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in July 1947.\\n\\nKhin Kyi died in December 1988, shortly after the failure of a mass uprising against military rule in which Suu Kyi was a leader and co-founder of the National League for Democracy party. She was detained in 1989 ahead of a 1990 election which her party easily won but was not allowed to take power when the army annulled the results.\\n\\nShe spent almost 15 of the following 21 years under house arrest at the property. For most of the time, she was alone with just a housekeeper, and at one point had to sell some of her furniture to afford food.\\n\\nShe remained there after her 2010 release until moving in 2012 to the capital, Naypyitaw, to serve in Parliament. She became the nation\\'s leader after a 2015 general election.\\n\\nEarly this month, Suu Kyi\\'s legal team filed an appeal at Yangon Region High Court requesting that the order to sell the house be amended because Suu Kyi did not seem to know about the auction and had not been allowed to meet and give instructions to her lawyers about it.\\n\\nThe auction was also challenged by the main organization that is coordinating opposition to the military government.

It features Trump saying the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" while the Prison Choir sings the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\"\\n\\nIt is part of Trump\\'s efforts to try to whitewash what happened when a mob of his supporters overran the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\\'s victory.\\n\\nThe attack on the Capitol shocked the nation, led to Trump\\'s second impeachment and contributed to felony charges being filed against the former president for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said after Jan. 6 that Trump had \"totally discredited himself,\" according to the book \"This Will Not Pass.\"\\n\\n\"He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,\" McConnell said.\\n\\nYet much like Trump has tried to turn his 91 felony charges spanning four different criminal cases to his political advantage by portraying himself as the victim of overzealous prosecutors with political motivations, he has embraced the Jan. 6 defendants on the campaign trail.\\n\\nIt seems to have worked: he is now the presumptive Republican nominee and McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this month.\\n\\nTrump\\'s attempt to rewrite the history of Jan. 6 comes as the U.S. Department of Justice continues to charge more people with crimes stemming from that day.\\n\\nThe U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the District of Columbia announced earlier this month that 1,358 people have been charged with Jan. 6 crimes.\\n\\nOf those, 769 pled guilty and another 152 have been found guilty at trial so far.\\n\\nMany of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged with serious offenses.\\n\\n\"Approximately 486 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 127 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer,\" according to the Department of Justice, which estimates that 140 officers were assaulted on Jan. 6.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear which Jan. 6 defendants participated in the recording that Trump plays at his rallies, but many of the defendants held in the Washington D.C. jail around the time when the recording apparently was made assaulted officers.\\n\\nAn individual who advised the group that made the recording told the Washington Post that it was made in February of 2023 at the D.C. jail, but said she did not know who the singers are. Jan. 6 defendants in the D.C. jail regularly gathered at 9 p.m. to sing the national anthem. The recording\\'s producers declined to identify the singers to the Post, as did the Trump campaign.\\n\\nTrump promotes himself as a steadfast supporter of law enforcement and is running as a \"law and order\" candidate who would get tough on violent criminals.\\n\\n\"They\\'re the greatest people, the police,\" Trump said last year at a campaign event in Iowa.\\n\\nThe Trump campaign ignored a request by USA TODAY to identify the J6 Prison Choir members, and a question about the possibility that some Choir members assaulted police officers.\\n\\nInstead, Trump National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that \"Joe Biden\\'s Department of Justice has spent more time prosecuting President Trump and targeting Americans for peacefully protesting on January 6th than criminals, illegal immigrants, and terrorists who are committing violent crimes in Democrat-run cities every day. President Trump will restore justice for all Americas who have been unfairly treated by Joe Biden\\'s two-tier system of justice.\"\\n\\nAn analysis published by Just Security, an online forum hosted by the New York University School of Law, found that the vast majority of Jan. 6 defendants held in the D.C. Jail on March 13, 2023 were accused of assaulting officers.\\n\\nThe analysis was conducted by Tom Joscelyn, Norman Eisen and Fred Wertheimer. Joscelyn was a staff member on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, while Eisen served in President Barack Obama\\'s administration as special counsel. Wertheimer is president of Democracy 21, a good-government group that runs a \"TrumpWatch\" program.\\n\\nThey obtained a list from the D.C. Department of Corrections that included all of the Jan. 6 defendants held in the D.C. jail last year on March 13.\\n\\nThe list names 20 individuals, and 17 of them were accused of assaulting law enforcement officers.\\n\\n\"It\\'s highly likely that some of the people in the analysis are in that recording,\" by the Prison Choir, Joscelyn said.\\n\\nAmong the 17 are Shane Jenkins and Jonathan Mellis. Both men also were identified by the Washington Post as participating in a rendition of the National Anthem from the D.C. jail that was captured in a video posted online last year. The Post identified five individuals, including Jenkins and Mellis, among 15 in the video \"using physical characteristics and interviews with family members, supporters and attorneys.\"\\n\\nThe Trump campaign referred the Post to the video - which was posted online by one of the defendants lawyers on March 1 of last year - when asked about the origin of \"Justice for All.\"\\n\\nJenkins was sentenced in October to 84 months in prison.\\n\\nA Department of Justice press release states that \"Jenkins hurled nine different objects at the officers, including a solid wooden desk drawer... a flagpole, a metal walking stick, and a broken wooden pole with a spear-like point.\"\\n\\n\"In a message sent to an associate following the events of January 6th, Jenkins wrote, \\'I have murder in my heart and head... I\\'m not over this election,\\'\" according to the DOJ release.\\n\\nMellis was sentenced in December to 51 months in prison.\\n\\nCiting court documents, the Department of Justice said Mellis used a \"large wooden stick like a sword and stabbed at the faces and heads of officers at least five times, violently striking some officers in the face, head, neck, and body area.\"\\n\\nAnother man identified in the video analyzed by the Post and included in the report published by Just Security is William Chrestman, who is described by the Department of Justice as a member of the Kansas City chapter of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group.\\n\\nMembers of the Proud Boys are accused of helping orchestrate the attack on the Capitol. Former Proud Boy National Chairman Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the attack.\\n\\nTrump\\'s use of the Prison Choir recording isn\\'t the only way he has embraced Jan. 6 defendants. He also spoke at a fundraiser for them, talked about pardoning them and physically embraced one woman at a rally.\\n\\n\"I think he\\'s gone way beyond just trying to change the narrative around Jan. 6,\" Joscelyn said. \"I think he\\'s openly celebrating and endorsing Jan. 6. He\\'s become the pro Jan. 6 candidate. He\\'s saying the people who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 were in the right and everybody else was in the wrong, so that\\'s a morally inverted message that he\\'s preaching.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s efforts may be contributing to changing views on Jan. 6 among some voters.\\n\\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland Survey released in January, three years after the attack on the Capitol, shows that fewer Republicans now say the Jan. 6 protesters were \"mostly violent\" and that Trump is largely to blame for the riot when compared with a December 2021 survey. Just 14% of Republicans now say that Trump bears \"a great deal\" or \"good amount\" of blame for the attack, down from 27% in 2021, according to the Post.\\n\\nThe percentage of Republicans and independents who say punishments for Jan. 6 defendants have been \"fair\" or \"not harsh enough\" also has declined.\\n\\n\"There has definitely been serious movement from 2021 to 2023 when we did the two surveys, and so the question is: \\'Is there still room for movement?\\' said Michael Hanmer, who directs the University of Maryland\\'s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.\\n\\nBased on Trump\\'s pro-Jan.6 defendant actions, \"I think the conclusion of their campaign would have to be yes,\" Hanmer added.\\n\\nYet Trump also risks turning off some GOP voters the more he \"embraces the attack on the Capitol as a good thing,\" Hanmer said.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a sizeable minority within the Republican Party that showed signs on a number of questions that they are uncomfortable with how things are going,\" Hanmer said. \"I think it is a stretch in a lot of cases to suggest they might vote for Joe Biden but there\\'s a real chance it could influence their turnout decision.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/er6i7OU.XiXq6zeNcYgU1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/5b8579be73bb166648875e622f6a0437', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.09019607843137256, 'wgt': 448623177, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Von wegen \"Country roads / take me home / to the place / I belong\". Das war ein Heile-Welt-Schlager f√ºr Bleif√º√üe auf dem Weg heim zur Mutti. Was aber, wenn der \"place I belong\" noch nicht gefunden wurde? Adrianne Lenker ist eine, die diesen Platz noch sucht. Dabei tr√§gt sie ihre Vergangenheit wie einen Rucksack voller Steine mit sich.\\n\\nLenker ist 32 und steht im Hauptberuf der Band Big Thief vor. Das ist eine US-amerikanische Folkrock-Band, was auf ihrem Label auff√§llt wie ein rotumrandeter Eiterpickel auf der Nasenspitze. Das Label ist britisch und hei√üt 4AD und ist f√ºr seine Pr√§senz im Countryrock eher nicht so bekannt, sieht man von der Formation Tarnation ab, die seinerzeit eine Art David-Lynch-dreht-einen-Spaghetti-Western-Musik gespielt hat.\\n\\nAdrianne Lenker hat nun ein neues Soloalbum aufgenommen, ihr f√ºnftes, und es wird am Freitag ver√∂ffentlicht. Es tr√§gt den hoffnungsfrohen Titel \"Bright Future\". Lenker hat in der Musik fr√ºh ein Ventil gefunden. Sie war noch keine zehn Jahre alt, als sie ihre ersten Songs schrieb, und gerade 15, als ihr erstes Album ver√∂ffentlicht wurde. Schon damals trug sie eher schwer.\\n\\nLenker wurde in eine religi√∂se, noch sehr junge Familie hineingeboren und erlebte die Sinnsuche ihrer Eltern in diversen Fundi-Sekten - inklusive Entsagungen und anschlie√üender reum√ºtiger Wiedereingemeindungen. Genug Stoff, um einen ordentlichen Schaden aufgeladen zu bekommen. Mit Big Thief schuf sie sich einen Ausweg.\\n\\nDie Band deb√ºtierte auf dem Label von Conor Oberst von der Band Bright Eyes, der Big Thief protegierte - bevor das Quartett zu 4AD wechselte und mit seinem Folkrock nicht nur Barack Obama als Fan gewinnen konnte. Mittlerweile kann die Band sogar eine Hand voller Grammy-Nominierungen vorweisen - was auch immer das wert ist.\\n\\nMit ihrem Bandkollegen Buck Meek war Lenker verheiratet, seit 2018 sind sie geschieden - was eine Probe f√ºr das Bandgef√ºge war, die die beiden aber bestanden haben. Ihre n√§chste Beziehung hatte Lenker mit einer Frau, was ihre Konfusion nicht schm√§lerte und in Themen m√ºndete, die auf \"Bright Future\" auftauchen.\\n\\nDie intimen Lieder Lenkers schlagen sich in einer ebensolchen Produktion nieder. Schon die Vorg√§nger \"Songs\" und \"Instrumentals\" waren ebenfalls in einem sehr hermetischen Rahmen w√§hrend Covid und ohne digitales Zutun entstanden. \"Bright Future\" ist nun ebenfalls ohne Bits und Bytes empfangen worden.\\n\\nDas Werk wurde in der Einschicht von Massachusetts eingespielt, in einem Studio im Wald, abseits von Bildschirmen und Smartphone-Empfang. F√ºr Lenker war das gewisserma√üen ein Schritt in die Vergangenheit, in der sie als Kind mit ihren Eltern Zeit bei den Amish verbracht hatte.\\n\\nZwar er√∂ffnet sie mit einem Lied voller Selbstzweifel, dabei klingt sie aber sehr bei sich. Das Klavier molliert, die Streicher verliert sie im Verlauf des Songs, der wird weniger statt mehr. Das countryfizierte \"Sadness as a Gift\" ist st√§rker instrumentiert, die Umgebung scheint aber dahingehend Einfluss zu nehmen, dass nie jemand zu viel spielt, lieber weniger.\\n\\nDie Umgebung wird so fast ein unsichtbares, aber sp√ºrbares Bandmitglied und macht sich als ruhige, n√§chtlich Atmosph√§re bemerkbar. Zugleich ist \"Sadness as a Gift\" der Versuch einer Umdeutung der Umst√§nde. Traurigkeit als Geschenk, als Chance, daraus wenigstens einnehmende Musik zu machen, sie so ein St√ºck weit zu √ºberwinden. Ein Titel wie \"No Machine\" ist gewisserma√üen ein Manifest bez√ºglich der Art, wie das Album produziert wurde.\\n\\nDie √Ñsthetik, die entsteht, muss man sich als Zuh√∂rer erst erarbeiten, diese Musik ist keine f√ºr zwischendurch. Sie bietet daf√ºr das Erlebnis, gewisserma√üen in der ersten Reihe beim Entstehungsprozess dabei zu sein. Sie f√ºhlt sich so nah an, als s√§√üe man neben Michelle Shocked, als diese am Lagerfeuer einst ihre \"Texas Campfire Tapes\" aufnahm.\\n\\nDas \"Schlagzeug\" sind oft nicht mehr als irgendwo dagegengetrommelte Sticks, das Album ist eine Reaktion auf das moderne Leben, auf das Lenker mit R√ºckzug reagiert. Eine Strategie, die ebenfalls schon kommerzialisiert wurde. Lenkers R√ºckzug verlangt daf√ºr aber nur den Gegenwert f√ºr ihr Album und nicht gleich tausende Euro f√ºr solch ein allumfassendes All-exclusive-Erlebnis. Aber ihr R√ºckzug ist nat√ºrlich auch nur tempor√§r: Die B√ºhne wartet.

Suu Kyi\\'s lawyers had challenged the auction order.\\n\\nThe auction was held in front of the closed gates of the lakeside property, which has served as an unofficial party headquarters and a political shrine for the country\\'s pro-democracy movement. While living there, Suu Kyi hosted visiting dignitaries including U.S. President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\\n\\nSuu Kyi, 78, is serving a 27-year prison sentence in a series of cases brought by the military, which seized power from her elected government in February 2021.

He returned to court repeatedly over the following two decades to press his claims.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court decided in August 2022, after the army seized power, to have the property sold by auction.\\n\\nThe two-story colonial-style building was given decades ago by the government to Suu Kyi\\'s mother, Khin Kyi, after her husband, independence hero Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in July 1947.\\n\\nKhin Kyi died in December 1988, shortly after the failure of a mass uprising against military rule in which Suu Kyi was a leader and co-founder of the National League for Democracy party. She was detained in 1989 ahead of a 1990 election which her party easily won but was not allowed to take power when the army annulled the results.\\n\\nShe spent almost 15 of the following 21 years under house arrest at the property. For most of the time, she was alone with just a housekeeper, and at one point had to sell some of her furniture to afford food.\\n\\nShe remained there after her 2010 release until moving in 2012 to the capital, Naypyitaw, to serve in Parliament. She became the nation\\'s leader after a 2015 general election.\\n\\nEarly this month, Suu Kyi\\'s legal team filed an appeal at Yangon Region High Court requesting that the order to sell the house be amended because Suu Kyi did not seem to know about the auction and had not been allowed to meet and give instructions to her lawyers about it.\\n\\nThe auction was also challenged by the main organization that is coordinating opposition to the military government.

Offenbart sich darin doch auch gut, wie unrealistisch die Erwartungen und wie stark der Glaube an schier magische F√§higkeiten von dem, was heutzutage als \"k√ºnstliche Intelligenz\" bezeichnet wird, mittlerweile in breiten Teilen der Bev√∂lkerung sind.\\n\\nDoch worum geht es eigentlich: Vor wenigen Tagen ist ein Video \"aufgetaucht\", das Kate Middleton gemeinsam mit ihrem Ehemann, einem gewissen William Arthur Philip Louis Mountbatten-Windsor, beim zwanglosen Einkauf zeigen soll. Dass diese Aufnahme von ziemlich √ºberschaubarer Qualit√§t ist und somit reichlich Interpretationsspielraum daf√ºr l√§sst, wer da wirklich zu sehen ist, feuerte wenig √ºberraschend die Fantasie der bereits seit Monaten ermittelnden Internetdetektive in Sachen Kate nur weiter an, wie 404Media als Erstes berichtete.\\n\\nAn dieser Stelle wird es dann aber wieder aus einer technischen Sicht interessant: Im Bestreben, sich Klarheit √ºber die zu sehenden Personen zu verschaffen, greifen viele davon zu Bild-KI-Tools, die versprechen, das zu tun, was Serien wie \"CSI: Cyber\" vor einigen Jahren noch zum Spott jeder technisch halbwegs informierten Person gemacht haben: die Verbesserung von Bildern mit niedriger Aufl√∂sung, um damit erkennen zu k√∂nnen, wer sich dahinter wirklich verbirgt.\\n\\nDass diese Ergebnisse dann durchaus ernsthaft und ziemlich aufgeregt in sozialen Medien diskutiert und analysiert werden, zeigt ein grundlegendes Missverst√§ndnis dieser Tools. Solche Ergebnisse sind purer Unsinn, sie m√∂gen detaillierter aussehen als das Original, die hinzugef√ºgten Informationen sind aber mehr oder weniger gut geraten.\\n\\nDer Grund liegt darin, wie solche Techniken aus dem Bereich des Maschinenlernens funktionieren: Die genutzten neuronalen Netze werden auf eine Unzahl von Bildern trainiert, um darin Muster zu erkennen. Fordert man nun so ein Tool dazu auf, ein verpixeltes Foto zu \"verbessern\", werden einfach die statistisch wahrscheinlichsten Pixel an jeder Stelle verwendet. Das kann f√ºr eine leichte Verbesserung von Bildern mit ausreichend vorhandenen Details noch ganz gut funktionieren, bei unklaren Aufnahmen geht es dann aber schnell in den Bereich der Fiktion.\\n\\nAll das sind auch keine neuen Erkenntnisse, bereits vor einigen Jahren sind die ersten Entpixelungs-Tools aufgetaucht und haben umgehend f√ºr Diskussionen √ºber die Nutzung solcher Technologien gesorgt. Reproduzieren sie doch damit einfach das, worauf sie trainiert wurden, und damit auch s√§mtliche Vorurteile im Ausgangsmaterial.\\n\\nBesonders eindr√ºcklich war dabei das Beispiel eines Portr√§tfotos des ehemaligen US-Pr√§sidenten Barack Obama. Zun√§chst verpixel und dann durch so ein KI-System geschickt, wurde daraus ein wei√üer Mann. W√ºrde man das Originalbild nicht kennen, k√∂nnte man das Ergebnis des Tools f√ºr beeindruckend halten, in Wirklichkeit ist es aber nat√ºrlich Fiktion.\\n\\nAnders gesagt: Wer auf diesen Bildern zu sehen ist, m√ºssen sich die Fans der royalen R√§tselrallye schon auf anderem Weg zusammenreimen - von der Frage, ob das √ºberhaupt eine gute Idee ist, mal ganz abgesehen. Das Hochrechnen von Bildern mit KI wird jedenfalls bei der Kl√§rung dieser Frage keine Hilfe sein.

After appreciating more than 12.80% in 2023 and closing below 17.00 pesos per dollar, political events of utmost importance on both sides of the Rio Grande may generate volatility and uncertainty in USD/MXN.\\n\\nThis year there are elections in Mexico and the United States, a fact that has not happened since 2012, when Enrique Pe√±a Nieto won the Presidency of Mexico and Barack Obama secured a second term in the White House.\\n\\nIn Mexico, a historic scenario is presented: the possibility that, for the first time in history, a woman will be the head of the executive branch. Leading the polls is Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate of the Sigamos haciendo historia coalition, followed by X√≥chitl G√°lvez, candidate of the Fuerza y Coraz√≥n por M√©xico coalition. In a distant third place is the candidate of the Movimiento Ciudadano, Jorge √Ålvarez M√°ynez.\\n\\nIn election years, the Mexican peso tends to depreciate regardless of which party wins the election. The main cause is linked to political instability, due to the election results and the reaction(s) of the losing political parties.\\n\\nIn 2006 - in the election of Felipe Calder√≥n during the first half of the year - the Mexican peso depreciated -6.58%, closing the year with a loss of -1.58%. In the election of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, in 2012, it appreciated 3.34% in the first six months, ending the year at 12.85, down from 13.93% at the end of 2011, with an appreciation of 7.77%. And finally, in 2018 - in the election of Andr√©s L√≥pez Obrador - it appreciated 1.80%, closing virtually unchanged at 19.6504.\\n\\nOn the other side of the border, the president of the United States -Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate- and Donald Trump, on the part of the Republicans, are shaping up for a second confrontation.\\n\\nDuring the 2016 election, when Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the U.S. dollar appreciated 20.45% against the Mexican peso, which plummeted due to the political risks posed by the election of President Trump. During his campaign, Trump focused his attacks on Mexico and the construction of a border wall. However, in the last election in 2020, the Mexican peso depreciated moderately by 5.22%, in the face of Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe fact that there is no counterweight in Mexico, given the scenario that the presidency and the majority of Congress are concentrated in a single political party, further weakens the institutional framework in the country. The involvement of the executive branch in the election can generate a climate of political instability and uncertainty, which can also create volatility in the USD/MXN.\\n\\nIn the United States, Donald Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric may increase as the November election approaches. However, it is not a fact that takes the markets by surprise, given the precedent of his presidency from 2016 to 2020, where the free trade agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada, known as the USMCA, was signed.\\n\\nDespite these factors, the main trigger for the positive behavior of the USD/MXN exchange rate is the monetary policy established by the Bank of Mexico - better known as Banxico. Faced with the scenario of a post-Covid-19 pandemic economic recovery, the central institute took forecasts of a possible uptick in inflation and began increases in the reference rate.\\n\\nBanxico began its tightening monetary policy cycle before the U.S. Federal Reserve and raised rates aggressively. As a result, the interest rate differential between the two countries increased to 6%, favoring the attraction of capital to Mexico. This implied a greater supply of dollars, so the Mexican peso appreciated.\\n\\nAs a result of these measures, inflation has moderated globally. Both Banxico and the Federal Reserve have begun discussing possible adjustments to their monetary policy. The Bank of Mexico has signaled that it could start cutting the benchmark rate in March, while the Fed is cautious. Based on the Chicago futures market, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates through June. In this scenario, the Mexican peso would depreciate due to a reduction in interest rate differentials.\\n\\nTaking these factors into account, a negative market sentiment influenced by geopolitical factors and a possible economic slowdown on both sides of the border could affect the Mexican currency. Therefore, and based on projections of the last five elections in Mexico, it is estimated that the exchange rate throughout the year will fluctuate between 16.76 and 18.46 pesos per dollar.\\n\\nFacing these scenarios, it is good to remember that with XM it is possible to trade in the Forex market, as well as with other instruments.

Weiss and Alexander Woo discuss their latest fantastical epic, the alien space saga \"3 Body Problem\" for Netflix.\\n\\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were finishing off their hit HBO series after an eight-season run and wondering what was next. That was when the Netflix executive Peter Friedlander approached them with a trilogy of science-fiction books by the Chinese novelist Liu Cixin called \"Remembrance of Earth\\'s Past.\"\\n\\n\"We knew that it won the Hugo Award, which is a big deal for us since we grew up as nerds,\" Benioff said of the literary prize for science fiction. Barack Obama was also on record as a fan.\\n\\nBenioff and Weiss dipped in and were intrigued by what they found: a sweeping space invasion saga that begins in 1960s China, amid the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, and involves a superior alien race that has built a rabid cultlike following on Earth. A heady mix of science and skulduggery, featuring investigations both scientific and criminal, it felt utterly unique. \"So much content right now feels like, \\'Oh, here\\'s another forensic show, here\\'s another legal thriller,\\' it just feels like it\\'s a version of something you\\'ve seen,\" Benioff said. \"This universe is a different one.\"\\n\\nOr, as Weiss added, \"This is the universe.\"\\n\\nThose novels are now the core of \"3 Body Problem,\" a new series that Benioff and Weiss created with Alexander Woo (\"True Blood\"). It premiered on opening night at the South by Southwest Film Festival and arrives Thursday on Netflix. The setting has changed along the way, with most of the action unfolding in London rather than China (although the Cultural Revolution is still a key element), and the characters, most of them young and pretty, now represent several countries. But the central themes remain the same: belief, fear, discovery and an Earth imperiled by superior beings. Among the heroes are the gruff intelligence chief Thomas Wade, played by the \"Thrones\" veteran Liam Cunningham, and a team of five young, reluctant, Oxford-trained physicists played by John Bradley -- another \"Thrones\" star -- Jovan Adepo, Eiza Gonz√°les, Jess Hong and Alex Sharp. Can they save the world for their descendants?\\n\\nIn an interview in Austin the day of the SXSW premiere, the series creators discussed life after \"Thrones,\" their personal ties to \"3 Body Problem\" and the trick to making physics sexy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\\n\\nThe series is quite different from the books, particularly the settings and characters, both of which are a lot less Chinese.

Offenbart sich darin doch auch gut, wie unrealistisch die Erwartungen und wie stark der Glaube an schier magische F√§higkeiten von dem, was heutzutage als \"k√ºnstliche Intelligenz\" bezeichnet wird, mittlerweile in breiten Teilen der Bev√∂lkerung sind.\\n\\nDoch worum geht es eigentlich: Vor wenigen Tagen ist ein Video \"aufgetaucht\", das Kate Middleton gemeinsam mit ihrem Ehemann, einem gewissen William Arthur Philip Louis Mountbatten-Windsor, beim zwanglosen Einkauf zeigen soll. Dass diese Aufnahme von ziemlich √ºberschaubarer Qualit√§t ist und somit reichlich Interpretationsspielraum daf√ºr l√§sst, wer da wirklich zu sehen ist, feuerte wenig √ºberraschend die Fantasie der bereits seit Monaten ermittelnden Internetdetektive in Sachen Kate nur weiter an, wie 404Media als Erstes berichtete.\\n\\nAn dieser Stelle wird es dann aber wieder aus einer technischen Sicht interessant: Im Bestreben, sich Klarheit √ºber die zu sehenden Personen zu verschaffen, greifen viele davon zu Bild-KI-Tools, die versprechen, das zu tun, was Serien wie \"CSI: Cyber\" vor einigen Jahren noch zum Spott jeder technisch halbwegs informierten Person gemacht haben: die Verbesserung von Bildern mit niedriger Aufl√∂sung, um damit erkennen zu k√∂nnen, wer sich dahinter wirklich verbirgt.\\n\\nDass diese Ergebnisse dann durchaus ernsthaft und ziemlich aufgeregt in sozialen Medien diskutiert und analysiert werden, zeigt ein grundlegendes Missverst√§ndnis dieser Tools. Solche Ergebnisse sind purer Unsinn, sie m√∂gen detaillierter aussehen als das Original, die hinzugef√ºgten Informationen sind aber mehr oder weniger gut geraten.\\n\\nDer Grund liegt darin, wie solche Techniken aus dem Bereich des Maschinenlernens funktionieren: Die genutzten neuronalen Netze werden auf eine Unzahl von Bildern trainiert, um darin Muster zu erkennen. Fordert man nun so ein Tool dazu auf, ein verpixeltes Foto zu \"verbessern\", werden einfach die statistisch wahrscheinlichsten Pixel an jeder Stelle verwendet. Das kann f√ºr eine leichte Verbesserung von Bildern mit ausreichend vorhandenen Details noch ganz gut funktionieren, bei unklaren Aufnahmen geht es dann aber schnell in den Bereich der Fiktion.\\n\\nAll das sind auch keine neuen Erkenntnisse, bereits vor einigen Jahren sind die ersten Entpixelungs-Tools aufgetaucht und haben umgehend f√ºr Diskussionen √ºber die Nutzung solcher Technologien gesorgt. Reproduzieren sie doch damit einfach das, worauf sie trainiert wurden, und damit auch s√§mtliche Vorurteile im Ausgangsmaterial.\\n\\nBesonders eindr√ºcklich war dabei das Beispiel eines Portr√§tfotos des ehemaligen US-Pr√§sidenten Barack Obama. Zun√§chst verpixel und dann durch so ein KI-System geschickt, wurde daraus ein wei√üer Mann. W√ºrde man das Originalbild nicht kennen, k√∂nnte man das Ergebnis des Tools f√ºr beeindruckend halten, in Wirklichkeit ist es aber nat√ºrlich Fiktion.\\n\\nAnders gesagt: Wer auf diesen Bildern zu sehen ist, m√ºssen sich die Fans der royalen R√§tselrallye schon auf anderem Weg zusammenreimen - von der Frage, ob das √ºberhaupt eine gute Idee ist, mal ganz abgesehen. Das Hochrechnen von Bildern mit KI wird jedenfalls bei der Kl√§rung dieser Frage keine Hilfe sein.

Von wegen \"Country roads / take me home / to the place / I belong\". Das war ein Heile-Welt-Schlager f√ºr Bleif√º√üe auf dem Weg heim zur Mutti. Was aber, wenn der \"place I belong\" noch nicht gefunden wurde? Adrianne Lenker ist eine, die diesen Platz noch sucht. Dabei tr√§gt sie ihre Vergangenheit wie einen Rucksack voller Steine mit sich.\\n\\nLenker ist 32 und steht im Hauptberuf der Band Big Thief vor. Das ist eine US-amerikanische Folkrock-Band, was auf ihrem Label auff√§llt wie ein rotumrandeter Eiterpickel auf der Nasenspitze. Das Label ist britisch und hei√üt 4AD und ist f√ºr seine Pr√§senz im Countryrock eher nicht so bekannt, sieht man von der Formation Tarnation ab, die seinerzeit eine Art David-Lynch-dreht-einen-Spaghetti-Western-Musik gespielt hat.\\n\\nAdrianne Lenker hat nun ein neues Soloalbum aufgenommen, ihr f√ºnftes, und es wird am Freitag ver√∂ffentlicht. Es tr√§gt den hoffnungsfrohen Titel \"Bright Future\". Lenker hat in der Musik fr√ºh ein Ventil gefunden. Sie war noch keine zehn Jahre alt, als sie ihre ersten Songs schrieb, und gerade 15, als ihr erstes Album ver√∂ffentlicht wurde. Schon damals trug sie eher schwer.\\n\\nLenker wurde in eine religi√∂se, noch sehr junge Familie hineingeboren und erlebte die Sinnsuche ihrer Eltern in diversen Fundi-Sekten - inklusive Entsagungen und anschlie√üender reum√ºtiger Wiedereingemeindungen. Genug Stoff, um einen ordentlichen Schaden aufgeladen zu bekommen. Mit Big Thief schuf sie sich einen Ausweg.\\n\\nDie Band deb√ºtierte auf dem Label von Conor Oberst von der Band Bright Eyes, der Big Thief protegierte - bevor das Quartett zu 4AD wechselte und mit seinem Folkrock nicht nur Barack Obama als Fan gewinnen konnte. Mittlerweile kann die Band sogar eine Hand voller Grammy-Nominierungen vorweisen - was auch immer das wert ist.\\n\\nMit ihrem Bandkollegen Buck Meek war Lenker verheiratet, seit 2018 sind sie geschieden - was eine Probe f√ºr das Bandgef√ºge war, die die beiden aber bestanden haben. Ihre n√§chste Beziehung hatte Lenker mit einer Frau, was ihre Konfusion nicht schm√§lerte und in Themen m√ºndete, die auf \"Bright Future\" auftauchen.\\n\\nDie intimen Lieder Lenkers schlagen sich in einer ebensolchen Produktion nieder. Schon die Vorg√§nger \"Songs\" und \"Instrumentals\" waren ebenfalls in einem sehr hermetischen Rahmen w√§hrend Covid und ohne digitales Zutun entstanden. \"Bright Future\" ist nun ebenfalls ohne Bits und Bytes empfangen worden.\\n\\nDas Werk wurde in der Einschicht von Massachusetts eingespielt, in einem Studio im Wald, abseits von Bildschirmen und Smartphone-Empfang. F√ºr Lenker war das gewisserma√üen ein Schritt in die Vergangenheit, in der sie als Kind mit ihren Eltern Zeit bei den Amish verbracht hatte.\\n\\nZwar er√∂ffnet sie mit einem Lied voller Selbstzweifel, dabei klingt sie aber sehr bei sich. Das Klavier molliert, die Streicher verliert sie im Verlauf des Songs, der wird weniger statt mehr. Das countryfizierte \"Sadness as a Gift\" ist st√§rker instrumentiert, die Umgebung scheint aber dahingehend Einfluss zu nehmen, dass nie jemand zu viel spielt, lieber weniger.\\n\\nDie Umgebung wird so fast ein unsichtbares, aber sp√ºrbares Bandmitglied und macht sich als ruhige, n√§chtlich Atmosph√§re bemerkbar. Zugleich ist \"Sadness as a Gift\" der Versuch einer Umdeutung der Umst√§nde. Traurigkeit als Geschenk, als Chance, daraus wenigstens einnehmende Musik zu machen, sie so ein St√ºck weit zu √ºberwinden. Ein Titel wie \"No Machine\" ist gewisserma√üen ein Manifest bez√ºglich der Art, wie das Album produziert wurde.\\n\\nDie √Ñsthetik, die entsteht, muss man sich als Zuh√∂rer erst erarbeiten, diese Musik ist keine f√ºr zwischendurch. Sie bietet daf√ºr das Erlebnis, gewisserma√üen in der ersten Reihe beim Entstehungsprozess dabei zu sein. Sie f√ºhlt sich so nah an, als s√§√üe man neben Michelle Shocked, als diese am Lagerfeuer einst ihre \"Texas Campfire Tapes\" aufnahm.\\n\\nDas \"Schlagzeug\" sind oft nicht mehr als irgendwo dagegengetrommelte Sticks, das Album ist eine Reaktion auf das moderne Leben, auf das Lenker mit R√ºckzug reagiert. Eine Strategie, die ebenfalls schon kommerzialisiert wurde. Lenkers R√ºckzug verlangt daf√ºr aber nur den Gegenwert f√ºr ihr Album und nicht gleich tausende Euro f√ºr solch ein allumfassendes All-exclusive-Erlebnis. Aber ihr R√ºckzug ist nat√ºrlich auch nur tempor√§r: Die B√ºhne wartet.

As a student interested in preventive medicine, I wish to share an insight on vaccination. In the case of Paul Alexander, who recently died after surviving 72 years in an iron lung as an unvaccinated polio victim, I was struck by how much human suffering could have been avoided by the simple act of vaccination. Despite his paralysis, he obtained a law degree, wrote a memoir and became a TikTok sensation. How much more would the world could have benefited had he been vaccinated? How much suffering would have been prevented? Like the archaic iron lung, vaccine-preventable illnesses should remain relics of a past age. He left an important message for today\\'s parents. Vaccines save lives.\\n\\nStephanie Oehler, Tampa\\n\\nReagan would never cast a vote for Trump | Column, March 19\\n\\nI agree with the writer, the former secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan, that the Gipper would never vote for Donald Trump. But when he adds that he himself will not vote for Trump or Joe Biden, I would inform him that a vote for the No Labels candidate would, in fact, effectively be a vote for Donald Trump.\\n\\nDavid Burg, Tampa\\n\\nIf DeSantis signs chaplain bill, Nevada Hindu eager to volunteer | March 17\\n\\nThis story says that \"Lawmakers who support the bill ... argue that volunteer chaplains will help the shortage of mental health counselors in schools.\" Are these the same legislators who fear the grooming and indoctrination of children in schools? Will they set a curriculum for what these chaplains are allowed to talk about? They have no problem with a lay person filling in for a professional counselor. How\\'s about diverting some of the millions of dollars they allocated to the school voucher program to hiring professional counselors who are trained in mental health issues?\\n\\nSharon Smith, Land O\\' Lakes\\n\\nWhat a doctor sees when Biden hesitates | Column, March 12\\n\\nI am neither a psychiatrist nor a neurologist. However, I have worked with psychiatrists and neurologists, and I have sat through team meetings to come up with care plans for their patients with dementia. I also had the personal experience of my grandmother disappearing into Alzheimer\\'s beginning in in her 60s and her husband who aged normally and died at 94. From what I can see, former President Donald Trump is following the path of my grandmother and President Joe Biden is aging normally like my grandfather.\\n\\nSymptomatically, nothing that Biden exhibits looks like anything but the normal aging of an 80-year-old man. His age is a valid concern considering the heavy responsibilities of office, but it isn\\'t his mental acuity that is the problem.\\n\\nTrump does pretty well as long as he is reading the teleprompter and sticks to the script, but when he wanders off into ad-libbing, he creates word salads and when compounded with his tendency to fabricate things that are not true he becomes disassociated from reality. Trump\\'s speech problems look to me like schizophasia, glossomania and receptive aphasia. These can be evidence of actual dementia.\\n\\nThe media should be doing some investigative work to tell the public why Trump\\'s speech is so meandering, confused and often incoherent, considering how much time they spend on Biden\\'s gait, gaffes and word choice since they are unlikely to signify a serious mental disability like dementia.\\n\\nIn response to this letter, I wonder why the writer is not addressing the same sort of remarks against former President Donald Trump? Trump has been confused about the fact that he is running against President Joe Biden and not Barack Obama; he has confused Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi; and at one point at a recent rally and reading from a teleprompter Trump became so confused he simply stopped speaking and let out a frustrated \"Arrrggg!\" These are just a few of Trump\\'s mishaps. It is very common for older people to lose their balance and fall but has nothing to do with their cognitive abilities. I will vote for Biden even at 81 years of age over Trump\\'s insanity any day. At least I know Biden will surround himself with good competent people and not those who are loyal only to Trump and not our Constitution or to the United States and its people.\\n\\nBetty \"Bea\" Dreier, Tampa\\n\\nCease-fire talks with Israel, Hamas expected to resume today | March 17\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden should make a public proposal for ending the conflict. Propose that Hamas release all the hostages and Israel agree to a three-month cease-fire while permanent terms are agreed upon. I believe the Israeli public will demand their government accept the terms. If Hamas cares that their population is starving, they will accept it too. If they don\\'t care what happens to their civilian population, the onus will be on them.\\n\\nI must caution the letter writer not to proceed with his plan to approach the honking driver behind him at the stop light, purportedly to discuss intersection fatalities with him/her caused by red light runners, lest he himself be shot dead. Here in Florida, he could legally meet his demise in explaining why he hesitates for a few seconds after the light turns green, if an armed driver views his advances as threatening. His good intentions -- and his life -- could be wasted needlessly.\\n\\nRecently at the grocery store I was talking to the customer in front of me whose brother had lost both of his legs in Vietnam about how the country has changed from the one he had served and in so doing, had given up his ability to ever walk again. Though we were not holding up the line and only talking while our very expensive items were being rung up, the woman behind me said, \"This isn\\'t the time and place for that.\" I turned around and told her that I will decide when it\\'s the time and place. I said that although some people may want the government to try to take away our First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, we still have those rights. She gave me a very angry look but didn\\'t say another word. Now is the time more than ever before to stand up to the bullies who will not stop until all of our freedoms are gone.\\n\\nThe National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The bill would make every person\\'s vote equal throughout the United States. It would ensure that every vote, in every state, will matter in every presidential election. We should elect the president by a vote of the people in all 50 states, and the winner should be whoever wins the most votes. Please back a national popular vote bill in Florida and in every state.

I don\\'t mean in general staring off into space or watching the clouds in your coffee kind of stuff, I mean when you see something so extraordinarily evil that you\\'re left speechless.\\n\\nThat happened to me last week when I saw the video of a white female student being brutally beaten by a black female student in Missouri. As you\\'ve no doubt seen, the black girl beats the white girl into unconsciousness and repeatedly slams her head into the concrete. The victim went into convulsions and, as of this writing, is in critical condition in the hospital.\\n\\nThere are two primary questions I had after watching this video. The first was why does no one try and stop the attacker when there are a dozen people around the fight, including at least one person recording a video? The second was what kind of an upbringing make them act this way? These two unanswerable questions melded into a third, which was, why do we see so many videos of blacks acting violently? Beating white people. Beating other black people. Attacking restaurant employees. Attacking cops. Pushing people in front of subway trains. And the list goes on. And on. And on.\\n\\nOn the day I saw this video, I happened to be reading a book called Empire by Niall Ferguson. I was at the point where he compared the actions of the British -- which is the empire to which the title refers -- and the Japanese in their early 20th-century empire. In particular, he discusses the Rape of Nanking, one of the most brutal and disgusting displays of savagery ever chronicled.\\n\\nFerguson doesn\\'t pretend the British were never brutal. In fact, they were and he discusses it. But he makes the distinction between the British killing opponents during battles -- sometimes including unarmed women and children who were peacefully protesting -- or the deaths of prisoners from incompetent logistics management and the Japanese brutal, intentional infliction of pain and torture on civilians and POWs alike. There were literally contests to see who could kill more people or do so more quickly or brutally.\\n\\nSuch abuse was never limited to the Japanese, of course. The Germans were equally as evil during WWII. Like the Japanese, their killing beyond the battlefield was often a mix of cruelty, sadism, depravity, and systemized murder. Such evil has been endemic throughout much of human history.\\n\\nOne of the reasons the Spanish were able to so easily subdue the great Aztec empire was because so many of its neighbors were enthusiastic about ridding themselves of the cruel, murderous empire where captured enemies would frequently die horrifying, brutal deaths. More recently, the Rwandan genocide, ISIS\\'s brutality, the execution of thousands of Nigerian Christians by Muslims, and Hamas\\'s October 7th attacks demonstrate that man can be a savage instrument of evil.\\n\\nSince the moment Cain slew Abel, history is full of violence. But what we\\'re seeing among many American blacks seems to be different. Not different in that it\\'s unique in history, but that it\\'s unique in American history. What I mean by that is that it\\'s a perfect storm of Democrat malevolence.\\n\\nThat storm has three components. The first is what seems to have become the primary plank of the Democrat party; namely, alleged white racism. Before Barack Obama, America\\'s race relations had been largely improving for 40 years. With his \"the police acted stupidly\" comment, things got off on the wrong foot, and after the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, things went south quickly.\\n\\nThen, George Floyd\\'s death in 2020 sent race relations into a tailspin. With the riots and the shilling for BLM by everyone from the NFL to Microsoft to congressional Democrats, things took a decidedly bad turn. Suddenly, we were told systemic racism was to be found everywhere, from law enforcement to math to punctuality to proper English.\\n\\nAt the same time, we had the Pentagon, the White House, and practically every news organization in the country telling us that white nationalism is the single biggest threat to the country and that blacks were in constant danger. The left has done to whites what the Nazis did to the Jews, what the Japanese did to the Chinese, and what the Hutu did to the Tutsi... dehumanize them, make them into the Other, the ones towards whom no humanity need be shown. Once that mindset is absorbed, there are no limitations on what can be done to members of the target group.\\n\\nThe second component is that black Americans have been told by Democrats that they cannot succeed. Regardless of what they do, they are incapable of success in America because of white oppression. As such, the rules need to be changed for them -- most critically, the elimination of consequences for crimes. Essentially, the argument is that given that blacks cannot find success when they behave properly, society can\\'t punish them for behaving improperly.\\n\\nThe third component is the collapse of the black family. Today, more than 70% of black babies are born to unwed mothers. That leaves a single mother, often on welfare, to raise the children. And children in fatherless homes are far more likely to be criminals.\\n\\nThe outcome of this perfect storm is that a significant proportion of the black population hates white people, has little belief that blacks have a vested interest in civilized society, and comes from homes in which no one teaches them right from wrong. With little reason to have self-respect and even less reason to respect others, too many black Americans are simply acting out as a child would, with no filters, no self-control, no empathy, and no real remorse. That\\'s a recipe for disaster for society.\\n\\nIf America is coming apart at the seams, it\\'s not because of any \"systemic racism\" but, rather, because Democrats have seen fit to weaponize blacks, and not just against whites, but against the very fabric of America. This plays itself out in major cities across the country where most black Americans live and dominate politics.\\n\\nIndeed, black mayors (most of whom are Democrats) run almost every one of America\\'s largest and most important cities, Washington DC, Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, Baltimore, Kansas City, Milwaukee, and New Orleans among others. Virtually every one of them is like living in a relative war zone compared to much of the rest of the country. The ironic thing about all of this is that the biggest victims of this black despondency and disconnection from civilized society are fellow blacks because the animating factors of alienation and desolation know no bounds, color or otherwise.\\n\\nThis is not a sustainable model. A nation divided by race cannot survive. Americans fought a war (started by Democrats) and then passed civil rights laws a century later (which Democrats opposed) to stop systematized racial divisions. But here we are with a significant portion of America\\'s population looking into life\\'s kaleidoscope and seeing nothing but a fatalistic cacophony where they have no agency, nothing matters, and, thus, nothing has any value, including their lives and those of others.\\n\\nWhat we saw in that video is the epitome of the race war Charles Manson tried to launch. He failed then, but, sadly for Americans of all hues, half a century later, the Democrats are making his dream a reality.', 'source': {'uri': 'americanthinker.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'American Thinker'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2024-03/252923_1_.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.4588235294117647, 'wgt': 448621029, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Sherrod Brown, CNN projects - Boston News, Weather, Sports | WHDH 7News\", 'body': '(CNN) -- Bernie Moreno will win the Republican Senate primary in Ohio, CNN projects, a victory for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who had endorsed the Cleveland businessman in the three-way contest.\\n\\nMoreno will next take on Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in a fall election that will be crucial to deciding Senate control. As one of two Senate Democrats running for reelection in a state Trump twice carried, Brown is a top target for Republicans looking to pick up the one or two seats they need to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House.\\n\\n\"I want to thank President Trump for all he did for me, for this campaign, for his unwavering support, for his love of this country,\" Moreno said at his campaign\\'s watch party in Cleveland shortly after he was projected the winner.\\n\\nTuesday\\'s GOP primary was this year\\'s first test of Trump\\'s clout in a contested Senate race. The former president backed Moreno in December at the urging of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, but his stamp of approval didn\\'t initially lock things up for Moreno in what became one of the most expensive races of the cycle so far. Trump made a last-minute trip to the state over the weekend to help his preferred candidate get over the finish line.\\n\\nMoreno\\'s win is also a victory of sorts for Democrats, whose spending in the race suggested they viewed him as the weakest candidate against Brown. An outside group affiliated with Senate Democrats\\' top super PAC ran ads propping him up over state Sen. Matt Dolan and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. \"In Washington, Bernie Moreno would do Donald Trump\\'s bidding,\" the ad said, touting the candidate as a \"MAGA Republican\" who is \"too conservative for Ohio.\"\\n\\nMoreno dismissed Democrats\\' attempts to tie him to Trump and sought instead to link Brown to President Joe Biden.\\n\\n\"Let me just say something, I wear with honor my endorsement ... from President Trump. I wear that with a badge of honor,\" the candidate said. \"I will predict this: If Joe Biden enters Ohio, Sherrod Brown is gonna fly out of here like a scared cat.\"\\n\\nBrown, who was unopposed in his primary Tuesday as he bids for a fourth term in a state that\\'s been trending red, was quick to paint a contrast with his rival.\\n\\n\"The choice ahead of Ohio is clear: Bernie Moreno has spent his career and campaign putting himself first and would do the same if elected,\" the senator said in a statement.\\n\\n\"Elections come down to whose side you\\'re on, and I\\'ll always work for Ohio,\" Brown added.\\n\\nThe power of the Trump endorsement\\n\\nTrump\\'s involvement in this race was noteworthy since national Republicans - who decided to get involved in primaries this year, in part to counter the kinds of candidates who emerged as flawed general election nominees in 2022 - stayed out of this primary. The conservative Club for Growth also supported Moreno, who was born in Colombia and made a fortune from car dealerships.\\n\\nMontana Sen. Steve Daines, the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, praised Moreno after his victory and offered his \"full endorsement.\"\\n\\nDolan, the other self-funding candidate in the race who finished third in the 2022 primary won by Vance, had the support of two prominent Ohio Republicans -- Gov. Mike DeWine and former US Sen. Rob Portman -- whose engagement underscored the split in the party between its Trumpian and more establishment wings.\\n\\nDolan, who was the only one of the three candidates who did not endorse Trump, argued that he was the more electable Republican because he could outperform Trump in the suburbs.\\n\\nAt Trump\\'s weekend rally, which was largely overshadowed by his controversial rhetoric about a \"bloodbath\" for the auto industry, the former president attacked Dolan as a RINO, or \"Republican in Name Only,\" and praised Moreno as a \"political outsider.\"\\n\\nMoreno leaned heavily into his backing from Trump, with the former president omnipresent in his campaign\\'s advertising. \"MAGA alert: President Trump wants you to vote for outsider businessman Bernie Moreno,\" said one of the campaign\\'s final ads, which reminded voters just tuning in who had the most coveted endorsement in Republican primaries. \"Trump endorsed Bernie Moreno for Senate.\"\\n\\nMoreno faced attacks from his opponents and their allies for previously holding more moderate policy positions. As CNN\\'s KFile reported earlier this year, he once said there was \"no scenario\" in which he would support Trump and called him a \"fake Republican.\"\\n\\nBut like Vance, who made it through the 2022 primary with the help of Trump, Moreno was able to weaponize his backing from the former president to quell any skepticism about his previous loyalty.\\n\\nThe willingness of Moreno and Dolan to pour millions of their own money into their campaigns put spending for this race at over $40 million as of Monday. Ohio\\'s Senate race trails only the US presidential race, the 2023 Kentucky governor\\'s race and California\\'s 2024 Senate race in total ad spending so far, excluding future reservations.\\n\\nMoreno said Tuesday that he had spoken with Dolan, who had congratulated him on the race, while LaRose released a statement saying he had done the same.\\n\\n\"Now is the time to stand together as a party,\" LaRose said. \"We all share the same mission to retire Sherrod Brown and restore Ohio\\'s voice and values to the United States Senate. The stakes for this election couldn\\'t be higher.\"\\n\\nOne of this fall\\'s top Senate races\\n\\nBrown, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006 after seven terms in the US House, will face off against Moreno in a state that twice voted for Barack Obama before swinging to Trump in the next two presidential contests. The senator, who\\'s known as a progressive populist, is the last remaining Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office in the Buckeye State. He won his last race, against a weak challenger without national GOP backing, by 7 points in 2018.\\n\\nBrown acknowledged Monday that this may be the most challenging contest of his career. \"Sure,\" the third-term incumbent told reporters in Dayton, \"it may be my toughest race.\"\\n\\nThe senator ended the pre-primary reporting period on February 28 with a cash-on-hand advantage - $13.5 million to Moreno\\'s $2.4 million. But if the primary is any indication, Moreno would be willing to pour his own resources into the race.\\n\\nThe outside money already laid down in Ohio shows just how competitive both parties are expecting it to be. Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC tied to Democratic leadership, has reserved $65 million for TV ads - by far the most of any of the seven states where it made early reservations. On the Republican side, Senate Leadership Fund and an affiliated group have booked about $80 million.\\n\\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

Fauci, in a Saturday evening conversation titled \"For the Greater Good,\" told a Richmond Forum audience that this condition is hazardous to our nation\\'s health.\\n\\n\"We\\'re living in an era now, like it or not, where we have the normalization of untruths. Where there\\'s so much misinformation and disinformation out there that the general public understandably but tragically shrugs their shoulders and say, \\'You know, we don\\'t know what\\'s true,\\'\" he said. \"And when nothing is true and facts mean nothing, that\\'s the first step toward the dissolution of our democracy.\"\\n\\nPeople are also reading...

Despite five decades of public service combating public health emergencies, he has been vilified to the point of receiving death threats. This vitriol reinforces the notion that the pandemic triggered a mental health crisis or resurfaced latent viciousness embedded in the national psyche.\\n\\nDuring his brief speech and much longer Q&A with Dr. Danny Avula, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Social Services, Fauci -- who has advised seven U.S. presidents -- stressed that he is apolitical and nonpartisan.\\n\\nThen-President Ronald Reagan, in the early years of his administration, \"probably could have done much more to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to galvanize the public about the threat of this emerging pandemic,\" he said. Instead, Reagan \"didn\\'t mention the word AIDS until his second term.\"\\n\\nIn contrast, he praised the compassion of then-President George W. Bush, whose billions of dollars of assistance to AIDS-ravaged Africa saved millions of lives, Fauci said. \"That tells you what the leadership of a president can do.\"\\n\\nHe amused the audience in describing a weary then-President Barack Obama -- amid outbreaks of an earlier flu pandemic and the Ebola and Zika viruses -- saying, \"Tony, you know I\\'ve got ISIS, I\\'ve got children at the border ... and you\\'re giving me all these diseases. Enough is enough.\"\\n\\n\"And we all know about COVID and President Trump,\" Fauci said dryly and succinctly.\\n\\nA mentor advised him long ago that each time he walked into the White House might be his last \"because I might have to tell the president or the people around him or her an inconvenient truth.\"\\n\\nFor Fauci, 83, the truth has become inconvenient to his numerous detractors.\\n\\nWilliams: Can the Blue Zones Project cure what ails Hopewell?\\n\\nHe recalled demonstrations by gay activists during the early years of HIV in his roles as the National Institute of Health\\'s AIDS coordinator, prior to being appointed as the first director of the NIH\\'s Office of AIDS Research.\\n\\nBut Fauci, a Brooklyn native, noted that he \"never for a moment felt unsafe going into Greenwich Village, into the gay and lesbian community center alone with a hundred hurting, angry, fearful gay activists, because I knew they knew I was trying to help them,\" he said.\\n\\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\\n\\n\"Fast forward to the COVID years, when the amount of conspiracy theories, ad hominem attacks, making up things about me that if they weren\\'t so crazy, they would be ludicrous, there\\'s a big, big difference.\"\\n\\nFauci\\'s talk focused a good deal on the ill health of our discourse and democracy. The talk, at times, brought to mind an image of him pressing a stethoscope against our body politic and frowning at what he hears.\\n\\nOr as he said: \"A catastrophic event like an outbreak shines a bright spotlight on some of the weaknesses in our society.\"\\n\\nIndeed, what he describes as our \"period of profound divisiveness,\" beyond making Fauci a target, hindered a coordinated public health response. As a result, 1.17 million people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S., a per-capita death rate worse than almost every other country in the world.\\n\\nIt\\'d be silly of us to think that public health is the only aspect of American life imperiled by this divide, which has gone beyond healthy difference and debate toward irrational self-destruction.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen what it did in the middle of a historic health crisis. So that could be kind of the metaphor of what could happen in other areas of our society,\" Fauci said, adding: \"We can\\'t have a viable society when we don\\'t even talk to each other.\"\\n\\nWilliams: Who\\'s to stop the next insurrection?\\n\\nThe virus shined a spotlight on our society\\'s inequities, including access to health care and the foods and diets that promote healthy outcomes and prevent obesity, diabetes and hypertension, he said.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it\\'s difficult if not impossible to have a rational conversation about equity, which the political right has reduced to a four-letter word.\\n\\nBut inequity continues to ail and kill us. The worst of the pandemic is behind us. But last Friday, there were 432,000 new COVID infections in the U.S., Fauci said.\\n\\nHe was circumspect about the origins of COVID-19. He did not rule out the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan, China lab.\\n\\nBut, \"75% of all new infections are zoonotic,\" he said. The HIV virus that causes AIDS moved from chimpanzees to humans; influenza moved from birds and pigs to humans; the Ebola virus moved from bats and nonhuman primates to humans.\\n\\n\"Does that mean that COVID was not accidentally made in a lab? I don\\'t know. But all I can say is that, if you don\\'t know, you keep an open mind and you try and reject a conspiracy theory one way or another.\"\\n\\nIn the meantime, he stresses preventive measures in both wet markets and laboratories, for the U.S. to replenish its stock of personal protective equipment, and continued investment in basic and clinical biomedical research, in preparation for the inevitable future pandemic outbreak. \"The only way to address a perpetual challenge is to be perpetually prepared,\" he said.\\n\\nFauci said it\\'s important for us to think about lessons learned \"that might help us not only with the possibility of another outbreak, but maybe some of the things in our society that we need to scrutinize a bit more to make us a better society.\"\\n\\nAmerica, it appears, will survive this virus.\\n\\nThe lies infecting our nation are a graver threat.\\n\\n40 photos from The Richmond Forum through the years 1975 Ronald Reagan 1987 Diane Sawyer and Brent Scowcroft 1988 Oprah Winfrey 1995 Dave Barry 1996 Neil Armstrong 2000 Desmond Tutu 2000 John Glenn 2001 Benjamin Netanyahu 2002 Colin Powell 2002 Dick Clark 2002 James Baker and Madeleine Albright 2002 Ken Burns 2003 Cal Ripken Jr. 2003 Queen Noor and Benazir Bhutto 2003 Rudy Giuliani 2006 Rick Wagoner 2007 Alvin Toffler and Malcolm Gladwell 2007 B.B.

Accordingly, he recently ordered all Republicans to scuttle the bipartisan, long-negotiated Senate deal supporting Ukraine and limiting immigration that would be a victory for president Joe Biden. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, an election-denier, obeyed Trump by withholding a full House vote despite enough bipartisan votes for passage.\\n\\nHaving nominated Speaker Johnson and having always voiced support for Ukraine and for controlling immigration, McMorris Rodgers presumably could influence Johnson's actions. Now that the chance to rescue the rare bipartisan deal is past, Johnson is resisting yet another opportunity to support Ukraine in a funding bill passed by bipartisan senators.\\n\\nMcMorris Rodgers could contribute to immigration reform by correcting constant Republican misinformation; for example, crime rates and violent crime rates for both documented and undocumented immigrants are actually lower than for native-born Americans (PBS Newshour, Feb. 27).\\n\\nBut her likely worst immigration legacy she can't erase: She and then-Republican House Speaker John Boehner blocked a full House vote on comprehensive immigration reform, endorsed by then-President Barack Obama, despite enough bipartisan House votes for passage -- this after the Senate passed it overwhelmingly 68 to 32 on June 27, 2013.\\n\\nSo influencing Johnson might earn McMorris Rodgers some redemption.\\n\\nNORM LUTHER\\n\\nSpokane\", 'source': {'uri': 'yakimaherald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yakima Herald-Republic'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/b1/9b14ffde-e3c5-11ee-a28d-479ef5b1c12d/65f5eaa7e2aba.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 448618563, 'relevance': 1}\n",

On Aug. 8, 2000, Danielle Goldey and Meredith Kott attended a game at Dodger Stadium. At one point, as couples are wont to do, they smooched. Before long, security guards arrived, removed the women from their seats, and escorted them out of the ballpark. \"It was shocking,\" Goldey told me not long ago. \"I\\'m a diehard, true blue Dodger fan and this is happening. Are you kidding me?\"\\n\\nTheir friends, a man and a woman, kissed, too. But they were allowed to stay. What\\'s worse is that Goldey and Kott initially weren\\'t given a reason for being ejected. They later learned that another fan had complained. According to Goldey, the anonymous person had told someone, \"I don\\'t want my kids around those kinds of people.\"\\n\\nKissing at a ballgame can be a fraught experience. Kissing at a ballgame can be good, clean American fun. Somewhere between these two poles lies the Kiss Cam.\\n\\nThe exact origins of the Kiss Cam are unclear, but like so many American cultural artifacts with mixed legacies -- the Eagles, macrobiotics, porn -- its roots can be traced to Los Angeles in the 1970s. Somewhere in that decade, the Dodgers decided they needed a video board. Barry Stockhamer, a marketing guru who spent 30 years with the team, remembers touring ballparks in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Montreal in search of inspiration. All the in-game highlights he watched on those trips were on black-and-white screens. But Stockhamer\\'s employer wanted something bigger and shinier.\\n\\nAnd thus, Diamond Vision was born. Manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric and reportedly purchased for $3.5 million, the 20-by-28-foot glowing showpiece made its official debut at Dodger Stadium at the 1980 All-Star Game. \"Nine people run the scoreboard with a computer board resembling the one used to operate the space shuttle,\" United Press International gushed. In the same story, Stockhamer deemed it the \"largest color television in the world.\" (For comparison\\'s sake: Each of the comically gargantuan screens at AT&T Stadium in Dallas is 72 feet tall and 160 feet wide.) The newfangled attraction, which loomed high above left-center field, beamed highlights from the game (but never replays of close or controversial calls), snippets of out-of-town games, musical numbers, crowd shots. Cheering, jumping up and down, kissing -- it was all on display.\\n\\n\"It\\'s live theater,\" Stockhamer told me. \"If you tried it, you got an immediate response from fans.\" He began noticing that between innings, umpires would glance up at the board. Revered broadcaster Vin Scully also approved, regularly mentioning Diamond Vision on the air.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take long for other franchises to follow the Dodgers\\' lead. Amazingly, when the Mets shelled out $4 million on a new video board in the fall of 1981, club chairman Nelson Doubleday felt the need to reassure the media that the upgrade \"will in no way affect our commitment to making necessary investments to improve the team.\" (Eight months later, the Mets drafted Dwight Gooden.)\\n\\nIn 1986, the New York Times reported that 14 of Major League Baseball\\'s 26 parks had color screens. From a production standpoint, the advent of in-game entertainment presented unique challenges. John Franzone, now the Tampa Bay Lightning\\'s vice president of game presentation, worked for the Mets and Yankees in the \\'80s and \\'90s. He remembers live shots being tricky propositions. \"In NYC,\" he said in an email, \"I wasn\\'t worried about Kiss Cam as much as avoiding Middle Finger Cam.\"\\n\\nBy the early \\'90s, seemingly every arena in the nation had its own video board. Technological advances, like wireless cameras and cheaper, stronger lenses, \"made the Kiss Cam (and other fan shot interactive features) proliferate as low-hanging entertainment fruit,\" according to Franzone.\\n\\nBob Becker, executive vice president of Van Wagner Big Screen Network, the company in charge of scoreboard content and production at the Super Bowl, helped introduce the Kiss Cam during the Florida Marlins\\' inaugural season. It took only three easy steps: Blast a Sinatra love song through the Joe Robbie Stadium speakers, point a camera at a couple, and put them on the screen accompanied by a heart wipe. It was simple, and it stuck.\\n\\nThe Kiss Cam has turned up in movies (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days), sitcoms (Modern Family), and as a WWE gimmick (it was The Great Khali\\'s signature bit). It been used to catch wanted criminals. Two years ago, while sitting courtside at the Verizon Center for Team USA\\'s Olympic tuneup against Brazil, Barack Obama noticed that he and Michelle were on the arena\\'s video boards. But when he leaned in to lock lips with the First Lady, she didn\\'t reciprocate.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t see the Kiss Cam part,\" Michelle later claimed on The Tonight Show, \"so I didn\\'t know we were supposed to kiss.\" Naturally, Malia Obama, in the words of her mother, \"was just disgusted with us.\" The teenager proceeded to explain the gimmick to her parents, and when the Kiss Cam came around again, they embraced.\\n\\n\"It\\'s still the crowd favorite,\" Becker said. \"It could be your first game ever or your 1,000th game.\" When the Kiss Cam catches you, he said, \"You know what you\\'re going to do.\"\\n\\nBut that\\'s just the problem now. As the Kiss Cam became a staple of sporting events, the gimmick\\'s underlying assumptions -- that sports fans were straight, that they would find something funny about the prospect of two men kissing -- began to fall away. The Kiss Cam hasn\\'t kept up with the times. Consider: Next fall, the NFL\\'s massive stadium video boards are more likely to feature an openly gay man making a bone-jarring tackle than an openly gay man kissing his boyfriend.\\n\\nIn 2011, Jezebel\\'s Erin Gloria Ryan interviewed Jeff Szynal, who oversees scoreboard operation for the Chicago White Sox:\\n\\nWhen queueing up for a fan-cam bit, his camera operators look for people who are engaged with each other and with the game and who look unlikely to embarrass themselves or the team (AKA: not sloppy). After all, people consume alcohol at sporting events, and alcohol makes people act like jerks sometimes, especially when they know that a lot of people are paying attention to them (see: Mardi Gras).\\n\\nThere\\'s little doubt that at every game, several same-sex couples meet that criteria. Yet Kiss Cam operators typically shy away from two men or two women. Some teams don\\'t even attempt the gimmick at all. The Washington Mystics -- which, like all WNBA teams, should eternally be thankful for its lesbian fans -- have no use for the Kiss Cam. \"We got a lot of kids here,\" managing partner Sheila Johnson told Washington Post columnist Mike Wise in 2009. \"We just don\\'t find it appropriate.\" Slate\\'s Mark Joseph Stern rightly called that kind of bogus reasoning \"the blatantly bigoted old plea to think of the children.\"\\n\\nAmong homophobes, this brand of gay panic masquerading as thoughtful parenting is a common trope. Exhibit A: David Whitley\\'s 2010 FanHouse column in which he argued that grade schoolers are too young to understand why two men or two women might kiss.\\n\\n\"The sooner my kids see examples of racial harmony, the better,\" wrote Whitley. (In 2012, he argued that biracial quarterback Colin Kaepernick\\'s tattoos made him look like a parolee.) \"But this issue has torn up entire religions. Call me homophobic, but I just don\\'t think a 5- or 10-year-old brain is ready to tackle those complexities.\" (My wife, a preschool teacher, long ago informed me that 2- and 3-year-olds have no trouble grasping the concept.)\\n\\nWhen two people of the same sex are featured on the Kiss Cam, they\\'re usually teammates. \"Because, you see, there\\'s nothing quite as insulting to the rival squad as suggesting that two of their guys might want to kiss each other,\" Kyle Weidie snarked in Washington City Paper.\\n\\nThere are many examples of this, but let\\'s look at one from January 2002. During a Flyers-Maple Leafs game at Air Canada Centre, the Kiss Cam found Philadelphia\\'s bench. Naturally, Jeremy Roenick proceeded, in the words of Sports Illustrated\\'s Michael Farber, to \"plant a wet one\" on teammate Mark Recchi. The crowd went wild. \"Biggest roar all night,\" Roenick quipped.\\n\\nThis can be cute and mostly harmless, particularly when celebrities like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, or Dustin Hoffman and Jason Bateman, are involved. But Stern argues that there\\'s a thin undercurrent of homophobia running beneath the gag. Becker, for one, said he wouldn\\'t put a same-sex couple on the Kiss Cam in order \"to get a laugh. No.\"\\n\\nBut it happens. In September 2010, the Kiss Cam at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis focused on two guys in rival jerseys. \"The crowd laughed and booed when the two men tried to shoo away the cameras,\" the Post-Dispatch reported. \"But there were gay men in the crowd who said it was offensive that the Rams organization would choose to embarrass Arizona fans by portraying them as a gay couple.\"\\n\\nPride St. Louis, which coincidentally had planned an \"Out at the Ballpark\" day at Busch Stadium for that month, figured it was a good time to push the Cardinals to put a gay couple on the Kiss Cam. \"We always felt left out because the Kiss Cam always singles out heterosexual couples,\" Harrison Roberts, manager of local gay bar Just John, told the Post-Dispatch. \"But after what happened at the Rams game, all the gay and lesbian fans that were there felt embarrassed and a little degraded. Why shouldn\\'t we be on the camera, too?\" The \"Out at the Ballpark\" event reportedly went well, but the Kiss Cam once again ignored same-sex couples.\\n\\nThen, about a year later, there was a bit of a breakthrough. At a Giants-Cubs game in San Francisco in August 2011, Thom Watson and Jeff Tabaco ended up on the AT&T Park Kiss Cam. The couple embraced warmly. The moment, it seemed, was not played for a cheap laugh.\\n\\n\"It does piss me off that San Francisco did it before L.A.,\" Goldey said. But she applauded the sentiment. The goal, she added, should be to put same-sex couples in the Kiss Cam\\'s regular rotation. It\\'s not a very difficult proposition.\\n\\n\"Make it more inclusive,\" said Doug Johnson, co-creator of PuckBuddys, a site aimed at gay hockey fans. \"Just pick people. It doesn\\'t have to be: man and woman.\" A kiss, he said, is \"not a car crash,\" no matter who\\'s doing the smooching.\\n\\nLast September, the Dodgers held their first LGBT Night Out. Newly minted gay icon Jason Collins threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and the Gay Men\\'s Chorus of Los Angeles sang the national anthem. Goldey was there, in her usual seats. She\\'d never stopped loving the Dodgers, even after her expulsion.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t my team that did this,\" she said, explaining that it wasn\\'t the players\\' fault that a handful of employees had acted so stupidly 14 years ago. It took a few weeks and a threatened lawsuit, but the organization eventually apologized. The club reportedly donated 5,000 tickets to gay and lesbian organizations and promised that its staff would undergo sensitivity training. \"I think they stepped up to the plate more than they had to,\" Goldey said at the time. \"All we wanted was an apology. ... I\\'m very proud to be a Dodger fan.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say the incident doesn\\'t irk her still. After all, this was supposedly progressive Los Angeles, not some backwater. Despite her comments at the time, Goldey allowed that she wasn\\'t satisfied with the team\\'s response. \"I wish [the Dodgers] would\\'ve done more,\" she said. \"They walked away doing what they had to do.\"\\n\\nAt that game a few months ago, Goldey hoped a gay or lesbian couple would end up on the Kiss Cam, but it didn\\'t happen. Given the chance, Goldey said she would\\'ve taken it. Her fianc√©e, however, may not have been on board.\\n\\n\"She is definitely not a Kiss Cam person,\" Goldey said. \"She is very private. The irony is, if they did show us on it, I would feel obligated. Now\\'s the time we have to do it.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'deadspin.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Deadspin'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/19fp3i0pwnkdfjpg.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2, 'wgt': 448618481, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Her government career began with a stint as chief of staff for Strobe Talbott, a well-known hard-liner on Russia who served as deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, and she has held key positions in the foreign policy establishment during the 30 years since then.\\n\\nThe retiring diplomat is known for her unflattering and candid remarks about both allied countries and rivals such as Russia. In Washington, she is regarded as the most senior official to retain the \"neocon\" worldview.\\n\\nNuland\\'s family, as it happens, is renowned in neoconservative circles. Her husband is Robert Kagan, the preeminent neocon ideologue and a prominent advocate of liberal interventionism. Kagan\\'s younger brother Frederick, a conservative military historian, is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, which is itself a leading conservative think tank in the US. And Frederick\\'s wife Kimberly Kagan is the founder and president of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, which the Western media often quotes on the course of the war in Ukraine.\\n\\nBoth Nuland and Kagan are of Jewish descent, which is also true of many people holding key positions in American foreign policy.\\n\\nThe war in Ukraine would be almost inexplicable if not for Nuland\\'s role. While serving first as principal deputy national security adviser for Vice President Dick Cheney and then as ambassador to NATO in the Bush administration, she was a fiery advocate of the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan and the expansion of NATO.\\n\\nIn the NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008, Nuland, who was then ambassador to NATO, pushed through membership action plans defining the protocol and timeframe for Ukraine and Georgia\\'s admission to NATO over objections from Germany and France.\\n\\nThat was the spark that eventually led to the conflagration of Russia\\'s war against Ukraine. In a backlash to these moves, Russia soon went to war against Georgia, which set off an ongoing deterioration in its relationship with the US and culminated in the current war.\\n\\nWhile serving as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under President Barack Obama, Nuland was closely involved in the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine that brought down the pro-Russian government in 2014, which was the starting point of Russia\\'s hostilities against Ukraine. She personally encouraged Ukrainian demonstrators by handing out sandwiches at a protest.\\n\\nRecordings have also been leaked of Nuland\\'s phone calls with the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, in which she heaped vulgar invectives on the EU for its tepid stance and mulled who ought to be Ukraine\\'s next president. That\\'s why Russia denounced Nuland as the \"princess of darkness\" and accused the US of engineering a coup in Ukraine.\\n\\nAfter the retirement of Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Nuland became acting deputy secretary and was considered a strong candidate for permanent deputy secretary. But Nuland was shunted aside in favor of Kurt Campbell, the coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council.\\n\\nNuland\\'s retirement is especially provocative since it comes as the war in Ukraine is tilting in Russia\\'s favor and as Putin was decisively elected to a fifth term as Russian president.\\n\\nAt the end of last year, Russia focused on consolidating its territorial gains, and since the New Year, it has been unleashing an offensive to gain more ground. We\\'re looking at the prospect of a \"frozen conflict\" in which Russia works to solidify control over the territory it has conquered.\\n\\nThat gives the US reason to seek an exit strategy. Campbell\\'s appointment as deputy secretary can be understood in the same context, given his ardent support for Washington\\'s so-called Indo-Pacific strategy and its alliances with South Korea and Japan.\\n\\nThe war in Ukraine is already having serious ramifications for the Korean Peninsula. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has provided artillery shells and other weapons to Ukraine, which has spurred Russia to upgrade its strategic relationship with North Korea.\\n\\nWith its appointment of Campbell as deputy secretary of state, the US is signaling that the main front is shifting to the Indo-Pacific region and that it will push South Korea even harder to align with that strategy. The deterioration of relations with Russia further restricts the options available to South Korea, which has already lost all contact with North Korea.\\n\\nThe Summit for Democracy, which the Biden administration is using in an attempt to galvanize its allies for a confrontation against China and Russia, kicked off in Seoul on Monday, the first time the summit has been held outside the US. That is a testament to how South Korea is being incorporated into Washington\\'s foreign policy.\\n\\nInside South Korea, even the main opposition Democratic Party has forced a farming community activist off its list of proportional representatives for the upcoming general elections because she had participated in protests against the deployment of American THAAD missile defense systems in Korea.\\n\\nSouth Koreans can\\'t take their eyes off the US as it struggles with the prospect of Russia gaining momentum in the war against Ukraine and the dilemma of having to support Israel despite intense public criticism over the war in the Gaza Strip.', 'source': {'uri': 'english.hani.co.kr', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ÌïúÍ≤®Î†àÏã†Î¨∏'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://flexible.img.hani.co.kr/flexible/normal/970/647/imgdb/original/2024/0320/6017109215829196.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 448618140, 'relevance': 1}\n",

Despite anecdotal reports that Trump had made some inroads with Blacks in 2020, he won just 8% of the Black vote, according to Pew Research Center. That was the same share he won in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nSo it\\'s quite something that polls show more than 20% of Black voters saying they will vote for Trump in 2024 in his rematch with President Joe Biden in states likely to determine who wins. The New York Times/Siena poll back in early November had Trump with 21% Black support while Biden was the choice of 71% in six key battleground states. In early March, Trump\\'s total rose to 23% while Biden\\'s fell to 66% in those states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe Democrats reached out to Black voters in the current election by moving up South Carolina\\'s primary, a recognition of that state\\'s Black voters in playing a crucial role in handing Biden the Democratic nomination in 2020. The gesture apparently isn\\'t having much effect, at least if polls are to be believed.\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear. It\\'s early. And voters are just starting to engage. They\\'ll focus far more in late summer and early fall on a presidential choice many have said they\\'re unhappy to have been handed.\\n\\nBut it\\'s worth considering why this substantial number of Black voters at this early stage would even be open to Trump.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter all, we\\'re talking about a man who from his earliest days as a New York real estate developer was accused of racist business practices. The federal government successfully sued him in the 1970s for discriminating against Black apartment seekers. In the early 1990s, Black pastors accused him of stirring racial animus surrounding the \"Central Park Five\" rape case, for which all the suspects were later exonerated -- except by Trump, who would not allow the confessions of another man get in the way of his unfounded accusations.\\n\\nMost notoriously, he became a leading promoter of the \"birther\" conspiracy theory, which questioned President Barack Obama\\'s citizenship despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\\n\\nBut all that and other controversies have not much dimmed sentiments like those of several young Black men MSNBC interviewed in a Charleston, South Carolina, barbershop in early February.\\n\\nAnecdotally, this seems to be more of a male phenomenon. Black women tend to turn out in greater percentages for Democrats than any other major demographic. So what explains Trump\\'s appeal to Black men, in particular? One of the young men said, quite simply, \"Money.\" Trump has built a reputation of being \"the money man,\" the young voter said.\\n\\nMore recently, I\\'ve heard similar responses from my own son -- which is a far cry from the neo-socialist attitudes that caught his fancy when he was a collegiate volunteer in Obama\\'s 2008 presidential run.\\n\\nNow 34 and entering the business world as co-owner of a comic book store in Maryland, he\\'s starting to sound more like, yes, a Republican, although fortunately minus the MAGA movement\\'s crackpot conspiracy theories -- except when he wants to annoy his parents, which still seems to be his favorite pastime outside of making money.\\n\\nAh, well, I tell myself, he\\'s a grown man who has to learn some lessons for himself. There\\'s a lesson here for any of us who expect the new, rising generation to automatically embrace their parents\\' attitudes without their parents\\' experiences.\\n\\nTalking to young Black voters, I hear a lot of questions as they try to understand why Biden and other traditional politicians have not done more for Black people, as well as others from here to the Middle East and beyond, even as I ask myself, \"Why hasn\\'t Biden done more to make this case for himself?\"\\n\\nSure, he\\'s a busy man -- and his State of the Union speech offered a taste of the messages his campaign is beginning to make. He owes that to the voters who want to make an intelligent and informed choice even though, unlike me, they don\\'t have the luxury of following politics for a living.\\n\\nInvalid username/password.\\n\\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\\n\\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

He received 7 million more votes than Donald Trump in 2020, and the fundamental partisan lines that separate our nation seem unlikely to shift significantly in 2024.\\n\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\n\\nJohn M. Crisp, an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service, lives in Texas and can be reached at jcrispcolumns@gmail.com.\\n\\nBut maybe they will. Some polls show Trump leading Biden. In any case, we don\\'t decide our elections by popular vote. Out of millions of votes, a few thousand in critical states could determine the outcome in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn short, the election is a toss-up, which calls for a realistic look at what will happen if each man wins.\\n\\nIf Trump wins: Trump\\'s policy positions are often vague. It\\'s not always clear where he stands on abortion, for example, and he recently suggested -- maybe inadvertently -- that he would be open to cuts in Social Security and Medicare. In fact, in 2020 the Republican Party\\'s reluctance to commit to detailed policies was expressed by its failure to publish a platform.\\n\\nPolicy ambiguity creates a vacuum that could be filled by \"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\" an 887-page document produced by The Heritage Foundation. The \"Mandate\" hasn\\'t been endorsed by Trump as yet, but it represents a detailed blueprint for a remake of the federal government that would appeal to Trump.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe \"Mandate\" calls for lower corporate taxes, further restraints on abortion rights and rejection of measures to limit climate change. Most important, it transfers power away from the so-called administrative state in the direction of the White House.\\n\\nIn short, if you want a sense of what might happen if Trump is elected, the \"Mandate\" wouldn\\'t be a bad place to start.\\n\\nWhat else would a Trump victory entail? It could mean the end of NATO, but certainly the end of Ukraine. A second Trump administration would probably be friendlier to authoritarians: Hungary\\'s president, Viktor Orban, recently enjoyed a congenial visit to Mar-a-Lago.\\n\\nAt the least a Trump victory would make history: For the first time our nation will have elected a man who still denies the results of the last election.\\n\\nIf Biden wins: A Biden victory is less complicated and less earthshaking. Depending on the makeup of the House and Senate, we might expect a realignment toward the left, including efforts to restore reproductive rights and reinforcement of the social safety net. Efforts will probably be made to save Ukraine and to reconfirm our support for NATO.\\n\\nAbove all, a Biden victory would be a recommitment to the classic narrative of normal American politics, the tug-of-war between \"big\" government and \"small\" government.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou might have the impression that I prefer a Biden victory. But that\\'s irrelevant; everything here is either verifiable fact or a plausible, defensible conjecture. Here\\'s another plausible conjecture:\\n\\nThe most important difference between a Trump victory and a Biden victory is that if Trump wins, Biden will hand over power peacefully, just as President Barack Obama did in 2017; if Biden wins, Trump will reject the result.\\n\\nIn fact, a peaceful acceptance of a Biden victory by Trump and his millions of committed, well-armed followers is impossible to imagine. We have every reason to believe that they will resort to violence to overturn the election. That\\'s what Jan. 6 was all about. And a recent American Enterprise Institute poll indicates that 39% of Republicans believe that political violence is sometimes necessary and justified.\\n\\nIn short, it\\'s naive to believe that the Trump era will end without bloodshed, and it\\'s fatal to fail to prepare for it. The question will be whether a new Biden administration and the millions who support it are prepared to commit the violence that will be required to suppress a second attempt at insurrection.\\n\\nToo dramatic? Don\\'t take my word for it. Last Saturday in Ohio, Trump said that if he is not elected, \"It\\'s going to be a blood bath for the country.\" He should be taken seriously and literally.\\n\\nInvalid username/password.\\n\\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\\n\\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Mais √† quel point la France est-elle impuissante en mati√®re de lutte anti-drogue ? Existe-t-il un √©l√©ment objectif de mesure des succ√®s d\\'une telle bataille ?\\n\\nXavier Raufer : Oui, partout et toujours, un outil objectif sait mesurer le succ√®s ou l\\'√©chec dans la lutte contre le trafic de stup√©fiants. La France en dispose aujourd\\'hui m√™me, et il est curieux que les m√©dias d\\'information l\\'ignorent. Que, vu son √©chec, le gouvernement occulte cet outil de mesure pr√©cis et limpide se comprend - mais l\\' \"ignorance\" m√©diatique...\\n\\nIl s\\'agit d\\'une sorte de thermom√®tre. La petite a 40 de fi√®vre ? On la soigne ; puis √ßa retombe √† 37. Elle √©tait malade, elle gu√©rit : simple, non ? Pareil pour la drogue. Voil√† comment √ßa fonctionne. Le commerce de tout produit, licite ou non, ob√©it √† la loi de l\\'offre et de la demande, pour les Carambars comme pour l\\'h√©ro√Øne : √† client√®le en gros √©gale, si ce produit inonde le mar\\xadch√©, son prix baisse. S\\'il manque, √ßa monte.\\n\\nPar coups de poing, l\\'action officielle... \"pilonnage... place nette...\" pr√©tend d√©sorgani\\xadser le commerce illicite des stup√©fiants et saisir en masse la drogue sur les points de deal (on dit les \"fours\", chez les narcos). Si ces bandes doivent se terrer ; si des quan\\xadtit√©s de drogue sont saisies, forc√©ment, son prix augmente. Preuve : lors du confine\\xadment : transports √† l\\'arr√™t et dealers seuls sous la vid√©osurveillance urbaine, la drogue s\\'est rar√©fi√©e, vite et fort. En dix jours, ses prix explosaient de + 50 √† 70% ; ensuite bien s√ªr, quand la vie reprend, elle retrouve son prix.\\n\\nPour que l\\'action antidrogue soit jug√©e efficace, il faut et il suffit que les prix des stup√©\\xadfiants augmentent ET que leur qualit√© baisse : le gouvernement lance son action anti\\xaddrogue avec une coca√Øne √† 80 euros/gramme ? ce prix doit grimper √† 120 euros, deux ou trois ans apr√®s. Si sa puret√© de d√©part est de 70%, elle doit de m√™me tomber √† 50 ou 40%. Or chaque mois, des ex\\xadperts ach√®tent en douce aux dealers un gramme de coca√Øne, d\\'h√©ro√Øne, une barrette de hasch, analysent tout puis signalent les ten\\xaddances. Les prix augmentent et la qua\\xadlit√© baisse ? Bravo au gouvernement. Si c\\'est l\\'inverse, son action est inefficace voire fic\\xadtive.\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, la drogue-reine est la coca√Øne. De 2012 √† 2022, ses usagers passent en France de 400 000 √† UN MILLION. De plus, cet \"ascenseur social\" sans √©gal rend fous les bandits, qu\\'il peut rendre milliardaires en peu d\\'ann√©es. Ainsi, la coca√Øne inonde l\\'Europe. En 2023, au seul port belge d\\'Anvers, on en saisit 116 tonnes. Or en France, \"pilonnage\" ou pas, le prix de la coca√Øne baisse de 30% de\\xadpuis l\\'arriv√©e de M. Darmanin : 80‚Ç¨/gramme en 2020, √† parfois 50‚Ç¨ √† pr√©sent, vers la fronti√®re du nord ; et d√©sormais, cette coca√Øne se vend quasi-pure dans la rue.\\n\\nLe prix de l\\'h√©ro√Øne s\\'effondre aussi. Dans le grand-Est, on la trouve √† 9 ‚Ç¨/gramme, m√™me des enfants peuvent s\\'en offrir avec leur argent de poche. Enfin, le prix du can\\xadnabis stagne. Bref, le thermom√®tre de la drogue signale un lourd √©chec du gouverne\\xadment - ce que les magistrats constatent, m√™me si le pr√©sident de la R√©publique passe son temps √† Marseille, √† claironner le contraire.\\n\\nMatthieu Hocque : La France souffre d\\'impuissance en mati√®re de lutte anti-drogue car elle ne ma√Ætrise pas les quantit√©s produites √† l\\'√©chelle mondiale. En effet, sans contr√¥le de la production de drogue, nous d√©pendons des politiques anti-drogue des pays producteurs principalement dans les pays du Sud. Or, il existe une double mutation depuis les ann√©es 2010. D\\'une part, les routes de la drogue se sont diversifi√©es en plus de l\\'Am√©rique Latine (coca√Øne, h√©ro√Øne) au Moyen Orient (cannabis, opiac√©s) et en Afrique (cannabis). Seulement, cela implique de facto un √©parpillement de l\\'effort de nos politiques publiques. D\\'autre part, la production de drogue a explos√© en Am√©rique Latine depuis que les Etats-Unis ont op√©r√© un changement. En effet, lors de la r√©volution conservatrice de Thatcher et Reagan dans les ann√©es 1980, ces pays sont touch√©s par des crises de l\\'h√©ro√Øne et la coca√Øne et ont men√© une guerre sans merci aux barons de la drogue en Am√©rique Latine. Or, √† la suite du rapport de l\\'Organisation des √âtats am√©ricains (OEA) de 2013 arguant les effets nocifs sur la vie des populations locales, Barack Obama d√©cide de d√©criminaliser cette politique et de mettre un terme √† la pr√©sence militaire am√©ricaine contre les narcotrafiquants. Cons√©quence de cela, la production de coca√Øne a plus que doubl√© en Colombie depuis 2013 selon l\\'ONUDC.\\n\\nSeulement, dans ce contexte, l\\'Etat fran√ßais a organis√© sa propre impuissance. En premier lieu, en transf√©rant la politique de gestion des fronti√®res √† l\\'Union europ√©enne sans garantie de collaboration europ√©enne, nous n\\'avons plus les moyens de lutter contre l\\'entr√©e de drogue sur notre sol. Selon les chiffres du minist√®re de l\\'Int√©rieur, pr√®s de 75% des saisies de coca√Øne ont d√©sormais lieu dans un port ou un a√©roport qui sont des lieux ne d√©pendant que des services nationaux. Secondement, nous avons laiss√© prosp√©rer des Territoires perdus de la R√©publique d√©crits par Georges Bensoussan devenus autonomes et sous le contr√¥le des gangs se partageant un march√© de 3 milliards d\\'euros selon l\\'OFDT. Ainsi, dans plusieurs territoires, ce ne sont plus les lois de la R√©publique qui sont appliqu√©es, mais celles des gangs qui se livrent une guerre territoriale. Selon les statistiques de la cellule du suivi du plan bandes de la pr√©fecture de police, les affrontements entre les bandes ont augment√© de 18% dans l\\'agglom√©ration parisienne en 2023.\\n\\nIl ne suffit pas de d√©cr√©ter \" ne rien c√©der \" aux trafiquants pour y parvenir r√©ellement. En effet, le seul √©l√©ment objectif qui permettra de mesurer les succ√®s d\\'une telle bataille est la diminution du nombre de morts dans des r√®glements de compte. Or, √† Marseille, il y a eu plus de morts √† cause de la guerre des gangs sur les trois derni√®res ann√©es que sur la p√©riode 1950-2000.\\n\\n\" Nous sommes en train de perdre la guerre contre les trafiquants √† Marseille \", a r√©\\xadcemment estim√© Isabelle Fort, responsable du p√¥le criminalit√© organis√©e du parquet de Marseille. La France est-elle d√©j√†, au moins en partie, un narco √âtat ? La bataille contre les trafiquants de drogue est-elle d√©j√† perdue ?\\n\\nXavier Raufer : Non bien s√ªr, car m√™me un gouvernement fable peut √©craser le plus f√©roce gang en quelques semaines, s\\'il en d√©cide ainsi - les vraies mafia, c\\'est une autre af\\xadfaire, mais on n\\'en a pas de natives, en France. Mais d√©cider n\\'est pas tout, m√™me si l\\'appareil r√©\\xadgalien Fran√ßais reste le plus robuste d\\'Europe. Encore faut-il qu\\'il re√ßoive des ordres pertinents, fond√©s sur une approche pointue du r√©el criminel, bien diff√©rent de ce qu\\'imaginent les altitudes √©lys√©ennes. Il faudrait aussi que le corps des commis\\xadsaires s\\'int√©resse plus au monde criminel qu\\'au sort, certes triste, de minorit√©s dot√©es outre-Atlantique du statut de peuple-Christ. Commis\\xadsaire de police oui, assis\\xadtante sociale des quartiers nord de Marseille, euh...\\n\\nMatthieu Hocque : La France n\\'est pas un narco Etat au sens du FMI, soit un Etat dans lequel \" toutes les institutions l√©gitimes ont √©t√© p√©n√©tr√©es par le pouvoir et la richesse issus du trafic de drogue \". En revanche, elle l\\'est davantage car nous avons deux Etats parall√®les se disputant le territoire. En effet, d\\'un c√¥t√©, nous avons la R√©publique et sa police l√©gitime et de l\\'autre, les trafiquants dominant les Territoires perdus gr√¢ce au business de la drogue, du crime organis√© et au manque de volontarisme des politiques. Or, ce conflit structure la soci√©t√© car les deux entit√©s disposent de moyens cons√©quents. Selon le rapport de l\\'Index global du crime organis√© de 2023, la France figure au m√™me titre que les Etats-Unis, le Mexique, la Colombie, la Malaisie, l\\'Afrique du Sud, etc. dans les pays o√π la criminalit√© et le trafic de drogue est le plus √©lev√© tout en ayant d\\'importants moyens pour y faire face.\\n\\nAinsi, la bataille contre les trafiquants n\\'est pas perdue. Une victoire contre les trafiquants est possible qu\\'√† deux principes. D\\'une part, il est n√©cessaire qu\\'aboutir √† un consensus des Fran√ßais pour des solutions fortes pour reconqu√©rir les Territoires perdus. Or, selon les enqu√™tes d\\'opinion, les Fran√ßais placent la lutte contre l\\'ins√©curit√© entre leur deuxi√®me ou quatri√®me priorit√©. D\\'autre part, il est n√©cessaire d\\'emporter l\\'adh√©sion des r√©sidents de ces quartiers. Or, les r√©actions aux √©meutes de 2023 ont montr√© que les habitants de ces quartiers ont pl√©biscit√© des mesures plus fortes que lors des √©meutes de 2005, o√π la logique d\\'apaisement primait. Ainsi, les Fran√ßais comme les habitants de ces quartiers ne redoutent pas le changement mais l\\'attendent avec impatience.\\n\\nQuand on regarde ce qui a √©t√© fait ailleurs, dans certains pays d\\'Am√©rique La\\xadtine ou encore aux √âtats-Unis subissant une √©pid√©mie d\\'opio√Ødes, que pour\\xadrions-nous faire pour lutter contre le trafic de drogue ? Existe-t-il des succ√®s, mais aussi des √©checs que nous devrions √©tudier ?\\n\\nMatthieu Hocque : Un probl√®me ne peut pas √™tre r√©solu avec le m√™me mode de pens√©e qui l\\'a g√©n√©r√©.\\n\\nTout d\\'abord, sur le plan international, nous avons tourn√© le dos √† la r√©volution conservatrice pour adopter une politique conciliante √† l\\'√©gard des pays producteurs. Ainsi, la lutte contre les trafiquants de drogue d√©pend d√©sormais de leur bon vouloir. Or, certains r√©gimes ont int√©r√™t dans le trafic en raison de sa place dans l\\'√©conomie. Nous devons donc rompre avec cette logique conciliante pour privil√©gier la logique du rapport de force. Pour cela, nous disposons de leviers de pression tels que des sanctions √©conomiques europ√©ennes ou le conditionnement de l\\'aide au d√©veloppement √† l\\'atteinte d\\'objectifs de lutte contre les trafics. Tout cela doit les conduire √† signer un nouvel accord international, un \" Vienne III \", ouvrant la voie √† une collaboration renforc√©e pour la guerre aux trafiquants car moins il y a de drogue produite dans le monde, moins elle sera achemin√©e vers chez nous.\\n\\nEnsuite, nous devons reconqu√©rir les Territoires perdus. Pour cela, nous devons rompre avec la logique d\\'apaisement pour adopter une logique de reconqu√™te. Pour cela, il sera n√©cessaire d\\'offrir tous les moyens possibles √† l\\'administration en d√©cr√©tant un √©tat d\\'urgence mais localis√© par d√©partement concern√©. L\\'objectif de l\\'√©tat d\\'urgence est de massifier les saisies d\\'armes lourdes par le biais de perquisitions administratives afin de d√©sarmer les trafiquants sur le mod√®le de Fran√ßois Hollande apr√®s les attentats de novembre 2015. Cela doit constituer le cadre administratif d\\'une v√©ritable politique r√©pressive sur le mod√®le de Rudolph Giuliani, ancien maire de New-York dans les ann√©es 1990 qui mena une guerre farouche aux trafiquants et consommateurs en syst√©matisant les arrestations de toutes les personnes ayant un comportement \" anti-social \".\\n\\nEnfin, la France a suivi les √©volutions des soci√©t√©s occidentales qui consid√®rent d√©sormais le consommateur comme un \" malade \" plut√¥t que comme une partie du probl√®me. Or, il y a 5 millions de consommateurs r√©guliers de cannabis et pr√®s de 650 000 pour la coca√Øne selon l\\'OFDT, alimentant les trafics. De ce fait, il faut rompre avec cette logique pour responsabiliser les consommateurs avec une mesure simple : augmenter l\\'amende forfaitaire de 150‚Ç¨ pour consommation jusqu\\'√† 1 000‚Ç¨ ; pour un r√©el effet dissuasif.\\n\\nXavier Raufer : Tout pays est unique ; impossible de pr√©senter au m√©decin le bilan de sant√© de son cousin Ernest ; ni de transplanter en France les succ√®s ou √©checs d\\'autres pays. Il faut d\\'abord que le gouvernement exige de ses services un diagnostic r√©aliste du terrain. Clairement, il ne l\\'a pas aujourd\\'hui ; sinon, il n\\'enverrait pas ses CRS-touristes visiter les cit√©s hors-contr√¥le, o√π chacun sait qu\\'ils viennent pour quelques heures ; au pire, quelques jours, et o√π on attend gentiment leur d√©part pour reprendre le business.\\n\\nCriminologie, cours N¬∞1 : c\\'est \"l\\'effet de d√©placement\", dans le temps ou l\\'espace se\\xadlon l\\'opportunit√©. Il est sid√©rant que √ßa ne soit pas compris, alors qu\\'on a vu pr√©cis√©\\xadment √ßa advenir apr√®s le confinement-COVID ; et en sachant que les ca√Øds gagnent des mil\\xadlions et peuvent donc patienter des mois m√™mes, sans vraie g√®ne.\\n\\nFaudrait-il accompagner la r√©pression - si toutefois elle √©tait vraiment appli\\xadqu√©e - √† une autre forme de lutte pour faire face √† ce fl√©au ?\\n\\nMatthieu Hocque : La France n\\'applique pas r√©ellement de r√©pression, cela est plut√¥t m√™me l\\'inverse. La difficult√© r√©side dans le fait que les petits dealers sont aussi des consommateurs qui dealent pour leur consommation personnelle. A titre d\\'exemple, la gestion de la consommation de crack √† Paris privil√©gie plut√¥t l\\'ouverture de salles shoot et le soin plut√¥t que la r√©pression. Seulement, cette politique a abouti √† une augmentation vertigineuse de 52 % au cours de la derni√®re d√©cennie de la consommation selon l\\'OFDT.\\n\\nIl faudrait accompagner la r√©pression, d\\'une politique de pr√©vention efficace et non pas d\\'envisager la d√©p√©nalisation. En effet, la d√©p√©nalisation d√©grade les indicateurs de sant√© publique comme le montrent les exemples hollandais ou canadien. D\\'abord, elle fait augmenter la consommation (1). Au Canada, la consommation de cannabis a augment√© de 5 points, ce qui √©quivaudrait √† pr√®s de 3 millions de personnes suppl√©mentaires en France. De surcro√Æt, l\\'augmentation de la disponibilit√© et de la consommation de cannabis accro√Æt le risque que les jeunes commencent √† fumer encore plus jeune (2). En France, l\\'√¢ge moyen de la premi√®re consommation de cannabis est de 15,3 ans, tandis qu\\'au Canada, il est inf√©rieur √† 15 ans. Enfin, la d√©p√©nalisation ne r√®glera pas la question du crime organis√© puisque le cannabis ne repr√©sente que 40% du march√© de la drogue (3).\\n\\nLa pr√©vention est rentable et a fonctionn√© pour le cannabis. En effet, la drogue co√ªte pr√®s de 1,1% du PIB √† la France. Seulement, notre politique de pr√©vention souffre aujourd\\'hui d\\'une vision trop infantilisante des consommateurs. Or, la consommation excessive de drogue dans la soci√©t√© est un marqueur de d√©clin civilisationnel comme le montrent les exemples de l\\'Empire romain et de la Chine du XIX√®me si√®cle avec l\\'opium.\\n\\nXavier Raufer : Bien s√ªr ; nous criminologues savons que la pr√©vention, la m√©diation, sont cruciaux dans les zones hors-contr√¥le ; pour aller vite, ce que M. Borloo proposait et qu\\'Emmanuel Macron a balay√© d\\'un revers de main, sans qu\\'on sache trop pourquoi. Mais d\\'abord vient la pacification de ces cit√©s, elle, vraiment pr√©judicielle.
