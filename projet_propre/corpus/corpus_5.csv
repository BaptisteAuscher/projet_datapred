The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has warned young Nigerians to be wary of fake oil and gas jobs in West African countries.

The agency disclosed that it uncovered a new ploy by some human traffickers exploiting coordinated global brand trademarks and offering unrealistic oil and gas job offers to traffic unsuspecting youths and other classes of people to neighbouring West African countries for various forms of exploitation.

A statement on Sunday by NAPTIP Communication Officer, Adekoye Vincent, said that the Director-General of NAPTIP, Prof Fatima Waziri-Azi, revealed the alarming trend at the agency's headquarters in Abuja while discussing emerging trends in human trafficking for 2024.

Titled 'Beware of Fake Oil and Gas Jobs in West African Countries... NAPTIPS Alerts Nigerians On New Tricks By Human Traffickers,' the anti-human trafficking agency said it had redoubled its efforts recently through enhanced partnership, ""collaboration, diligent prosecution, and extensive awareness campaigns aimed at bolstering its operations, resulting in a significant increase in convictions of human traffickers.""

The statement quoted the NAPTIP DG as emphasising the need for comprehensive enlightenment strategies to equip Nigerians with timely and accurate information to reduce their vulnerability.

Waziri-Azi said, ""As part of our comprehensive enlightenment strategies to equip Nigerians with timely and accurate information to reduce their vulnerability, we have received reports indicating that traffickers have adopted new tactics to lure unsuspecting victims, predominantly to Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, and other West African nations.

""Under the guise of lucrative employment opportunities in gold mining and oil companies, victims are enticed with promises of monthly incomes as high as Nine Hundred Dollars ($900.00), which, as always, are blatant lies.""

""Victims are often instructed to bring up to Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira (N850,000) for documentation and other logistical expenses. Upon arrival at their destination, traffickers confiscate this money, along with the victims' phones and other personal belongings,"" the statement quoted her to have said.

""The targeted demographic includes male and female victims aged between 15 and 35 years old. They are typically trafficked through the waterways of Ode Jetty in Lagos en route to Benin Republic and other parts of the West African region. Some victims are also trafficked via land routes.""

Waziri-Azi, however, reiterated her earlier appeal to Nigerians to exercise caution, ask questions, and seek a second opinion before accepting any tempting offers.

""Do not allow desperation to cloud your judgment,"" the statement said.

""NAPTIP remains committed to combating human trafficking and protecting the rights and dignity of all Nigerians. For further information or to report suspected cases of human trafficking, please contact: 07030000203 or 627 (Only on the MTN Network).""",saharareporters.com,news,Sahara Reporters,,-0.3725490196078431,448989316,26,,

PHOENIX -- Public health officials in Arizona's most populous county on March 13 reported they confirmed a staggering 645 heat-associated deaths last year -- more than 50% higher than 2022 and another consecutive annual record in arid metro Phoenix.

The numbers in the preliminary report by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health alarmed officials in America's hottest big metro, raising concerns about how to better protect vulnerable groups such as homeless people and older adults from the blistering summer heat.

The report said two-thirds of the county's heat-related deaths in 2023 were people 50 years or older, and 71% were on days the National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning.

The heat-associated deaths confirmed in 2023 represented a huge jump from 2022, when there were 425 such deaths. There were 339 heat-associated deaths confirmed in 2021.

Colorado faces warmer, drier future, climate study suggests

No other major metropolitan area in the U.S. has reported such high heat-associated death figures or spends so much time tracking and studying them.

Maricopa County's public health officials since 2006 have tracked deaths in which environmental heat was the cause or a major contributing factor. The department uses information from preliminary death reports completed by the county's Office of the Medical Examiner, along with data in death certificates on file with the county's Office of Vital Registration.

Phoenix set a record in July with a 31-day streak of highs at or above 110 F.

Governor vetoes GOP legislature's border bill

PHOENIX -- An Arizona bill that would have made it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state through Mexico at any location other than a port of entry has been vetoed by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.

The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the measure late last month along party lines. Arizona has emerged as a popular illegal border crossing point, and the bill would have let local law enforcement arrest non-U.S. citizens who enter Arizona from anywhere but a lawful entrance point. A violation would be a top-tier misdemeanor - or a low-level felony for a second offense.

In a letter to Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen on March 4, Hobbs said the measure raised constitutional concerns and was expected to lead to costly litigation.

Supreme Court allows Texas to implement major immigration law

Federal law already prohibits the unauthorized entry of migrants into the United States. However, Republicans in Arizona and Texas say that the U.S. government is not doing enough and they need additional state powers.

Another proposal at the Legislature this year would bypass any possible veto by Hobbs by sending the measure straight to voters to decide as a ballot measure.

The proposal would require municipalities and counties that receive state money for welfare programs to use a federal employment verification database to check whether recipients are in the U.S. legally -- and if so, the recipients are to be removed from the program.

It also would make it a low-level felony for employers, who are already required by an earlier Arizona law to use the database when hiring new employees, to refuse to carry out their legal duty to use the database when they know an employee is not in the country legally.

SOUTH DAKOTALegislator calls for inquiry into Noam's dental promo

A Democratic legislator on March 13 called for an inquiry into South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem's trip to Texas for dental work and a promotional video in which she praises the doctors for giving her ""a smile I can be proud of and confident in.""

State Sen. Reynold Nesiba said he initially found the nearly five-minute video to be simply odd. Later he considered other questions and asked the Republican co-chairs of the Legislature's Government Operations & Audit Committee to put the matter on the panel's next meeting agenda in July for discussion and questions.

Nesiba said he wonders whether Noem used a state airplane or public funds for the Texas trip and whether the governor paid for the dental procedure or if it was discounted because of her video.

Noem's office did not respond to questions about the promotional video posted on March 11 to her personal account on X in which she praised the dentists and staff at Smile Texas, a cosmetic dental practice in the Houston area.

In the video, Noem complimented the dentists that recently ""gave me a smile I can be proud of and confident in."" Noem, who is seen as a potential vice-presidential pick by former President Donald Trump, identifies herself as the governor of South Dakota and includes clips of her speaking at a Republican Party event with Trump signs in the background.

South Dakota law bans gifts of over $100 from lobbyists to public officials and their immediate family. A violation is a misdemeanor punishable up to a year in jail and/or a $2,000 fine. The state attorney general's office declined to answer questions about whether the gift ban applies to people who are not registered lobbyists.

Paul Miskimins, a Republican former state legislator who practiced dentistry over 37 years in South Dakota, said he saw nothing wrong with Noem seeking care out of state, noting he had sought dental care from a friend in Canada. Miskimins added that celebrities often give testimonials about dental work, and he didn't see why a public official couldn't do the same.

KANSASStorm carrying 'gorilla hail' pelts corridor

ST. LOUIS -- Massive chunks of hail pelted parts of Kansas and Missouri on March 13, bringing traffic to a standstill along Interstate 70, as storms unleashed possible tornadoes and meteorologists urged residents to stay indoors.

There were three unconfirmed reports of tornadoes in Wabaunsee and Shawnee counties with reports of damaged structures, but no reports of injuries or homes damaged, according to meteorologist Matt Wolters with the National Weather Service's Topeka office.

There were reports of 4-inch hail, nearly softball-size, in the town of Wabaunsee and 3-inch hail in Geary County near Junction City and Fort Riley, Wolters said.

Colorado Supreme Court considers making it easier for late-filed home insurance claims to proceed

Descriptions of the hail ranged from the size of golf balls and apples, to softballs and baseballs.

Alex Sosnowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, previously said the predicted hail was deemed ""gorilla hail"" because it had the potential to be so big.

""Gorilla hail"" is a term coined by Reed Timmer, a storm chaser who calls himself an extreme meteorologist, Sosnowski said. In this case, the term might fit: Some hail from north-central Kansas into north-central Missouri could be as big as a baseball.

""When you get up to tennis ball, baseball-sized or God forbid softball-sized, that can do a tremendous amount of damage, and if you get hit in the head, that could be fatal,"" Sosnowski said.

Traffic came to a standstill for a time on part of Interstate 70 because of the falling hail, the National Weather Service said on X. Images of large hail chunks and at least one cracked windshield were shown on KSHB-TV.

NEW MEXICORoswell police have new out-of-this-world patches

Famous for being the spot where a spacecraft purportedly crashed in 1947, Roswell, New Mexico, has become a mecca for people fascinated by extraterrestrial phenomenon. So it's only fitting that the city's police force has uniform patches that are out of this world.

Unveiled on March 8, the new patches feature the official city logo of a flying saucer with a classic beam radiating downward to form the letter ""R."" The words ""Protect and Serve Those That Land Here"" form a circle and are separated by two tiny alien faces with large eyes.

Police Chief Lance Bateman said there had been discussions for a while about retiring the previous patch, which had served the department for more than 30 years. When he took office last summer, that was among the feedback he was getting from rank and file, so he pushed forward with the idea.

Employees submitted about a dozen designs, with most including some reference to UFOs and aliens. Top brass whittled that down to four finalists, and employees voted for the winner -- designed by Support Services Sgt. Trong Nguyen -- in January.

The new patch also incorporates New Mexico's official state symbol, which is based on the ancient Zia Pueblo symbol of the sun.

A decade ago, as a member of the San Antonio Spurs, Patty Mills tormented Heat fans with his sharpshooting to topple Miami in the 2014 NBA Finals - the final time the ""Big 3"" played together.

Flash forward to the present day and Mills is still tormenting Heat fans. Only now it comes as a member - not an opponent. But Mills' shooting struggles have more than put just the Heat's title aspirations in peril. If Mills can't ascend from his current slump, this could be his last time having a featured role on a playoff contender.

It doesn't matter how much postseason success he's enjoyed. In a league that's unapologetically ""What have you done for me lately?"" Mills' recent track record whimpers ""not much.""

Since making a Nets-high 227 three-pointers in 2021-22, he's struggled to make an impact. Last season for Brooklyn, he averaged 14.2 minutes - fewest since the 2012-2013 season - and shot 36.7% from three - worst since the 2014-15 season.

This past offseason, he was traded by the Nets to the Rockets to clear up cap space. Then he was sent to the Thunder, then the Hawks in another off-season deal. Before being waived by Atlanta on Feb. 29 this season, he had 36 DNPs (did not play). In the 19 games he did play in, Mills averaged 2.7 points in 10.6 minutes.

This is why Mills' current slump is so impactful. He can be forgiven for his lack of playing time since the 2021-22 season, but not for failing to capitalize when an opportunity was given. When he hits the market this offseason, playoff contenders could view him as an unreliable 36-year-old who can provide nothing more than wisdom.

Can you blame them?

Since an impressive debut for Miami, he's shot just 3-for-31 from three and averaged less than four points. Furthermore, his points (11.3) and three-point percentage (17.1%) per 36 minutes are both career lows.

In last Friday's 111-88 loss to the Pelicans, Mills played just 12 minutes, shot 2-for-7 from the field and 0-for-4 from three. Those shots were taken in the first eight minutes of the blowout.

This performance is particularly alarming for a few reasons. For starters, it was Mills' second straight game starting for the injured Duncan Robinson. This allowed him to do what he does best: drill three-pointers. But in his two starts, he missed 11 of his 12 three-point attempts.

Aware of Mills' current shooting slump, coach Erik Spoelstra told the Miami Herald before the Pelicans game, ""Patty is such a savvy veteran winning player that if you don't look past whatever the shooting numbers may be, you don't see all the nuances of how he helps.""

If that's the case, then why did he play Mills just four minutes in the second and third quarter Friday night?

The answer isn't nuanced. It's because Spoelstra knows Mills can't help the team if he's not making shots.

With just 12 regular-season games left, can Mills gain Spoelstra's trust? Or will he continue his plunge into irrelevancy? If the latter happens, it'll be a crushing finale to a highly impactful career - on and off the court.

As the first indigenous Australian to appear in the NBA Finals, he used his increased exposure to offer a voice to fellow indigenous Australians - a historically silenced and marginalized community.

And in a decade-long career with the Spurs, Mills ranks second all-time in made 3-pointers (1,220) and helped San Antonio make four Western Conference Finals, back-to-back NBA Finals and played a significant role in legendary head coach Gregg Popovich securing his fifth ring in 2014.

If Mills is worried he'll never reach those same heights, then he should reflect on a quote Popovich framed in the Spurs' locker room:

""When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow, it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it - but all that had gone before.""

Perseverance is essential right now.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, there would be no more jet fuel, gasoline or diesel. Internal combustion engine automobiles, buses, trucks, lorries and coaches would be stranded. Airplanes powered by jet fuel would be grounded. Freight and passenger rail powered by diesel would halt. People could not get to work; children could not get to school. The shipping industry, transporting both freight and passengers, would be devastated.

There would be no point calling emergency services. The majority of ambulances, fire engines, police cars, rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles would be stationary. Most phones and computers would also vanish as their plastic components derive from oil, so it would be a struggle to find a way of communicating with the emergency services anyway.

The construction sector would halt, as diesel powered vehicles would be stranded: excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, cranes, cement mixers, rollers and compact loaders would remain stationary. New homes or buildings could not be built or receive vital maintenance work.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, petroleum based-products would vanish with it. This would impact the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Aside from the supply chains disruption, the structure of lithium-ion batteries would be affected. A lithium-ion battery has four parts: an anode, cathode, electrolyte and a separator. Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene petroleum-based products. The petroleum-derived synthetic rubber used on car and bicycle tyres would cease to exist.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, food production would be devastated. Many of the vehicles necessary in agriculture ̶ tractors, mowers, combine harvesters, balers, sprayers and seeders ̶ would stop working. Food packaging necessary for storage and preservation would not be available. Petroleum coke, a by-product in oil refining, is used as a feedstock in manufacturing synthetic fertilizers, which are important in increasing crop yields. Food shortages and the knock on impacts would likely ensue.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, it would be catastrophic for health services everywhere. Staff would lack mobility, and essential supplies would be stranded. Beyond transportation, petroleum is an essential feedstock for pharmaceuticals, plastics and medical supplies.

Latex gloves, medical tubes, medical syringes, adhesives, some bandages, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, cleaning agents, prosthetics, artificial heart valves, resuscitation masks, stethoscopes, MRI scanners, insulin pens, infusion bags, medication packaging, face-masks, and Personal Protection Equipment are largely derived from petroleum-based materials. The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

It is difficult to conceive of a modern hospital without this range of essential petroleum-based products.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, the renewables industry would be impacted. The fibreglass, resin or plastic necessary for the construction of most wind turbines, would disappear. The ethylene used in the production of solar panels would vanish. Most of the mining vehicles ̶ large trucks, rotary drill rigs and rock drills ̶ necessary to extract the critical minerals upon which the production of solar photovoltaic plants, wind farms and EVs depend, would become stationary.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, homes would be transformed beyond recognition. There is the possibility roofs would collapse, for example, if bitumen was a key product. Other materials used in insulating homes would disappear. If you relied on heating oil to keep warm, that would go. The linoleum flooring and tiling would be impacted. Painting the walls would be a challenge. Furniture, pillows, rugs, curtains, dishes, cups and non-stick pans all are likely to be made from petroleum-derived products too.

It would be a challenge to stay clean or keep homes clean, if oil disappeared tomorrow. Laundry detergent and dish detergents usually derive from petroleum-based products. Soap, toothpaste, hand-lotion, deodorant, shampoo, shaving cream, eyeglasses, contact lenses, combs, brushes; all normally contain petroleum-derived products.

It would be a struggle to get anywhere, as the asphalt that paves roads and footpaths would vanish.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, millions of jobs would be lost. Tax revenues would be depleted. Industrial production would crimp. Economic growth would go into reverse. The plight of the fuel poor would be worsened.

This is not even the full list of everything that would be impacted, in such an unthinkable scenario.

Yet, despite these realities, there are calls saying 'Just stop oil,' 'Keep it in the ground,' or 'don't invest in new oil and gas projects.'

Of course, everybody wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced. OPEC believes that technological solutions and efficiency improvements can play a vital role. The oil industry is already proactive in this regard.

We need to be cautious of endangering the present, in the name of saving the future. It is important we all fully understand the immense benefits that oil, and the petroleum products derived from it, continue to provide to people and nations across the world.",realnewsmagazine.net,news,Realnews Magazine,,-0.2941176470588235,448988802,1,https://realnewsmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-693.png,

Last year may prove to have been a pivotal year in the history of the energy transition. Tellingly, 2023 was also the hottest year to date on record, and two trends in energy demand speak to this state of affairs.

The first relates to wind. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a report on 18 March that orders for wind turbines hit a record in 2023, ""... with 155 gigawatts (GW) procured for the year, an increase of 16GW from 2022... As both China and Western markets broke records for order intake, annual investment reached an estimated $83-billion.""

Overall, global investment into the green energy transition in 2023 surged 17% from 2022 to almost $1.8-trillion, according to research provider BloombergNEF - also a record. Coal also had a record year, defying the prophets of its imminent doom.

According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA's) latest annual report on coal, demand for the fossil fuel in 2023 was expected to have reached a historic high of just more than 8.5 billion tonnes, a 1.4% increase over the previous peak scaled in 2022.

But the IEA forecasts that 2023 will be the year of ""peak coal"", and it's downhill from here.

""Overall, we expect global coal demand to drop in 2024 and plateau through 2026, even in the absence of governments announcing and implementing stronger clean energy and climate policies,"" the IEA forecast. ""A turning point for coal is clearly on the horizon.""

What is emerging is a tale of two coal markets. Its use in advanced economies is set to plunge at an accelerated pace, while it will remain robust for a while in a handful of big emerging markets.

""India, Indonesia and other emerging and developing economies are expected to rely on coal to power strong economic growth, despite commitments to accelerate the deployment of renewables and other low-emissions technologies,"" the IEA report said.

""By contrast... we do not see a major risk of coal use rising again among advanced economies. Coal power plants are being regularly shuttered in these economies, and industrial coal consumption is set to decline owing to weak industrial output, improved efficiency and increased switching to other fuels.""

And because of the winds of change symbolised by the rise of turbines and other renewable energy sources, this is a trend that looks set in stone.

""We have seen declines in global coal demand a few times, but they were brief and caused by extraordinary events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Covid-19 crisis. This time appears different, as the decline is more structural, driven by the formidable and sustained expansion of clean energy technologies,"" said Keisuke Sadamori, IEA director of energy markets and security.

China, as always, is key.

""...[The] pace of economic growth in China and its coal use in the coming years is subject to uncertainty. The country's economy is undergoing major structural changes as it reaches the end of infrastructure-led, energy-intensive growth, but the speed at which it changes gears and continues to expand clean energy capacity will have a significant influence on the outlook for coal.""

As already mentioned, 2023 was also the hottest year on record, which would make it a poignant marker for the fossil fuel and its historical impact. Its use has been clearly linked by science to rapid climate change, which is why wind turbine demand - fuelled by mounting concerns about our blazing planet - also reached a record last year.

Where does all of this leave South Africa's coal industry?

Like their global peers, South African coal producers reaped rich earnings after coal prices soared to record prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Coal mining companies have paid back debts, increased dividends and buybacks, and retained some cash. Diversified miners have often channelled coal profits towards other commodities as growing demand tied to the energy transition is expected to drive up their prices,"" the IEA said.

This global trend has been reflected in South Africa, where major coal producers recently reported their 2023 results.

Thungela announced a R500-million share buyback and paid dividends amounting to 41% of free cash flow. Exxaro announced a special dividend and had the capacity to do so, with net cash at the end of December of almost R15-billion.

The companies reported lower earnings on falling prices, but they were still in a position to reward shareholders. One imagines they may also be keeping cash on hand, as they face a potential class action suit launched by Richard Spoor over occupational lung diseases afflicting coal miners.

And both are on diversification drives. Thungela's is geographical for now: In 2023 it acquired Australian coal producer Ensham. That provides proximity to the Asian markets, where the IEA still sees growing coal demand for now. It also reduces exposure to the risks inherent to South Africa such as the logistics, power and crime crises.

Exxaro is focused on shaking up its commodity mix, with an eye to expanding into green metals such as copper, manganese and lithium.

And unlisted coal producer Seriti Resources has a renewable energy arm, Seriti Green, which is focused on wind power. Seriti Green is building South Africa's largest wind farm in Mpumalanga, which will generate 155MW of power. That is the way the winds are blowing.

Cash generated by coal these days is increasingly going back to shareholders or into other commodities or renewable energy. Meanwhile, banks are increasingly reluctant to finance new coal projects but are falling over themselves to fund renewable energy initiatives.

The writing is on the wall and 2023 may go down as a pivot point in this history. DM",dailymaverick.co.za,news,Daily Maverick,Ed Stoddard,0.1294117647058823,448988630,1,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-73870230-copy.jpg?w=1280,eng-9418993

But the Heat needs Swider around these days.

Currently without three of its top three-point shooters -- Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Duncan Robinson -- because of injuries, Swider's quality three-point shooting is not a luxury anymore.

""This is what a two-way [contract] is for, for moments like this when Duncan is out and Tyler is out,"" Swider said ahead of Sunday night's matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Kaseya Center.

Most of Swider's playing time this season has come in the G League with the Heat's developmental affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce, as part of his two-way contract that limits how many NBA games he can be active for. But Swider made the most of a rare opportunity to play extended NBA minutes for the Heat a few days ago.

As the Heat struggled to make threes against the New Orleans Pelicans' zone defense on Friday without the shooting of Herro, Love and Robinson on the court, Swider entered the game in the second quarter and made his first two shots from three-point range. He ended up setting new career-highs in points (14) and threes made (four) in Friday's loss.

""He is a great, great shooter,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Swider. ""He really is. He's elite with what he does and I think his stints in Sioux Falls have really impacted winning. That matters. Then it's just a matter of the fit, the timing and the opportunities with us.""

Swider, 24, has proven he's an elite shooter during his G League opportunities this season. Among the 32 players in the G League who entered Sunday averaging eight or more three-point attempts per game, Swider holds the second-best three-point percentage in the developmental league.

Swider has shot an eye-opening 45.8 percent on 10 three-point attempts per game with the Skyforce this season.

But prior to Friday's 4-of-6 three-point shooting performance with the Heat, Swider had shot just 5 of 19 (26.3 percent) from behind the arc in his limited NBA playing time this season. He believes lack of rhythm during some short on-court stints played a role in some of those misses, as he entered Sunday a combined 7 of 13 (53.8 percent) from three-point range during the only two NBA games he logged double-digit minutes in this season.

""I think if you were to pick the two games that I played 20-plus minutes, I've over 40 percent in those games,"" Swider said. ""I think rhythm is a big part of it, but also just being ready for the moment. I think as a shooter, you can use rhythm as an excuse, but also just being ready for the moment and coming in and making those shots.""

Swider's combination of size at 6-foot-8 and standout three-point shooting makes him an intriguing developmental prospect. It's also a useful skill set to have around with the three-point shooting of Herro, Love and Robinson currently unavailable.

""I think the game is starting to slow down for Cole,"" Heat center Bam Adebayo said. ""He's starting to understand that he can tell other people what to do. He can tell somebody to run a different play for him. It comes with confidence. I feel like his confidence is starting to go in the right direction and that's obviously through behind the scenes of practice, pre-practice, him getting his work in, obviously talking to some of the older vets like Patty [Mills] and obviously the guy he's emulating in Duncan.""

Swider, who went undrafted out of Syracuse in 2022 and spent last season on a two-way deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, is not eligible to play for the Heat in the playoffs this season as part of the limitations that come with being on a two-way contract. But he's ready to help the Heat during the final weeks of the regular season if he's called on.

""The conversations are always just stay ready,"" Swider said of the message he has received from the Heat's coaching staff. ""Whatever that role is, obviously, I'm going to try and do that to the best of my ability. But there haven't been a lot of conversations. It's always been about staying ready when I come here and I suit up.""

Al Ghais, in an interview with KUNA, said oil would continue to play an ""important and vital"" role in international markets for decades to come. ""Abandoning it is not easy,"" he added. He said oil occupies an important part in human life. ""Oil and its products are used in many of the vital daily activities of people regardless of their locations, nationalities, jobs or interests, such as transportation, travel, energy production and manufacturing,"" added Al Ghais.

Al Ghais highlighted the abundance of oil and added that ""oil is also easy to extract, refine and transport. All these factors have made oil extremely important since it was discovered decades ago. It plays nowadays a vital role in the global economy and it has become an integral part of our daily life. We also depend on it due to its supplies being secured. ""There have been many voices in recent years calling for abandoning oil under the excuse of protecting the environment,"" he said, and warned of the severe consequences that the world could face if oil production would be stopped. Therefore, he said, OPEC has launched awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of oil and its vital role in our daily life in various languages, including English, Arabic, German, Spanish and Persian. Al Ghais, commenting on sectors that would be affected if the world stopped using oil, said the impact would extend to road, sea and air transport, ambulances, food production, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment. ""If oil disappeared, this would also affect the production of renewable energy, such as manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels, as their production is linked to oil products,"" he said, adding that ""Lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars would also be affected."" Al Ghais highlighted further that ""we would also be unable to produce soaps and toothpastes.

""It would also have catastrophic impacts on millions of people losing their jobs. It would also put manufacturing worldwide to a halt, slow global economic growth and worsen energy poverty in many countries as millions won't be able to secure the energy they need including electricity,"" he added. Currently, around 2.3 billion people still lack access to clean cooking fuels and oil can play a role in providing energy to meet these critical needs, he noted. Al Ghais called for encouraging development of the oil industry and the investments it requires, while improving the industry's environmental credentials. ""This is OPEC's message to the world,"" he stated.

OPEC continues to receive support and praise for its reasonable calls and efforts to find realistic solutions amidst false information and biased narratives that lack any scientific merit calling for abandoning oil, he said. There have been, he added, reports that oil demand would peak by 2030, ""which are regrettably based on ideologies"" pushing for abandoning oil and gas in general. Reports by OPEC and international energy consultancies affirm the important and critical role of oil in the decades to come because of the anticipated growth in world's population, which is expected to reach 9.5 billion by 2045, of which the majority will happen in developing countries, said Al Ghais. He said that OPEC projects global oil demand to reach 116 million barrels per day (bpd) in its base scenario and 120 million bpd in one of its alternative scenarios by 2045, and noted there should be adequate investments to provide for ""these huge needs for energy and oil. ""In order to secure the necessary oil supplies, we need to invest around USD 14 trillion in the different sectors the oil industry by 2045,"" he said, which would support enhancing energy security and the development of technologies that help in reducing emissions. Al Ghais noted that calls to stop using oil has caused panic and confusion. ""We heard projections during the COVID-19 pandemic that global oil demand had reached its peak and it would soon start dropping.

Yet, just days ahead of the anniversary, Perenco has once again hit headlines. This time, it was for a fatal fire at one of its oil platforms off the coast of Gabon.

So, on Saturday 23 March local climate activists held a protest march to the site of Perenco's onshore oil field operations near Poole. There, activists weren't holding back in calling out Perenco's well-oiled PR spin to the corporate media - namely the BBC. Crucially, they showed the public broadcaster why shouldn't so readily buy into the fossil fuel corporation's narrative, hook, line, and sinker.

On March 26 2023, Perenco spilled 200 barrels of 'reservoir fluid' into Poole Harbour.

It leaked from a corroded pipeline situated under Poole Harbour. Perenco caused the spill at its Wytch Farm onshore oilfield site at Studland, Dorset.

Perenco shut down the pipeline in response to the incident. Following this, the company mobilised the local harbour commissioners and the oil spill response teams to contain the leak. It continued remediation works at the site until January 2024.

As the Canary noted at the time:

The harbour is adjacent to multiple biodiverse protected sites. For example, Poole Rocks Marine Conservation Zone lies just east of the harbour entrance, and is home to more than 360 marine species.

So, a year on from prospective environmental catastrophe, activists marched to the oil field to call for an end to the Anglo-French firm's extractive operations near key conservation hotspots.

Extinction Rebellion Bournemouth, Christchurch, and Poole (XR BCP) coordinated the action which saw campaigners from across the South West converge on Perenco's oil field facilities.

Activists from Extinction Rebellion Wimborne and Purbeck, alongside East Dorset Friends of the Earth (FoE), Bournemouth and Poole Greenpeace, and other groups turned up to demand the company cease oil extraction in Dorset.

Around 70 protesters gathered with drums, placards, and flags two miles from Perenco's onshore site. Before setting off, an activist led the group in protest song:

They began via road from Corfe Castle, raising banners that read: ""Perenco out"":

For an hour, activists slow-marched across 3km of lowland heathland and birch-pine woods, where Perenco carries out its oil extraction, purposely out of sight from nearby communities in Poole and Dorset. As they went, they were singing, drumming, and shouting for the oil company to end its drilling at the site.

On arrival at Wytch Farm, they blocked the main entry gates for another hour:

Then, activists held speeches and picnics against the backdrop of Perenco's entrance, where behind around 70 operating wells are extracting oil beyond:

The protest marked XR BCP's sixth demonstration against the fossil fuel corporation since it caused the spill.

Despite early concerns after the incident, two new reports have suggested that Perenco managed to avoid causing long-term ecological disaster.

On Tuesday 19 March, local authorities and environmental regulators published impact reports on the spill. Bournemouth, Christchurch, and Poole Council (BCP), and Dorset County Council (DCC) commissioned the first report.

This found that there were negligible to minimal impacts on the local community's health, the economy, and the environment. However, it did acknowledge that the financial costs did disproportionately fall on small and medium enterprises in the area. Particularly, the spill hurt local aquaculture and fishing businesses.

In tandem with this, the Environment Agency and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), with other agencies, released its summary assessment of the environmental impacts. Notably, the report reviewed how the spill had affected shellfish, birds, seagrass, and seabed habitats.

Overall, it concluded that:

The investigation and monitoring activity undertaken to date indicates that there has been limited impact from the incident on the wider Poole Harbour area. The key impacts have been on the activity in and around Poole Harbour in the first two weeks after the incident when fishing and shellfish activities were restricted.

From an ecological perspective there does not appear to have been a material impact on the wider Poole Harbour area from data and observations to date.

In other words, it determined that the spill had caused limited, short-term damage to marine life in the harbour.

However, a protester pointed out that despite the purportedly minimised harm, Perenco had only just concluded the spill remediation works in January. Property Manager and XR BCP activist Greg Lambe said:

what damage would a larger spill cause and how long would it take to remove - if this were even possible, if this relatively small spill took 10 to 11 months?

Predominantly, the activists at the demonstration weren't convinced that this would be a one-time incident.

Long-time East Dorset Friends of the Earth campaigner Martin Price has been scrutinising Wytch Farm's activities since the site opened in 1979. He told the Canary that while he acknowledged that the reports showed that Perenco ""acted as quickly as it could to deal with the problem once it occurred"", he argued that:

On the other hand, it has caused a huge amount of damage in a very restricted area and I think one of the problems is that it could happen again.

In particular, Price emphasised that:

They say it won't happen again - this particular problem won't happen again, perhaps, but if a similar or different problem happens elsewhere, it could be much more devastating to the environment of Poole Harbour and the surrounding area.

Moreover, he said that this was due to ""ailing, ageing infrastructure"". Specifically, Price referenced the site's former owner, BP. The oil and gas giant sold its Wytch Farm assets to Perenco in 2011. It did so in response to leaking at least 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, in its infamous Deepwater Horizon disaster.

Price explained to the Canary that it sold Wytch Farm:

because it was becoming uneconomic for them. Now, if a big multinational feels it's uneconomic, then they're basically handing they're problem onto somebody else. With the best will in the world, with the best investment in the world, Perenco really can't afford to keep this going for longer.

In essence, it decided to sell off older, less profitable assets in the UK to finance the spiralling costs of its clean-up. As a result, Perenco now operates these end-of-life oil wells.

Of course, it is precisely this ageing infrastructure that campaigners contend is the issue.

In fact, before it sold off Wytch Farm to Perenco, BP also caused a leak at the site. This forced the company to shut down its operations there for two months in early 2011. Fellow East Dorset Friends of the Earth campaigner Angela Pooley told the Daily Echo at the time that the leak towards the end of 2010:

should be a wake-up call to us all to remind us of the potential for disaster in Dorset.

Fast forward 13 years later, and of course, the major incident in the harbour unfortunately vindicated Pooley's warning. Environmental campaigners have continued to echo this since the 2023 spill. As the Canary previously reported, local Green Party politician and environmental activist Chris Rigby said at the time of the incident that it had been an ""accident waiting to happen"".

In particular, Rigby was citing Perenco's pollution record since it took over the onshore oil field. Crucially, Perenco has presided over ten pollution incidents at the site between 2011 and 2020.

Now, the Canary can reveal that Perenco has reported another incident since the spill took place in March 2023.

Through a Freedom of Information request to the Environment Agency, we found that Perenco had breached its permit conditions. More specifically, the company reported exceeding the limits of nitrogen oxide emissions it is licensed to emit to the air from the gas engines on site.

While comparatively minor, the fault and resulting pollution perhaps show that even on high alert after a major spill, the company can't guarantee further failures - with all the potentially hazardous consequences for people and nature nearby.

On top of calling for Perenco to leave the Wytch Farm site, the activists drew parallels with its operations in the Global South.

As the Canary previously outlined, the company is responsible for a litany of environmental and social harms across the planet. So unsurprisingly, less than a week before its Poole Harbour spill year anniversary the company hit headlines for a fatal accident in Gabon.

On Wednesday 20 March, a fire on a Perenco-operated offshore rig off the coast of the central African nation killed five workers. A further worker is still missing.

XR BCP member Helen Nicol told the Canary that the accident Perenco is responsible for in Gabon made their protest ""especially important"". She said that the spill in Poole Harbour last year had been eye-opening:

because initially we were focused incredibly locally and then we started looking further afield. We realised what was happening in the DRC, what was happening in Peru, Ecuador, Gabon, and the Caribbean - and it just seems that Perenco have a policy of disregard for their workers, for the lands that they're based in, and for the whole world.

If they can cut a corner, they will cut a corner - they're not safe, they're not safe in Poole Harbour, and they're not safe anywhere else.

Again, she attributed this to Perenco's business model. Specifically, she referenced how it buys up older oil and gas fields from other companies:

The strategy they have of taking end of life oil wells and then trying to drag the very last drop of profit out of it, regardless of the consequences to the surrounding landscape and the people who live around them and the people who work for them is disgusting - and they need to stop.

A representative of Gabon's space agency has previously corroborated this concern. The representative told media outlet Investigate Europe that despite causing pollution in offshore Atlantic sites:

They kept on pumping anyway, even though their aging system requires huge maintenance work

Given the latest incident in Gabon, Nicol therefore said that the group would continue:

to shine a light on their practices, and keep highlighting the fact that they are not a safe pair of hands.

Ultimately, the groups want to put a stop to its risky business in Poole and beyond. Activists see Perenco's Wytch Farm as a significant first target.

East Dorset Friends of the Earth Martin Price told the Canary that the Climate Change Committee had been clear:

the government's main advisor is saying we must totally divest from fossil fuels within the next 16 years. Now, if we're to do that, we have to start now.

As such, Price argued:

Where better to start than in one of the most environmentally sensitive, one of the most rewarding in terms of international status sites in England, and possibly even in parts of Western Europe.

In stark contrast however, Perenco has also shown no signs of slowing down at the site.

In 2023, it drilled a new bore from an existing well. Dorset County Council licensed this particular well bore to pump out oil until December 2031. What's more, for 2024 alone, the company plans to submit applications to drill five new wells on-site.

Moreover, it has made early rumblings of its intention to use Wytch Farm for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS is a notorious fossil fuel industry palatability ploy to make continued extraction appear socially and environmentally compatible.

At the end of the day then, it's just another fossil fuel company gaslighting communities and nature into oblivion. Extending the life of its oil and gas business comes over protecting the lives of people and the planet every time. But the local climate community in Dorset will continue to mobilise against it.

At this latest protest, groups successfully held the profiteering company's feet to the fire. Crucially, activists articulated that the only way to truly guarantee ""no repeat"" of a spill like the incident in Poole Harbour, is ""Perenco out"", in the UK and everywhere, for good.",thecanary.co,news,The Canary,Hannah Sharland,-0.1215686274509804,448986757,1,https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240323_134637-1-2.jpg,

However, this year, the soaring summer heat, combined with the upcoming General Elections in April and May, has cast a shadow on the travel plans of holiday-makers.

Consequently, there has been a noticeable decline in the uptake of summer tour packages. The effects of elections are already being seen in Mysuru which is seeing a 50 percent decline in tourists.

Traditionally, immediately following the conclusion of children's board exams in March, tourists, particularly families, flock to both urban centres like Mysuru and nearby tourist destinations. However, tour operators have reported a significant decrease in bookings to and from Mysuru compared to previous years, largely attributed to the looming elections.

Many individuals who would typically embark on leisure trips during the summer months are opting to remain at home instead. Especially this year, students in eighth, ninth and tenth standard are taking up public examinations. As such, parents have put off the travel plans.

Even after the conclusion of exams, the election season kicks in with Government officers and employees being put on election duty. They cannot leave their headquarters even on a Sunday without permission from the District Election Office. Also, tourists are desisting from visiting places as the Election authorities have set up check-posts all over to curb the violation of the Model Code of Conduct.

Only Chamundi Hill popular

This weekend, except Chamundi Hill, which continues to draw hundreds of local visitors, all other tourist destinations in Mysuru, including the Zoo, Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) Dam, Karanji Lake, Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Srirangapatna, Melukote, Tipu Palace, Nimishamba Temple and Talakadu, are experiencing a significant decline in tourist footfall.

The Mysore Palace, for instance, typically welcomes over 5,000 tourists daily. However, this weekend, the number of visitors barely reached 2,500. Hospitality industry stakeholders told Star of Mysore that only 30 percent of the hotel rooms are booked now and 70 percent of the rooms are vacant.

Traditional modes of transportation like Tonga rides, as well as the sale of handicrafts and other locally made products, have witnessed a noticeable decrease in demand.

Additionally, the operations of buses managed by the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) have experienced a decline in the number of trips taken.

This notable decrease in tourist influx is indicative of the current trend where many visitors are opting to stay away from popular attractions, possibly due to factors such as the ongoing elections or concerns related to the prevailing heat.

Measures at check-posts

The anticipated chaos surrounding the upcoming elections has even resulted in the postponement of short and day-long leisure trips for many individuals.

This delay is primarily attributed to the stringent security measures implemented at check-posts, where vehicles are subjected to lengthy queues and thorough inspections for unaccounted cash and illicit liquor.

At these check-posts, every vehicle undergoes meticulous scrutiny, with authorities recording the details of passengers, including their names, addresses, destination and expected date and time of return. The rigorous checking procedures, aimed at ensuring safety and security during the election period, have inadvertently deterred tourists from embarking on visits to various destinations.

As a result, individuals bitten by the wanderlust bug during the summer season are opting for a more cautious approach, choosing to stay within the comfort of their homes until the political scene and climate stabilise.",starofmysore.com,news,Star of Mysore,,0.04313725490196085,448986203,1,https://starofmysore.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/news-5-1-tourists-mysore-palace.jpg,

At the top of the information pyramid about this product, stands out the rigorous European regulations that regulate the labeling of olive oil and that guarantee that consumers have all the information necessary to make an informed decision.

This regulatory framework requires that liquid gold labels include very important details, such as the category of the oil, its origin and, in the case of certain products, quality seals indicating its origin and production method.

When choosing olive oil, it is crucial to understand the differences between the four main categories: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Virgin Olive Oil, Olive Oil and Olive Pomace Oil. The distinction between these categories lies in the extraction method and treatment of the oil. The extra virgin and virgin oils are of the highest quality, obtained directly from the olives through mechanical procedures, without chemical treatments.

The labeling also reveals the origin of the oil, a mandatory aspect for virgin and extra virgin oils. This information helps consumers know the origin of the product, whether from a member country of the European Union or outside, providing an additional degree of transparency and allowing more conscious purchasing decisions.

The Protected Designation of Origin (DOP) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) seals are indicators of the highest quality and authenticity. These seals not only certify that the oil meets high production standards, but also confirm its specific geographical origin, offering consumers additional assurance about what they are purchasing. The DOP seal, for example, ensures that the entire production process takes place within a given region, from cultivation to packaging, while the PGI can be applied to products that meet only part of this criterion.

Prof Fatima Waziri - Azi, Director-General of NAPTIP, revealed this alarming trend at the Agency's Headquarters in Abuja while discussing emerging trends in human trafficking for the year 2024.

Adekoye Vincent, Communication Officer, NAPTIP in a Statement revealed that the fictitious job offers to neighboring West African countries constitute another form of exploitation.

In recent times, NAPTIP has redoubled its efforts through enhanced partnership, collaboration, diligent prosecution, and extensive awareness campaigns aimed at bolstering its operations, resulting in a significant increase in convictions of human traffickers.

Prof. Fatima Waziri - Azi emphasized, ""As part of our comprehensive enlightenment strategies to equip Nigerians with timely and accurate information to reduce their vulnerability, we have received reports indicating that traffickers have adopted new tactics to lure unsuspecting victims, predominantly to Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, and other West African nations.""

She continued, ""Under the guise of lucrative employment opportunities in gold mining and oil companies, victims are enticed with promises of monthly incomes as high as Nine Hundred Dollars ($900.00), which, as always, are blatant lies.""

""Victims are often instructed to bring up to Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira (N850,000) for documentation and other logistical expenses. Upon arrival at their destination, traffickers confiscate this money, along with the victims' phones and other personal belongings.""

""The targeted demographic includes male and female victims aged between 15 and 35 years old. They are typically trafficked through the waterways of Ode Jetty in Lagos en-route to Benin Republic and other parts of the West African region. Some victims are also trafficked via land routes.""

Prof. Fatima Waziri - Azi reiterated her earlier appeal to Nigerians, stating, ""I urge you to exercise caution, ask questions, and seek a second opinion before accepting any tempting offers. Do not allow desperation to cloud your judgment.""

Check out our latest analysis for Natural Gas Services Group

While Natural Gas Services Group made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.

Over the last three years Natural Gas Services Group has grown its revenue at 15% annually. That's pretty nice growth. Broadly speaking, this solid progress may well be reflected by the healthy share price gain of 27% per year over three years. It's hard to value pre-profit businesses, but it seems like the market has become a lot more optimistic about this one! It would be worth thinking about when profits will flow, since that milestone will attract more attention.

Oyintiloye, who made the appeal while speaking with newsmen on Sunday in Osogbo, said the cost of cooking gas was becoming unbearable for the masses.

The APC chieftain said although the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Ekperikpe Ekpo, on February 22, announced that the Federal Government had asked LPG producers to stop exporting the commodity, but the decision was yet to yield positive results.

He said this might be as a result of LPG producers secretly exporting the product or the ban has not been fully implemented.

Oyintiloye, a former member of the defunct APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), noted that it was alarming that the cost of refilling a 12.5kg cylinder in many parts of the country now costs between N17,500 and N18,000.

Oyintiloye, a former lawmaker, urged the President to take drastic measures to crash the price of the product in the interest of the masses.

He said that as a result of the exorbitant prices, many LPG users who could not afford the price were gradually shifting to solid fuels like charcoal and firewood.

Oyintiloye said that the shift to the use of charcoal and firewood by the masses could lead to climate change and its adverse effects such as deforestation, desertification and soil degradation that could lead to erosion.

According to him, the use of solid fuel can also pollute the air with carbon monoxide emitted from solid fuel, which is harmful to human beings.

""This will in turn pose serious danger to the respiratory organ, fatigue, headaches, confusion, and dizziness to the human system due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain, thereby reducing the overall well-being of people.

""Human beings depend on green plants for our daily supply of oxygen while giving back carbon dioxide to the plants.

""In an attempt to substitute clean cooking gas to firewood and charcoal by cutting down green trees, this will affect human survival because there will be no adequate oxygen in the blood system,"" he said.

He said that while the masses were struggling to look for what to eat, the means of cooking should not be made difficult for them.

""I know Mr President has a listening ear and he will do something urgent about this matter.

""The announcement by the petroleum minister(state) on the ban on the exportation of the product is a good one, but it has not started having any positive effects on the masses.

""The fuel subsidy removal is biting hard on the people and the electricity supply is not stable.

""All relevant and critical stakeholders must join hands with the President to tackle the challenges in the gas industry,"" he said.

Oyintiloye, however, commended Tinubu on his proactive steps in stabilising the Naira against the United States dollar.

He said the gradual and steady appreciation of the Naira against the dollar in the last few days was commendable.

He said the warning by the Presidency to currency speculators to desist from unpatriotic acts against the Naira was also timely and necessary.

Oyintiloye said with the patience and absolute support of the President, the economic challenges the country is going through will be a thing of the past.

""I want to commend the President on his tireless efforts in putting the economy of the country on the right path.

""With patience, endurance, prayers and support for the President, we will come out stronger from these challenges,"" he said.

While the resources minister, Madeleine King, had labelled claims she was taking over environmental approvals a ""conspiracy theory"", widespread opposition from the Greens, the crossbench, First Nations activists and environmental groups spurred an informal Labor pro-climate group into action.

The relatively innocuous sounding offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment (safety and other measures) bill sailed through Labor caucus on 13 February.

But buried in a bill ostensibly about worker safety were amendments stating that approved offshore gas projects would be taken to be compliant with environmental laws even if they wouldn't otherwise be - an effective override.

The bill's explanatory memorandum said this is needed to ""provide certainty to stakeholders"" that existing approvals will ""remain effective"" in the event of changes to environmental laws.

The Greens were the first to raise the alarm, with their concerns backed by Indigenous activists and environmental groups who argue the bill responds to industry pressure to water down consultation requirements after two high-profile court cases.

Mardudhunera woman Raelene Cooper won her challenge against Woodside's seismic blasting for the controversial $16.5bn Scarborough gas development due to inadequate consultation, and a Tiwi Islander challenge against Santos's $5.8bn Barossa offshore gas project succeeded in 2022, slowing down the approval process.

Fears over the bill could be justified after the West Australian revealed Santos had warned King the offshore gas approvals regime was in a ""dire"" state a week after the federal court overturned Woodside's approval.

King insists the bill itself does not change the process of assessments or water down environmental standards.

But when combined with her powers to change the consultation requirements and the fact offshore gas approvals are not in the environment minister's portfolio, it's easy to see how it could achieve just that.

The bill was expected to pass parliament with bipartisan support after the Coalition demanded clarification of consultation requirements to restart offshore gas investment as one of four demands to pass the petroleum resource rent tax.

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, insists clarifying consultation requirements and environmental approval changes are happening ""for their own good reasons, not as a bargaining chip"".

On 29 February the bill was referred to a snap parliamentary inquiry, which held just one five-hour hearing, adding to crossbench fears the fix was in.

At the inquiry, the resources department explained that since 2014 projects only needed approval from the environment or resources department.

The bill ""simply allows flexibility for improvements to the law without automatically introducing that burdensome and bureaucratic process"" of requiring approval from both, according to Robert Jeremenko, the head of the industry and resources department's oil and gas division.

The Senate economics committee reported back on Friday, with the Labor and Coalition majority recommending the bill pass. The Greens, David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe dissented.

Earlier in the week, the government pulled its own bill from the notice paper, a sign that behind the scenes things were a little more complicated.

The assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, Macnamara MP Josh Burns, Fremantle MP Josh Wilson and other Northern Territory and Victoria-based MPs lobbied internally for changes. The Labor Environment Action Network wrote to the government on Friday.

King suggested she was open to amendments, as Plibersek pushed to prevent the override becoming a loophole that would exempt offshore gas from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC).

Amendments to be introduced this week reinsert an effective power of veto for Plibersek, through a requirement that both the resources minister and then the environment minister must be satisfied that any changes to consultation rules comply with the ecologically sustainable development principles in the EPBC Act.

The government will also add a 12-month sunset clause, by which time Plibersek's EPBC reforms should be done. This should prevent a future Coalition government further streamlining offshore gas approval consultation.

The bill is listed in the House early this week, and in the Senate on Wednesday, allowing it to be passed by Easter.

Despite the marginal improvement that will need two ministers to change consultation requirements, this is still a Labor bill designed to streamline approval for offshore gas and more likely to pass with Coalition votes than the crossbench.

On Thursday Pocock said he is concerned when it comes to climate action that ""rather than working with the crossbench the Australian people delivered, Labor seems to want to do a deal with the Coalition, who were voted out"" on the basis of climate ""inaction"".

""The crossbench stands ready to act in the best interests of Australians, not the best interests of the fossil fuel industry.

""We know ... it's played an important part in our economy but it's time to transition out of [fossil fuels]. We're not seeing that - [it's] really worrying.""

The Albanese government seems determined to govern from the political centre. And on issues like political donations, religious discrimination and offshore gas consultation, it now seems that amounts to seeking opposition support rather than crossbench deals or amendments.

Higher gas prices are driven by deliberate policy choices.,"Gas prices in California are the highest in the nation, and the state recently announced its policies are about to drive them even higher.

A recent Los Angeles Times editorial completely misrepresented the root causes and attempted to cast blame in the wrong place. This is the same tactic the governor and Legislature have been using to try to displace the blame, but the facts speak for themselves. For example, it is a FACT that many factors impact California's gas prices, but policy choices made by the governor, Legislature, and state regulators have made California's gas and diesel prices the highest in the nation.

As of March 11, 2024, state and local governments collected $1.24/gallon in taxes and fees -- 27 percent of the total cost of a gallon of gas goes to state and local agencies and another 18 cents above this goes to federal taxes. These aren't industry talking points; these are FACTS provided by the California Energy Commission tracked and monitored over the past 20-plus years. The California government collects a 58-cent state excise tax, 12 cent per gallon low carbon fuel standard cost, 54 cents for cap and trade and other environmental fees, 10 cents for state and local sales tax, and a 2-cent state underground storage fee.

How do the governor and editorial writers at the Times justify this? Especially because gasoline taxes are one of the most regressive taxes in the state and are directly responsible for our high cost of living and high inflation rate. To offset this fact, the governor and Legislature argue that the money goes to pay for environmental programs.

While that may have been the Legislature and regulators' original intent, these environmental fees are unrestricted profits to the state and can be used for whatever purpose the governor and Legislature wish, regardless of their connection to the environment. This year, the governor plans to take the profit he's made off of all California drivers' gasoline and diesel purchases to backfill the state's general fund budget.

We all agree we must address climate change, but we must balance ambition with reality, especially cost. According to a recent report for the Center for Jobs and the Economy California's aggressive climate laws and regulations have done no better and, in some years, worse than the rest of the nation, but they are increasing the price of electricity, fuels and natural gas. Other states have produced actual emissions reductions by pursuing alternative and generally less costly approaches.

Meanwhile, regulators and the governor are doubling down on their expensive policies that are driving up the cost of living. According to the Energy Commission, currently, our unique gas adds 15 cents to every gallon sold in California. In just a few months, CARB expects that cost could increase by another 47 cents per gallon. Eventually, this program could increase by a total of $1.83/gallon -- and both are CARB estimates in constant 2021 dollars that do not account for inflation-on top of the other environmental fees and taxes that are already the highest in the nation.

At a time when Californians are paying more for electricity, housing, food, and other necessities they cannot afford a 50-cent increase per gallon, let alone nearly two dollars more.

The bottom line is that California's policy choices are driving the high cost at the pump, and they're continuing to do so. It might be easier to play the blame game, but the facts are the facts -- the state of California makes a lot more money off a gallon of gas than oil companies do.

These facts aren't refuted by regulators (in fact, they're the ones who publish them), or even politicians.

But deflecting blame won't lower costs, won't bring down inflation, won't make it easier for working families to thrive in California. We need realistic policy solutions, not scapegoats, and trying to deflect blame won't lead to meaningful solutions anytime soon.",dailybreeze.com,news,Daily Breeze,,-0.05098039215686279,448985027,1,https://www.dailybreeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OCR-Z-INFLATION-1213.jpg?w=640,

Under the agreement -- announced Thursday -- Resonac America will pay a $416,003 penalty and destroy 1,693 pounds of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) for illegally importing the planet-warming chemicals on four occasions in 2023 and 2024.

He noted that the case marks the largest penalty imposed to date as part of EPA's National Enforcement and Compliance Initiative on Mitigating Climate Change -- and the first to require the company to destroy the HFCs.

Resonac America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Resonac, did not immediately return a message left at the chemical manufacturer's San Jose office.

The settlement comes weeks after a San Diego man became the first person prosecuted under a 2020 law that aims to slow climate change by prohibiting importation of HFCs without EPA permission. An indictment accuses the man of smuggling greenhouse gases into the United States from Mexico and selling them.

""HFCs are a powerful climate pollutant, so it's imperative that companies importing them into our nation do so in strict accordance with environmental laws,"" EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Martha Guzman said of the latest case.

Guzman said the case is the latest in a series of EPA HFC enforcement efforts nationwide, ""which send a clear message that the federal government is vigilantly monitoring imports of HFCs and will hold illegal actors accountable.""

HFCs -- chemicals made up of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon -- are considered potent greenhouse gases and are used in refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insulation, fire extinguishing systems and aerosols. The global warming potential of an HFC can be hundreds to thousands of times stronger than carbon dioxide.

EPA says that on three separate occasions -- in October, November and December 2023 -- Resonac imported 6,208 pounds of illegal HFCs. The imports violated a prohibition on importing bulk regulated substances into the U.S. without possessing the required allowance, EPA said.

Resonac also failed to give EPA a required notice of planned shipments of HFCs for the 2023 shipments as well as for a February 2024 shipment. EPA said the company also failed to timely submit reports to the EPA with information on HFCs that the company imported in the first and second quarters of 2023.

The enforcement prevents approximately 6,208 pounds, or 2.816 metric tons, of illegal HFCs from being imported into the United States, EPA said. If released into the atmosphere, the HFCs are the equivalent of about 41,677 metric tons of CO2, the amount of emissions associated with powering 8,225 homes with electricity for a year.

Under the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment, developed countries have agreed to phase down the production and import of HFCs by 85 percent from historical levels by 2036.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan has warned that climate protections could be hindered by an HFC black market that has emerged as federal regulators have sought to cut the pollutants' use. EPA says it has made enforcement of HFC laws a priority, working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deny entry to approximately 81 shipments of illegal HFCs since January 2022.",scientificamerican.com,news,Scientific American,,-0.1450980392156863,448984995,1,https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/11d4021ad19b7dc3/original/GettyImages-1134353358.jpg?w=1200,

A recent Los Angeles Times editorial completely misrepresented the root causes and attempted to cast blame in the wrong place. This is the same tactic the governor and Legislature have been using to try to displace the blame, but the facts speak for themselves. For example, it is a FACT that many factors impact California's gas prices, but policy choices made by the governor, Legislature, and state regulators have made California's gas and diesel prices the highest in the nation.

As of March 11, 2024, state and local governments collected $1.24/gallon in taxes and fees -- 27 percent of the total cost of a gallon of gas goes to state and local agencies and another 18 cents above this goes to federal taxes. These aren't industry talking points; these are FACTS provided by the California Energy Commission tracked and monitored over the past 20-plus years. The California government collects a 58-cent state excise tax, 12 cent per gallon low carbon fuel standard cost, 54 cents for cap and trade and other environmental fees, 10 cents for state and local sales tax, and a 2-cent state underground storage fee.

How do the governor and editorial writers at the Times justify this? Especially because gasoline taxes are one of the most regressive taxes in the state and are directly responsible for our high cost of living and high inflation rate. To offset this fact, the governor and Legislature argue that the money goes to pay for environmental programs.

While that may have been the Legislature and regulators' original intent, these environmental fees are unrestricted profits to the state and can be used for whatever purpose the governor and Legislature wish, regardless of their connection to the environment. This year, the governor plans to take the profit he's made off of all California drivers' gasoline and diesel purchases to backfill the state's general fund budget.

According to a recent report for the Center for Jobs and the Economy California's aggressive climate laws and regulations have done no better and, in some years, worse than the rest of the nation, but they are increasing the price of electricity, fuels and natural gas. Other states have produced actual emissions reductions by pursuing alternative and generally less costly approaches.

Meanwhile, regulators and the governor are doubling down on their expensive policies that are driving up the cost of living. According to the Energy Commission, currently, our unique gas adds 15 cents to every gallon sold in California. In just a few months, CARB expects that cost could increase by another 47 cents per gallon. Eventually, this program could increase by a total of $1.83/gallon -- and both are CARB estimates in constant 2021 dollars that do not account for inflation-on top of the other environmental fees and taxes that are already the highest in the nation.

At a time when Californians are paying more for electricity, housing, food, and other necessities they cannot afford a 50-cent increase per gallon, let alone nearly two dollars more.

The bottom line is that California's policy choices are driving the high cost at the pump, and they're continuing to do so. It might be easier to play the blame game, but the facts are the facts -- the state of California makes a lot more money off a gallon of gas than oil companies do.

Published as part of the ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2024.

Large movements in oil and gas prices, coupled with higher price volatility amid the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, have raised the question of to what extent speculation is driving oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices have increased significantly since the pandemic came to an end, with large-scale price volatility seen during the post-pandemic recovery. More recently, renewed concerns of heightened price volatility have been triggered by the terrorist attacks in Israel and the rising tensions in the Red Sea, albeit to a lesser extent than in the post-pandemic recovery period, putting some upward pressure on Brent oil prices (Chart A, panel a). Yet, at the current juncture, upside pressure on oil prices from geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ cuts is being offset by weak demand and higher non-OPEC production. Although gas prices have also reacted to recent geopolitical tensions, they have remained well below 2022 levels. Against this background, attention has again turned to trying to understand the drivers of oil and gas prices. Of particular interest is the question of whether prices mainly reflect fundamental factors (i.e. global supply and demand for oil and gas) or more non-fundamental factors related to speculative positioning. The topic has been heavily debated for more than two decades, with some observers pointing to speculation and the financialisation of commodity markets as the main drivers behind spikes in oil prices. Academic studies, however, do not generally find strong evidence of financial speculation playing an important role.

Market metrics generally point to speculation playing a limited role above and beyond hedging needs. The importance of speculation can be measured by constructing speculation indices for both oil and gas markets using the ""Working T index"". Using data on positions in the US futures market from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitments of Traders (COT) report, the index measures speculation as the amount of futures contracts held by non-commercial traders (as a proxy for speculators) in excess of what it is required to balance hedging positions held by commercial traders (which are measured by the reporting institution). Values above one indicate that traders hold more contracts than needed to hedge market risk. Speculation could amplify price movements (both raising or lowering prices) depending on the position taken by investors; the average impact of speculative activities in the sample is assessed in the second part of this box. Looking back in time, the index for oil was stable until around the end of 2002, with an average close to 1. The index then increased steadily until around 2010 - and once more in 2015 - to reach a peak of almost 1.3, but has subsided since then (Chart B, panel a). Overall, the correlation between the speculation index and the oil price appears to be limited.

Gas market speculation indices have remained broadly stable in both the United States and Europe over recent years. Given that gas markets are less globally integrated than oil markets, a further distinction is made between the US market and the European market. This is based on CFTC data for the United States and information from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) for dynamics in Europe. The analysis suggests that speculation in excess of hedging is historically higher in Europe than in the United States (Chart B, panel b). From a European perspective, the gas speculation index increased following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even though it remained relatively stable when gas prices spiked again in the summer of 2022. The correlation between the speculation index and the gas price appears to be limited overall, with the series decoupling over the last few months.

An empirical investigation of the link between oil prices and speculation shows that there is only limited evidence that speculation affects the transmission of fundamental demand or supply shocks to oil prices. The empirical investigation of the role of speculation on energy prices focuses on the oil market, because gas prices are more heavily influenced by regional factors. The basic idea is to use a structural model to identify surprises in oil price movements (i.e. shocks to the oil price) that are not expected by market participants. This can help in assessing whether speculative positioning by investors significantly influences the dynamics of oil prices when shocks occur. For example, faced with a fundamental shock that causes an unexpected increase in oil prices, investors excessively exposed to oil prices might re-adjust their portfolio, amplifying the effect of the shock. At the same time, investors holding positions that would lead to gains in the event of an unexpected increase in the oil price may close their positions to capitalise those gains, thus dampening the effect of the fundamental shock. This hypothesis can be tested by regressing oil price changes on fundamental shocks, conditioning on the level of investor positioning in oil markets (Chart C, panel a). Empirical estimates show limited differences in the reaction of the oil price when the level of speculation is higher. For crude oil spot prices, the elasticity to a standardised oil supply shock increases from 1.6 when the level of speculative contracts is low, to about 1.8 when investor net long positions are large. These estimates are not statistically different from each other, as confidence intervals overlap greatly. Differences are even smaller when considering oil futures as, in this case, risk-averse investors holding long positions will make a profit as they have correctly anticipated higher oil prices. Unwinding such positions will dampen the effect of the fundamental shock on oil prices. Overall, speculation is found not to play a major role in amplifying the transmission of fundamental shocks to oil spot and futures prices, in line with the academic findings mentioned above.

Speculation is also found not to amplify the transmission of fundamental shocks in periods of heightened geopolitical risk. Geopolitical tensions may influence oil prices through two different, opposing channels. First, greater geopolitical uncertainty acts as a negative global demand shock by raising doubts about the economic outlook with knock-on effects on consumption, investment and international trade. Via this channel, geopolitical uncertainty ultimately dampens global oil demand and oil prices. Second, geopolitical tensions may pose risks to future oil supply, increasing the cash value of holding oil contracts - also known as the convenience yield - thereby putting upward pressure on prices. These two channels push oil prices in opposite directions, and which one prevails is an empirical question. To test whether speculation may become more important as an amplifier of oil price movements in the face of geopolitical tensions, the analysis above is repeated, but focusing on periods of heightened geopolitical tensions (identified as periods when the geopolitical risk index created by Caldara and Iacoviello is above the historical average). The outcome indicates that the elasticity to oil supply shocks remains broadly stable, as confidence intervals between periods of low and high speculation overlap completely (Chart C, panel b). These results suggest that speculation - as measured by the level of net investor positioning in oil markets - also has limited effect in amplifying price reactions to fundamental shocks in periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,-0.1764705882352942,448984513,26,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?0ef1632c35edede913681bb76af694a4,

The explosions damaged one of the refinery's units. This was reported by Russian propaganda Telegram channels.

The explosions in Novokuibyshevsk, Samara region, occurred on the night of March 23. Russians complained that this was the 12th attack on oil refineries in Russia in the last three weeks.

Later, the Russian Federation complained that the attack had disabled the AVT-4 unit at the Kuibyshev refinery. Therefore, the production cycle of the plant has been stopped.

The main activity of the Kuibyshev refinery is oil refining. The company was part of the Rosneft group. Kuibyshev refinery's product range includes more than 20 types of petroleum products. The main ones are gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied gas and sulfur.

As a reminder, on the night of March 23, the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery caught fire in the Samara region of Russia. Local residents said that they heard the sounds of drones before the fire - two explosions were heard.

Earlier it was reported that in the Samara region of Russia, a group of saboteurs tried to blow up a railroad bridge over the Chapayevka River. The same sabotage and reconnaissance group organized drone attacks on oil refineries in the region.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, there would be no more jet fuel, gasoline or diesel. Internal combustion engine automobiles, buses, trucks, lorries and coaches would be stranded. Airplanes powered by jet fuel would be grounded. Freight and passenger rail powered by diesel would halt. People could not get to work; children could not get to school. The shipping industry, transporting both freight and passengers, would be devastated.

There would be no point calling emergency services. The majority of ambulances, fire engines, police cars, rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles would be stationary. Most phones and computers would also vanish as their plastic components derive from oil, so it would be a struggle to find a way of communicating with the emergency services anyway.

The construction sector would halt, as diesel powered vehicles would be stranded: excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, cranes, cement mixers, rollers and compact loaders would remain stationary. New homes or buildings could not be built or receive vital maintenance work.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, petroleum based-products would vanish with it. This would impact the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Aside from the supply chains disruption, the structure of lithium-ion batteries would be affected. A lithium-ion battery has four parts: an anode, cathode, electrolyte and a separator. Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene petroleum-based products. The petroleum-derived synthetic rubber used on car and bicycle tyres would cease to exist.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, food production would be devastated. Many of the vehicles necessary in agriculture ̶ tractors, mowers, combine harvesters, balers, sprayers and seeders ̶ would stop working. Food packaging necessary for storage and preservation would not be available. Petroleum coke, a by-product in oil refining, is used as a feedstock in manufacturing synthetic fertilizers, which are important in increasing crop yields. Food shortages and the knock on impacts would likely ensue.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, it would be catastrophic for health services everywhere. Staff would lack mobility, and essential supplies would be stranded. Beyond transportation, petroleum is an essential feedstock for pharmaceuticals, plastics and medical supplies.

Latex gloves, medical tubes, medical syringes, adhesives, some bandages, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, cleaning agents, prosthetics, artificial heart valves, resuscitation masks, stethoscopes, MRI scanners, insulin pens, infusion bags, medication packaging, face-masks, and Personal Protection Equipment are largely derived from petroleum-based materials. The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

It is difficult to conceive of a modern hospital without this range of essential petroleum-based products.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, the renewables industry would be impacted. The fibreglass, resin or plastic necessary for the construction of most wind turbines, would disappear. The ethylene used in the production of solar panels would vanish. Most of the mining vehicles ̶ large trucks, rotary drill rigs and rock drills ̶ necessary to extract the critical minerals upon which the production of solar photovoltaic plants, wind farms and EVs depend, would become stationary.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, homes would be transformed beyond recognition. There is the possibility roofs would collapse, for example, if bitumen was a key product. Other materials used in insulating homes would disappear. If you relied on heating oil to keep warm, that would go. The linoleum flooring and tiling would be impacted. Painting the walls would be a challenge. Furniture, pillows, rugs, curtains, dishes, cups and non-stick pans all are likely to be made from petroleum-derived products too.

It would be a challenge to stay clean or keep homes clean, if oil disappeared tomorrow. Laundry detergent and dish detergents usually derive from petroleum-based products. Soap, toothpaste, hand-lotion, deodorant, shampoo, shaving cream, eyeglasses, contact lenses, combs, brushes; all normally contain petroleum-derived products.

It would be a struggle to get anywhere, as the asphalt that paves roads and footpaths would vanish.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, millions of jobs would be lost. Tax revenues would be depleted. Industrial production would crimp. Economic growth would go into reverse. The plight of the fuel poor would be worsened.

This is not even the full list of everything that would be impacted, in such an unthinkable scenario.

Yet, despite these realities, there are calls saying 'Just stop oil,' 'Keep it in the ground,' or 'don't invest in new oil and gas projects.'

Of course, everybody wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced. OPEC believes that technological solutions and efficiency improvements can play a vital role. The oil industry is already proactive in this regard.

We need to be cautious of endangering the present, in the name of saving the future. It is important we all fully understand the immense benefits that oil, and the petroleum products derived from it, continue to provide to people and nations across the world.",qarannews.com,news,qarannews.com,,-0.2470588235294118,448983789,1,,

Check out our latest analysis for Natural Gas Services Group

While Natural Gas Services Group made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.

Over the last three years Natural Gas Services Group has grown its revenue at 15% annually. That's pretty nice growth. Broadly speaking, this solid progress may well be reflected by the healthy share price gain of 27% per year over three years. It's hard to value pre-profit businesses, but it seems like the market has become a lot more optimistic about this one! It would be worth thinking about when profits will flow, since that milestone will attract more attention.

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that Natural Gas Services Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 89% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 1.4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

""It's tough to find a singular trend, necessarily,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said, with Sunday the second game of a four-game homestand that opened with Friday night's 111-88 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans ""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're all aware of it. We can't go back and change the games that we've lost here.""

At 17-16 at home entering Sunday, the Heat already stand with more home losses in any season since they went 19-22 at home in 2018-19, when the building was known as AmericanAirlines Arena. That also was the last time the Heat went to the lottery.

Now, amid the home struggles, the lottery remains a reality again.

While Saturday's loss by the Brooklyn Nets to the New York Knicks assured the Heat of no less than a berth in the play-in tournament, elimination in that round would knock the Heat out before the best-of-seven opening round of the playoffs and therefore deliver them again to the lottery (and, yes, they retain their own selection this June).

Unless the home cooking becomes more palatable, the chances of enduring success would appear minimal.

Last season, when the Heat went from the play-in round to the NBA Finals, they closed the regular season with a 27-14 home record, a record now beyond their reach this season.

""Home or away, we've got a job to do,"" forward Jimmy Butler said, with Sunday one of eight remaining home games this season (also against the Warriors, Trail Blazers, Knicks, 76ers, Mavericks and a closing pair against the Raptors). ""I don't think anybody's scared to come in here and play us. I don't think anybody's scared to play us on the road, either.

""Hopefully in coming games we figure it out, we put our heads down and get to work. Because we definitely got to start winning if we want to get where we want to be.""

Lately, the Heat have had nearly as much talent in street clothes on their bench, amid the constant parade of injury absences.

That, center Bam Adebayo said, can't stand as an excuse.

""I feel like when we go out there and play with the right energy, it doesn't matter who's in or out,"" he said. ""We've shown that all season we can win with whatever lineup. We just need to hone in on the little things, the detail-oriented things.""

For Spoelstra, that is particularly essential at home.

""Certainly,"" he said, ""we would love to perform and show out better in front of our fans.""

With Duncan Robinson dealing with a back issue, Cole Swider has entered the Heat picture more than any other time during this first season under a Heat two-way contract.

As a matter of perspective, the 6-foot-8 forward had five 3-pointers all season before converting four in Robinson's absence on Friday night.

""It's not an easy role,"" Spoelstra said, ""to come in there, to see, 'All right, there's been a bunch of missed shots. I have to come in there, I have to clean up, make the longest shot in this game.' That's not an easy deal. But he's really worked at things, his player development.""

Swider, the 3-point specialist who went undrafted out of Syracuse in 2022, has split his season between the Heat and the G League Sioux Falls Skyforce.

""And all the games in Sioux Falls have kept him in the same system,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's really played extremely well there. So he's earned these kind of opportunities, probably maybe even some more throughout the course of the season.""

Amid his team's uneven run, Spoelstra said he has taken the time to teach his two young sons the nuances of the NCAA Tournament.

""I spent the night trying to teach my sons what March Madness is all about,"" he said, noting his connection to Gonzaga coach Mark Few, a fellow assistant coach with USA Basketball. ""I always try to watch Mark Few and Gonzaga whenever I can.

""That whole one-and-done format, you have no idea what to expect, and probably more so now than ever.""",sun-sentinel.com,news,SunSentinel,Ira Winderman,-0.09019607843137256,448983413,1,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tfl-l-heat-hawks-ud-jan-19-25.jpg?w=640,eng-9420783

The sultanate's total oil exports increased to 52.430mn barrels during the January-February period of this year against 49.713mn barrels in the same period of 2023, according to the data released by the National Center for Statistics and Information (NCSI).

Oman's total oil production decreased 4.3% to 60.073mn barrels during the first two months of 2024 from 62.750mn barrels recorded in the same period of last year. Crude oil production dropped 6.8% to 46.025mn barrels this year from 49.391mn barrels in 2023, while condensate production rose 5.2% to 14.047mn barrels, the NCSI data showed.

The sultanate's daily average output was 5.9% lower at 1mn barrels per day (bpd) in the first two months of 2024 against 1.063mn bpd in the same period a year ago. The average daily production in February stood at 994,400 bpd, falling below 1mn mark after more than a year.

Earlier this month, Oman and other OPEC+ member nations agreed to extend their voluntary cuts to oil production through the second quarter of 2024. The move is part of the OPEC+ group's strategy to stabilise the oil market and prices by reducing supply.

Oman extended its additional voluntary cut of 42,000 bpd of crude oil until the end of June 2024, in coordination with some OPEC+ participating countries, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had announced. This voluntary cut is in addition to the voluntary cut of 40,000 bpd previously announced by Oman in April 2023, which extends until the end of December 2024.

The decline in Oman's total oil production could have been much more significant if the sultanate had not substantially increased its condensate output, which is exempted from the obligations of the OPEC+ agreement.

Oman substantially increased its condensate output during the past three years, reaching a new annual record in 2023. Total condensates production during 2023 jumped by 8.3% to 85.47mn barrels compared to 78.96mn barrels recorded in 2022, according to NCSI data.

Oman sold its crude at an average price of $80.2 per barrel during the January-February period of this year, a decrease of two per cent from the $81.8 per barrel average price achieved in the corresponding period of 2023.

Oil exports to China, the biggest buyer of Oman crude, rose by 15.6% to 51.429mn barrels in the first two months of 2024. However, Oman did not export oil to India during the same period.

While crude exports to Japan fell more than 21% to just 1mn barrels during the first two months of 2024 from 1.267mn barrels a year ago, exports to South Korea remained zero during this period.",muscatdaily.com,news,Muscat Daily,,-0.05098039215686279,448983163,1,https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2OPEC-members-extend-oil.png,eng-9412709

The report comes as a new bill has been introduced seeking to create extreme weather guidelines for California schools, in hopes of preventing other families from suffering similar losses.

On that August day, Janee Robinson got a call from Canyon Lake Middle School in Lake Elsinore at about 11 a.m. and was told her son had collapsed.

Yahushua had been sprinting with other students during PE class, according to a description of video footage written by Deputy Coroner Myranda Montez and included in a report requested from the Riverside County Sheriff Coroner's Bureau.

""Shortly after, Yahushua was seen bending over and grabbing at his chest,"" Montez wrote.

He fell and got back up multiple times, she wrote, helped by other students and then by an adult, presumably his teacher. When ""it appeared Yahushua became unresponsive,"" the teacher carried him into the shade off-camera, the report states.

Paramedics arrived within minutes, but they -- and later hospital staff -- were unable to save Yahushua, who went into cardiac arrest en route to the emergency room, according to the report. He was pronounced dead at 12:25 p.m.

The official cause of death was a ""coronary artery anomaly.""

""Significant conditions contributing to death,"" but not related to the cause, included ""presumptive environmental heat exposure and recent physical exertion,"" the report states.

On Tuesday, March 19, Yahushua's parents, Eric and Janee Robinson, and family advocate Christina Laster were asked in an interview if they feel the school, which is part of the Lake Elsinore Unified School District, is at fault.

""We do believe this was preventable,"" Laster said.

She referred to the heat advisories that the National Weather Service had announced that day.

The district has stated previously that its staff acted promptly and that emergency services arrived within minutes.

District spokesperson Melissa Valdez did not answer a question about whether the district has policies related to weather conditions and outdoor activities in August, nor between Wednesday, March 20, and Friday morning, March 22. Valdez said Thursday there wasn't sufficient time to gather answers.

In the absence of state guidelines, some school districts have set their own. Western Riverside County districts with such policies include the Riverside and Temecula Valley unified school districts.

A May 2023 policy brief from UCLA's Luskin Center for Innovation says the state's K-12 education system ""is under-prepared for rising temperatures,"" and that schools are not required to adopt guidelines that ""actively prevent heat-related illness or guide how schools respond to heat."" It recommends, among other things, that statewide guidelines be created.

Senate Bill 1248, or ""Yahushua's Law,"" aims to do that.

It would require the California Department of Education to set guidelines for student activity during extreme weather conditions by July 1, 2026.

Those conditions include, but aren't limited to, ""periods of extreme heat, wildfires, excessive precipitation, and floods,"" the bill says, and activities would include ""physical education classes, outdoor sports, athletic practices, and recreational activities.""

State Sen. Melissa Hurtado, D-Bakersfield, co-authored the bill with Assemblymember Akilah Weber, D-La Mesa.

Hurtado said Wednesday, March 20, that Laster approached them with the idea for the bill.

""You don't really see a lot of constituent-led pieces of legislation,"" she said.

Hurtado said she has previously addressed climate change issues, and likes to focus on its ""human issues.""

If there's a way to prevent climate-related deaths at school, she said, ""then we need to have plans in place and be proactive.""

Yahushua's parents support the bill.

""We want to prevent this from happening to other families,"" said Janee Robinson, who's a PE teacher for another campus in the Lake Elsinore district and is currently on leave, using sick time donated by co-workers.

Similar incidents have occurred in recent years.

In 2010, a dozen teenagers suffered from heat exhaustion after a cross country meet in Los Angeles carried on in 97-degree heat. In 2021, a former Cal State San Bernardino student was awarded $39.5 million in a lawsuit settlement after she suffered heatstroke during a run for her kinesiology class and experienced severe brain damage, cardiac arrest and other health problems. The run took place in 95-degree heat.

The coroner's report doesn't say if, or when, Yahushua's heart defect could have caused problems had it not been extremely hot or if he hadn't been running. It states only that all three were factors in his death.

Eric Robinson said his son had no previous heart issues. Yahushua had been to the doctor for a physical exam three weeks earlier, the coroner's report states.

""At 6 years old, he played contact football with pads, everything,"" he said, ""and if you know football, sometimes it can be extreme. He never had an issue. Never.""

Janee Robinson said Yahushua was ""the healthiest one of our little tribe -- and we're very adamant when it comes to our children's health.""

Generally speaking, for those with that kind of heart defect, ""exercise and physical exertion can cause symptoms like chest pain and/or pressure as a result of narrowing or tightening of the artery, leading to symptoms and a compromise of blood flow to the heart muscle,"" Dr. Paymon Mesgarzadeh, chief of cardiology at Kaiser Permanente San Bernardino County, wrote in a Thursday, March 21, email.

Mesgarzadeh's comments did not refer to Yahushua's case.

For those born with coronary artery abnormalities, ""unfortunately, the first clinical symptom may be sudden death, particularly in young athletes,"" the doctor said, and many malignant coronary anomalies aren't discovered until an autopsy.

However, individuals with such anomalies may experience symptoms such as chest pain, pressure or passing out, often induced by exercise.

People with unexplained chest pain, pressure and/or feelings of faintness or dizziness should be evaluated, Mesgarzadeh said.

""While these symptoms may not always occur in congenital conditions, they should not be dismissed if they occur, particularly with exercise and sports.""

In the days after Yahushua's death, rumors spread online, including one that Yahushua was running alone, as punishment, for not wearing proper gym clothes.

The district denied that allegation in a September statement that Valdez provided Thursday.

""Students were dressed in PE attire and at no time were students penalized by running for not being dressed out for PE,"" it said.

""All students in class participated in a warmup run that lasted approximately less than one minute and no one was denied water.""

When asked about the rumor Tuesday, Laster said the information may have originated from other students' accounts of the incident.

She and Janee Robinson said there's a need to rely on the facts: the heat advisory, the physical exertion during PE class and Yahushua's death.

Meanwhile, the family is left trying to make sense of the situation.

Janee Robinson said she's grateful to the community for rallying around the family. A GoFundMe account created by Yahushua's aunt has so far raised $91,911. She also urged parents to continue advocating for their kids.

""It doesn't matter if no one's behind you,"" Janee Robinson said.

""Now, at this junction, my ask would be some accountability and some justice, because they can't bring him back,"" he said.

The family is considering legal action against the school district, Laster said.

""Yahushua walked to a different beat,"" reads part of a statement from his older sister, Amiya Banks. ""He was always singing and dancing, even when he was hurting or sad.""

His favorite song was alternative-R&B ballad ""Bad Habit"" by Steve Lacy, she said.

The heat and physical exertion also contributed to the Aug. 29 death of 12-year-old Yahushua Robinson, the report states.

The report comes as a new bill has been introduced seeking to create extreme weather guidelines for California schools, in hopes of preventing other families from suffering similar losses.

On that August day, Janee Robinson got a call from Canyon Lake Middle School in Lake Elsinore at about 11 a.m. and was told her son had collapsed.

Yahushua had been sprinting with other students during PE class, according to a description of video footage written by Deputy Coroner Myranda Montez and included in a report requested from the Riverside County Sheriff Coroner's Bureau.

""Shortly after, Yahushua was seen bending over and grabbing at his chest,"" Montez wrote.

He fell and got back up multiple times, she wrote, helped by other students and then by an adult, presumably his teacher. When ""it appeared Yahushua became unresponsive,"" the teacher carried him into the shade off-camera, the report states.

Paramedics arrived within minutes, but they -- and later hospital staff -- were unable to save Yahushua, who went into cardiac arrest en route to the emergency room, according to the report. He was pronounced dead at 12:25 p.m.

The official cause of death was a ""coronary artery anomaly.""

""Significant conditions contributing to death,"" but not related to the cause, included ""presumptive environmental heat exposure and recent physical exertion,"" the report states.

From electrifying scorers to tenacious leaders, these players have not only defined eras but have also brought moments of triumph and glory to South Beach.

In this article, we embark on a journey through time, revisiting the standout scorers who have donned the Heat uniform from the 1988-89 season to the 2022-23 season. From legendary figures like Alonzo Mourning and Dwyane Wade to modern-day stars such as Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, each season tells a unique story of perseverance, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence.

1988-89 Season: Kevin Edwards - 13.8 PPG

In the debut season of the Miami Heat in 1988-89, Kevin Edwards emerged as a vital scoring presence, averaging 13.8 points per game. As one of the foundational players for the newly established franchise, Edwards showcased his offensive versatility and determination on the court. Despite the challenges of being an expansion team, Edwards's contributions played a significant role in shaping the identity of the Heat in their inaugural NBA campaign.

The 1988-89 season was a formative period for the Miami Heat, and Kevin Edwards stood out as a key figure in the team's early development. His scoring ability provided a glimmer of hope for Heat fans amidst the trials of building a competitive roster from scratch.

1989-90 Season: Rony Seikaly - 16.6 PPG

The 1989-90 NBA season marked a significant milestone for the Miami Heat as Rony Seikaly emerged as a cornerstone player for the franchise. With an impressive average of 16.6 points per game, Seikaly's scoring prowess and dominant presence in the paint propelled him to new heights on the court. His exceptional improvement throughout the season was recognized with the prestigious Most Improved Player (MIP) award, a testament to his dedication and hard work.

Seikaly's impact extended beyond just putting up points, as he became a focal point of the Heat's offense and a defensive anchor in the paint. His ability to control the boards and protect the rim provided invaluable contributions to the team's success.

1990-91 Season: Sherman Douglas - 18.5 PPG

In the 1990-91 NBA season, Sherman Douglas emerged as a multifaceted threat for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 18.5 points and 8.5 assists per game. Douglas' dynamic playmaking ability and scoring prowess provided a much-needed spark for the Heat's offense as they continued to develop as a franchise. Despite the challenges faced by a young team in a competitive league, Douglas' contributions on the court were instrumental in keeping the Heat competitive throughout the season.

As the primary ball-handler and floor general for the Heat, Douglas not only showcased his scoring ability but also demonstrated exceptional court vision and playmaking skills. His ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates elevated the overall performance of the team's offense.

1991-92 Season: Glen Rice - 22.3 PPG

During the 1991-92 NBA season, Glen Rice emerged as the primary scoring threat for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 22.3 points per game. Rice's scoring prowess and offensive versatility were instrumental in keeping the Heat competitive throughout the season. His ability to stretch the floor with his outside shooting and attack the basket made him a dynamic offensive weapon for Miami.

While the 1991-92 season may not have resulted in playoff contention for the Heat, Glen Rice's individual excellence was undeniable. His scoring output and overall contributions solidified his place as one of the premier players in the league and laid the groundwork for his future accomplishments with the Miami Heat and beyond.

1992-93 Season: Glen Rice - 19.0 PPG

As the Miami Heat entered the 1992-93 NBA season, Glen Rice once again led the charge as the team's top scorer. Despite facing challenges and adversity throughout the season, Rice remained a steady offensive presence for the Heat, averaging 19.0 points per game and showcasing his scoring prowess night in and night out. His ability to create scoring opportunities and deliver clutch performances solidified his status as a key figure in the Heat's offensive arsenal.

While the Heat's journey in the 1992-93 season may have been fraught with ups and downs, Glen Rice's individual contributions remained a bright spot for the franchise. His dedication, skill, and leadership on the court set the tone for the team and inspired confidence in his teammates. Rice's unwavering commitment to excellence served as a guiding force for the Heat as they navigated through the challenges of the season.

1993-94 Season: Glen Rice - 21.1 PPG

Continuing his scoring dominance, Glen Rice once again led the Miami Heat in scoring during the 1993-94 NBA season. With his smooth shooting stroke and offensive versatility, Rice remained a constant threat on the court, averaging 21.1 points per game and showcasing his ability to light up the scoreboard in a variety of ways. His consistent production and leadership served as pillars for the Heat as they navigated through the ups and downs of the season.

Miami got their first ticket to the postseason that year, rounding up the season with a 42-40 record. Despite that, the Heat lost in the Eastern Conference First Round against the Hawks.

While the Heat's postseason aspirations may have fallen short once again, Glen Rice's contributions did not go unnoticed. His stellar play earned him accolades and admiration from fans and peers alike, solidifying his place as a beloved figure in Miami Heat history.

1994-95 Season: Glen Rice - 22.3 PPG

Glen Rice maintained his scoring prowess for the Miami Heat during the 1994-95 NBA season. With an average of 22.3 points per game, Rice continued to be the focal point of the Heat's offensive attack, showcasing his ability to score from all areas of the court. Despite facing adversity throughout the season, Rice's consistent production and leadership helped keep the Heat competitive in a challenging Eastern Conference.

Although the Heat came into the season fresh off a postseason berth, the team could not replicate the same success that season and had to go back to the drawing board and keep rebuilding.

1995-96 Season: Alonzo Mourning - 23.2 PPG

In the 1995-96 NBA season, Alonzo Mourning emerged as the primary scorer for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 23.2 points per game.

68.8% of Russian oil exported to the EU through Black Sea ports in December-February were delivered to the raid transshipment in the Gulf of Laconia near the coast of Greece. This transshipment is located within the exclusive maritime economic zone of Greece, where only the Greek authorities have the authority. The other 31.2% were delivered directly to EU ports even though sanctions prohibit it.

Russian tankers delivered crude oil the most frequently to Italian ports, going there directly from the Russian Black Sea ports. The volume of such Italian (mainly Sicilian) violations was 14.4% of all Russian Black Sea exports to the EU, involving ports of MILAZZO, AUGUSTA, TRIESTE, TARANTO, and SANTA PANAGIA. The Spanish ports of CARTAGENA and BILBAO also received Russian oil, as well as the Dutch port of ROTTERDAM, Croatian OMISALJ, Polish GDANSK, and Slovenian KOPER.

A total of 94 tankers brought Russian oil to these EU ports during the mentioned period. 52 of them belong to Greek companies, 11 - to Turkish companies, 4 - to Russian, registered in Dubai, 4 - to Russian, registered in India, while the rest belong to companies from Moldova, Cyprus, China, Denmark, Malta, UK, Latvia, Indonesia, Malaysia.

Data regarding total Russian exports of crude oil and petroleum products through Black Sea ports demonstrates that these exports remain stable despite Western sanctions, reaching 4.2 million tons of crude oil exports and 3,9 million tons of petroleum products exports through Black Sea ports in February 2024.

Black Sea remains the main Russian export route, given the EU's poor management over implementing its own sanctions.

At the same time, Indian refiners have recently decided to stop accepting crude cargoes on tankers owned by Russian state-run Sovcomflot. The shipping giant had carried about one-fifth of Russia's oil sales to India last year. Now its fleet of over 100 vessels is effectively shut out from that major market as refiners there refuse to take on the sanctions risk.

Amid weak sanctions and in an attempt to disrupt Russia's petroleum revenues, Ukraine has started its campaign of long-range strikes against Russian oil refineries. Since the beginning of the year, more than ten large refineries have been damaged. The number of major oil refineries in Russia is limited to 32, and Russia has already prohibited the export of petroleum to cover its internal needs.",euromaidanpress.com,news,Euromaidan Press,Bohdan Ben,-0.1215686274509804,448980944,1,https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/434050407_6997523907043429_7466911344428569604_n.jpg,ukr-235913

Our analysis of official UK Government data on oil and gas spills found that 1175 tonnes were spilled between January 2011 and December 2023. In total, there were 2252 spills.

A total of 308 tonnes of oil spilled into marine protected areas (MPAs) over the 13-year period. Marine life is at risk from routine spills, green groups pointed out, and oil and gas production harms marine life through toxic chemicals, ­microplastics and ­extreme noise pollution through ­seismic blasting.

Exposure to toxic oil fumes has been recognised to kill whales and dolphins even years later, according to the Centre for Biological Diversity.

Nearly all the spilled oil - 97% - came from oil rigs, while the ­remaining amount was spilled from mobile rigs, pipelines and vessels.

The Ferret's investigation is part of a special series called Scotland's Seas in Danger, and it follows the UK ­Government's controversial plans to authorise hundreds of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea.

Environmental campaigners said The Ferret's findings showed the scale of ""chronic oiling"" of the North Sea by the fossil-fuel industry. Greenpeace said drilling for oil can ""devastate marine ecosystems"" but despite this the UK Government is ""greenlighting a new North Sea drilling ­frenzy - including in marine ­protected areas - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the ­climate crisis"".

In reply, the UK Government said it has an extensive framework of ­environmental protection measures in place to deal with spills. A trade body for the oil and gas industry said companies have ""comprehensive oil spill response plans in place to ­mitigate against potential incidents occurring and minimise the impact should they occur"".

The Ferret analysed the data on unplanned hydrocarbon releases at North Sea oil and gas facilities, which were reported to the Offshore ­Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED).

Offshore oil and gas operators in UK waters must report all ­accidental releases of oil or chemicals to OPRED within six hours, regardless of the volume of the spill. They use the ­Petroleum Operations Notice 1 (PON1) reporting system.  The vast majority of incidents - 99% - were below two tonnes and ­averaged two kilograms. Spilled ­liquids include crude oil, diesel, ­condensate, hydraulic oil and lube oil. Most spills include oil and liquid gas.

But the small spills add up to 125 tonnes of spilled oil and liquid gas. Their causes include spills while filling bunkering vessels, overfilling vessels, holes and ruptures in pipelines, valve, seal and pump failures, equipment failure, and subsea releases.

There have been 25 incidents since 2011 where more than two tonnes were spilled, releasing 1051 tonnes of oil.

In 2012, 605 tonnes of natural-gas condensate was spilled at the Elgin field platform, operated by ­TotalEnergies.

The second-worst spill in Scottish seas was in 2020 when 238 tonnes of diesel was spilled into the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt MPA.

There have been 215 spills into MPAs since 2011, totalling 308 tonnes of oil. 116 spills were reported in the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt and 93 in East of Gannet and Montrose Fields which is a habitat for the ocean quahog, a clam native to the North Sea with a lifespan of up to 400 years.

In 2011, two spills released 580kg of liquid gas into waters just nine miles off the coast of Fraserburgh. The area was designated as the ­Southern Trench MPA in 2020 and is a breeding ground for the minke whale which is a protected species.

BP, Shell and TotalEnergies ­operated the wells and vessels that spilled the most and they ­collectively ­accounted for 82% of spills by ­quantity and 42% by number of spills.

The spills in the three most ""leaky"" fields - Elgin (operated by ­TotalEnergies), Foinaven (operated by BP) and Gannet F (operated by Shell) - were all in, or in close ­vicinity, of the MPAs. 79% of all spilled oil in the Scottish North Sea area came from one of these three fields.

Spills have decreased in mass as well as number, with an average of 200 spills per year between 2011 and 2019, compared to 112 spills per year since 2020.

In January, the UK Government gave 17 oil companies the right to drill for fossil fuels in 24 new ­licence areas across the North Sea. These ­followed an initial tranche of 27 ­licences ­offered in October last year. The ­licences were granted in the ­Central North Sea, Northern North Sea and West of Shetland areas.

Firms could begin producing oil and gas before the end of the decade, the North Sea Transition ­Authority said.

According to the Scottish Government's 2020 Marine Assessment, even small oil spills can have an ­environmental impact if they happen in conservation areas.

Philip Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, claimed that The Ferret's findings ""prove that many of the UK's marine reserves are paper parks protected in name only, where fossil fuel giants like Shell drill - and spill - to their hearts' content"".

He added: ""Drilling for oil at sea can devastate marine ecosystems, but the government is greenlighting a new North Sea drilling frenzy - including in marine protected areas - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the climate crisis while doing nothing to lower our energy bills or boost our energy security.""

Naomi Tilly, campaign lead at Oceana UK, said: ""While catastrophic oil spills grab headlines - as they should - the less well-known 'chronic oiling' of UK seas has an insidious impact, creating an almost constant hazard for ocean wildlife.

""Sea birds are especially vulnerable, for instance, as the oil strips them of the ability to stay warm, dry and afloat. Even if they escape ­hypothermia or drowning, oiled ­feathers make flight more tiring, which on a migration can be the ­difference between life and death.""

She added: ""Of course it isn't just sea birds, whales and dolphins that ingest the toxic oil as they come up for air - shellfish accumulate the ­contamination in their ­bodies, the list goes on. Yet our ­government ­continues to allow oil and gas ­developments to be sited within our marine 'protected' areas.

""This utter disregard for some of the UK's most inspiring wildlife is not what the British people want or deserve.""

Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell (below) said that the ""number, volume and location of these spills are extremely concerning"".

He added: ""We've all seen the damage even a single spill can do. To have so many, especially in close proximity to marine protection areas designed to protect vulnerable species and ­habitats, should ring alarm bells.

""While oil companies rake in ­billions, they seem to be taking safety for granted, putting our seas, their fragile ecosystems, and the communities that rely on them at risk.

""Government and regulators must ensure the proper precautions are in place and followed, and act swiftly where they aren't.""

Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner Caroline Rance said: ""With a spill recorded every couple of days on average for the past decade, it's clear this industry can't operate without causing serious harm.

""The repeated damage to marine protected areas is totally unacceptable and these offenders must be taken to task to explain these incidents and put in place plans to stop it ­happening again in future.

""Oil will spill and gas will leak so any new oil and gas production will inevitably lead to further pollution of this type, in addition to the climate devastation it will bring.""

Mark Wilson, health, safety and environment operations director at Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said the oil industry ""recognises that there is no room for complacency when it comes to unintentional releases to sea"".

He added: ""The industry takes all such releases seriously, regardless of size or potential for harm, and is ­focused on driving continuous ­improvement.

""The reporting of unintentional ­releases of oil is conducted in an open and transparent manner no matter how small the release. For context, the UK annually produces about 40 million to 45 million tonnes of oil and up to 40 billion cubic metres of gas. This equates to just under half the UK's demand for oil and gas.""

A spokesperson for the UK ­Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it ­monitors offshore pollution incidents ""closely"" and investigates all reports of accidental releases.

""If required, appropriate action will be taken, including the use of fines or referral for criminal prosecution,"" the spokesperson added.

""We have a comprehensive ­legal framework of environmental protection measures for offshore oil and gas activities, which covers all ­stages of the licensing and consenting ­process.""

The output in the southeastern Gabar mountain region is currently at around 37,000 barrels per day (bpd), Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said at an iftar, a fast-breaking dinner, in Istanbul.

""We will reach 40,000 barrels by the end of Ramadan. Our goal is 100,000 barrels by the end of the year,"" Bayraktar said.

The production gradually rose from 25,000 bpd in October to 30,000 bpd in December before reaching 35,000 this January.

""There is a billion barrels of oil here. We are producing rapidly,"" said Bayraktar, stressing that reaching the year-end target would double Türkiye's current production.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced the discovery of an oil reserve in Şırnak province's Mount Gabar in late December 2022. Erdoğan said the reserve contained an estimated 150 million barrels of oil valued at approximately $12 billion (TL 384.09 billion).

It was followed by the discovery of another reserve in the region last May, which the state oil company Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) said boasted about 1 billion barrels and a market value of up to $80 billion.

Türkiye has intensified its oil and gas exploration activities since 2020, with the Gabar region playing a significant role in pursuit of reducing the country's heavy dependency on imported energy resources.

The Şırnak province had long been a victim of PKK terrorist attacks and has suffered from underdevelopment for decades.

Years of counterterrorism operations have eventually enabled a major transformation of the region that is now home to one of the country's most important oil reserves.

The discoveries in Gabar increased the country's proven oil reserves to about 1.2 billion barrels. Türkiye is estimated to consume about 1 million barrels of oil a day.

In mid-2022, Türkiye also announced the discovery of $1 billion worth of oil reserves in the Çukurova field in southern Adana province.

Türkiye is almost entirely dependent on imports to cover its energy needs, which left it vulnerable to rising costs that surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Türkiye's crude oil production has risen gradually over recent years, reaching about 70,000 barrels per day in 2022. This compares to 65,000 barrels daily in 2021, 61,000 in 2020 and 57,000 in 2019.

The output averaged 80,000 barrels last year, a figure that the country expects to increase to 200,000 in 2024.

Separately, Türkiye has been developing the 710 billion cubic meters (bcm) natural gas field in the Black Sea, which was gradually discovered in August 2020.

In April 2023, it started pumping gas from the Sakarya field into the national grid through a pipeline linked to an onshore processing facility. Türkiye will meet approximately 30% of its annual gas need once the Black Sea reaches total capacity.

Bayraktar said the current production from the field has reached 3.7 million cubic meters per day.

""This is just the beginning. We need to increase this production. We need to discover new fields. In 2024, we may announce new discoveries with new exploration and new wells,"" he noted.

Emphasizing the importance of energy security, Bayraktar said the government's first goal is to continuously meet Türkiye's increasing energy demand, cheaply and with high quality.

""Our second goal is, unfortunately, Türkiye's biggest problem in energy, which is dependency on imports. Türkiye imports two-thirds of the energy it consumes. We import almost all of our natural gas, 92% of our oil and 40% of our coal,"" said the minister.

""When you import such a large amount of energy, you pay in foreign currency.""

Bayraktar also elaborated on the goals in nuclear energy, saying Türkiye needed to be in the ""Champions League of energy.""

""Since the 1950s, Türkiye has had nuclear goals. Under the leadership of our president, Türkiye has taken the most important steps in nuclear energy in the history of the republic,"" he noted.

Bayraktar said about 30,000 people are working at the site of Türkiye's first nuclear power plant in Mersin province on the southern Mediterranean coastline.

The Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), built by Russia's state atomic energy company Rosatom, will boast four reactors and will supply 10% of Türkiye's electricity consumption, said the minister.

""We want to commission the first reactor this year. Many direct and indirect steps are being taken to prevent the construction of this plant. We are continuing with determination,"" said Bayraktar.

The plant will ultimately have a total installed capacity of 4,800 megawatts. Estimated to cost around $20 billion, the NPP is expected to be fully operational by 2028. It is part of Türkiye's ambitious plan to triple its renewable energy capacity by 2053 as it strives to become a carbon-neutral economy.

The country's ultimate goal is to increase electricity production capacity from nuclear energy to 20 gigawatts, nearly four times what the Akkuyu plant could generate.

Türkiye has been holding talks with several countries, including Russia, about building a second power plant in the Black Sea city of Sinop.

Bayraktar has said Türkiye is in talks with China to build the country's third nuclear plant in Kırklareli province in the Thrace region. He said they hoped to finalize discussions and strike a deal on the plant's construction soon.

Among other efforts, Bayraktar underlined that Türkiye would soon become a country that produces energy using renewable, domestic resources and nuclear power.

""When we achieve these, Türkiye will truly make a revolution in energy and leap forward in energy, and these energy initiatives will directly impact the economy. We will be a Türkiye that has progressed much better in many areas.""",dailysabah.com,news,Daily Sabah,Daily Sabah,0.05882352941176472,448980558,1,https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/800x531/320907.jpg,

The appeal was made by Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Osun State while speaking with journalists on Sunday in Osogbo.

Oyintiloye also held that the cost of the cooking gas was becoming unbearable for the masses.

The APC chieftain said although the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Ekperikpe Ekpo, on February 22, announced that the federal government had asked LPG producers to stop exporting the commodity added that the decision had not yielded any positive results in the reduction in price of the item locally.

He suspected that the rising prices of the item might be as a result of LPG producers secretly exporting the products.

""It is alarming that the cost of refiling a 12.5kg of cylinder in many part of the country now ranges between N17,500 and N18,000.

""As a result of this exorbitant prices, many LPG users who could not afford the price were gradually shifting to solid fuel like charcoal and firewood.

""The shift to the use of charcoal and firewood by the masses could aggravate climate change challenges and its adverse effects such as deforestation, desertification and soil degradation that could lead to erosion.

""The use of solid fuel can also lead to air pollution with carbon monoxide emitted from solid fuel, which is harmful to human beings because it binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the ability of blood to carry oxygen to the body's organs.

""This will in turn pose serious danger to the respiratory organ, fatigue, headaches, confusion, and dizziness to human system due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain, thereby reduces overall well-being of people.

""Human being depend on green plants for our daily supply of oxygen, while giving back carbon dioxide to the plants.

""In an attempt to substitute clean cooking gas for firewoods and charcoal by cutting down green trees, this will affect human survival"", he said.

The Osun APC chieftain, however, urged the president to drastically crash the price of the product in the interest of the masses and to save the country's forest and ecosystem.

He insisted that while many Nigerians were struggling to look for what to eat, the means of cooking their food should not be made difficult for them again.

""I know Mr President has a listening ear and he will do something urgent about this matter.

""The announcement by the petroleum minister(state) on the ban on the exportation of the product is a good one, but it has not started having any positive effects on the masses.

""The fuel subsidy removal is biting hard on the people and electricity supply is not stable.

Bengaluru is India's IT capital and it is second Silicon City in the world after San Francisco, he said, adding that at present the capacity of Cauvery water supply to Bengaluru city is 18 TMC (Thousand Million Cubic Feet).

The population of Bengaluru as noted by the Supreme Court was 96 lakh in 2011 whereas its present population has touched a phenomenal 1.35 crore, Gowda noted.

He added that the projected population of Bengaluru metropolitan region for 2044 would be about three crore for which the water requirement by lifting from the Cauvery river would be about 72.40 TMC as assessed by Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB).

""Therefore, to meet the ever-growing demand for drinking water, it was decided to construct a balancing reservoir at Mekedatu site across river Cauvery near the border of Tamil Nadu,"" the JD(S) supremo said.

According to him, the pre-feasibility report of Mekedatu project was submitted to the Central Water Commission in April 2018 and CWC, after examination of the same, gave permission to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) in its letter dated November 22, 2018.

Accordingly, the DPR was prepared and submitted to CWC in January 2019 duly complying with its observations and norms.

The DPR has been sent by CWC to the Cauvery Water Management Authority for its consideration and approval, where it is pending for more than five years, Gowda pointed out.

The live storage capacity of the proposed reservoir will be 60 TMC only, the former prime minister said adding that Karnataka has already clarified that the project is not meant to be a storage reservoir but only a balancing reservoir contemplated for the supply of drinking water to Bengaluru City.

""There is no irrigation component under the project. In fact, Tamil Nadu will be benefitted substantially by this project as it will get regulated release of water instead of getting uncontrolled seasonal flood waters that may ultimately goes to the sea,"" Gowda noted.

The bulletin itself didn't mean much to the ordinary Nigerian on the street. But it meant a whole lot to a team of engineers from NNPC/ Shell on that day. One of them was Charles Osezua a 35-year-old natural gas engineer from the famous Texas A&M University in Houston and author of this fascinating book The Rise of Gas: From Gaslink to the Decade of Gas.

Months before in cloistered seclusion in far flung posh offices in London, The Hague and closer home in Lagos, the engineers beavered away formulating a Gas Policy and Pricing to leapfrog the industrialisation process in Nigeria. In the course of their study and data collection, the team toured the industrial zones of the 19 states in Nigeria - Aba, Kaduna, Kano, Jos, Offa, Onitsha, Port Harcourt, Warri to conduct a ""market survey to establish the potential gas market in Nigeria, determine the cost of infrastructure required to deliver, and establish the commercial prices for its realisation.""

Done with their assignment, they made persuasive presentations to stakeholders in the Oil & Gas industry, NNPC, Shell, NEPA, industrialists and relevant government ministries ""to ensure their buy-in."" And, of course, the Armed Forces Ruling Council the highest decision-making body in the country presided over by military President Ibrahim Babangida who was also Commander-in-Chief. The team's argument was straightforward: for the government to consider gas a better, cheaper source of energy for economic development and not focus only on crude oil at the expense of what scientists call the queen of the hydrocarbons.

AFRC gave their thumbs-up thus prompting the midday jubilation in May by the engineers. It was going to be a new dawn for the country and they were understandably over the moon.

""I was excited and felt very proud to be a Nigerian and I could envision, immediately, the economic development and transformation of my country facilitated by gas which would fuel power and petrochemical plants, as well as fertiliser companies with other multiplier effects,"" Osezua gleefully recalls following the approval. ""It was an opportunity for Nigeria to industrilise, stamp her authority as the leading economy in Africa, and perhaps dictate the pace of, or become the go-to-nation for Gas Policy and Pricing dynamics.""

Alas, the team's happiness was premature and short-lived. As the author tells it in his riveting account, the new law on gas had to be documented in a Federal Government Gazette. It never go to be. Why?

The Minister of Industry, Power and Steel at the time an Air Force chief who was absent from the AFRC meeting when the approval was given, arbitrarily overruled his superiors (including the C-in-C) insisting that his ministry ""cannot pay the approved tariff.""

To the author's utter dismay, the AFRC reviewed and reversed the policy bringing to an abrupt end a master plan for Gas Policy and Pricing painstakingly put together over a period of nearly three years. Responding to the reversal, Osezua says they were all shocked, asking rhetorically: ""Have we suspended our future as a nation that was set to dictate the pace for other emerging economies in Africa?""

Apparently, the government of the day did not think so, neither did successive administrations. It was not until President Muhammadu Buhari declared the turn of the 21st century as the Decade of Gas - part of the subheading in the title of the book - that Nigeria had a comprehensive gas policy in place.

As the title suggests, Osezua'a book chronicles the history of the bride of the hydrocarbons from its very beginning, his role in it and early enthusiasm shown towards a workable national gas policy, the consequences of not tapping into it early enough, the crude politics and power play involved, the betrayals and in-fighting among the big players in the sector. But most shocking to the author is the total disregard by successive Nigerian governments for the vast potentials of gas as an alternative energy source for economic development.

Refining crude with its attendant gas flaring has its environmental hazards. It is not so with gas. Gas is a more effective and cheaper means of running factories compared to diesel or petrol. In fact, Osezua makes a persuasive case that most of the moribund industries in Nigeria today, especially textile, may still be in operation if they had not been totally dependent on diesel and petrol.

""What has happened since President Babangida's junta suspended the national gas policy?"" The expert on gas provides an answer. Think of the frequent collapse of the national grid, he urges readers. ""What about the regular scarcity and shortage of cooking gas? Or the textile mills that have all ceased to exist in Kaduna, Kano and Katsina and fertiliser scams that have bedeviled the country? Spare a thought for all the factories that have shut down over the past few years because diesel has surged past N700 per litre. These were all problems that the gas policy which had positioned gas as alternative to fuels and feeds was hoping to avoid.""

Part of Osezua's solution was to set up Gaslink Nigeria Limited, a pioneering company to ""show the world that I could walk the talk."" Along with some like-minds, Osezua made a bid for a franchise on gas distribution by Nigeria Gas Company in 1996. It was precisely what he and his team suggested on Gas Policy Pricing which the AFRC rejected. Joining the bid, according to the author, ""was to prove that it was possible to translate what we had on paper into reality"" and, ultimately, ""have industries in the industrial clusters switch their fuel sources from diesel or fuel to the cheaper, cleaner, more efficient alternative gas.""

But for willing and supportive financiers, Gaslink may never have existed. A major backer is Chief Ifeanyi Ochonogor who gave a loan of $3m, pointedly telling Osezuwa that ""we invest in character, not in presentations! Anybody can make a good presentation, but it is the character of the person that make things work."" Another is Tony Elumelu who also offered loan facilities to the young company.

Once Gaslink got under way, civilian governor of Lagos State Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ever receptive to progressive ideas, gave Osezua full backing following a presentation by the Gas Man to the governor. ""I am looking for people who will help me build a state the black man would be proud of, and what you have told me fits in right there,"" Asiwaju pointedly told Osezua. Of course, Gaslink got its ""Right of Way"" and ""No Objections"" from Governor Tinubu to laying pipes across roads and streets in the entire state. What's more, Osezua admits he never bribed anyone in the state for the approval by the governor. ""I did not give a dime to anyone in the Lagos State Government. I thank God that there were very good and decent people there.""

The Rise of Gas is not only about Nigeria's disinterestedness in tapping the vast deposits of gas down below. It is also the compelling story of how Osezua himself became a thoroughgoing professional on anything about gas in Nigeria leading to one of the oracles in the O&G industry Aret Adams nicknaming him ""Gas Man.""

Becoming Gas Man

Osezua's road to becoming Gas Man started way back as a 17-year-old in secondary school at Annunciation Catholic College Irrua. It was 1971. In Form 3, he was part of a debating team to Ughelli scheduled to also visit a Shell facility in the town. Touring the plant, an engineer pointed to an unquenchable tongue of flame and told the students: ""This is a gas flare,"" continuing that ""if properly harnessed, Nigeria can make a lot of money from this gas that is being flared.""

The teenage student was fascinated by what he saw from that moment on, he was hooked. ""They had taken us around the plant but it was the gas flare that finally caught my attention and the gentleman who was explaining that there was a lot of potential in the gas being flared. Using slides, he explained all that could be done with natural gas...the chemistry behind it and how hydrocarbons are the building blocks of the petrochemical industry.""

Post-secondary school, Osezua worked at Nigerian Broadcasting Station in Benin City where, as if predestined by fate, one thing led to the other resulting in him getting a government scholarship to study abroad. He opted to study Natural Gas Engineering at Texas A&M University - one of two institutions where the course is taught in the United States - instead of a school in the U.K. For Masters' degree he read Business Admin and International Law. Already aware of his entrepreneurial bias, Osezua chose to read the three courses ""to prepare me to view things better from both an Engineering and business perspective. The truth is, you could make an excellent design, but unless it makes economic sense, it will not be implemented.""

By the time Osezua returned to Nigeria for his mandatory one-year youth service, he was posted to the Gas Unit of NNPC, not a full Department, mark you. There was his boss Olukoga and his peer Ajade, Dr. Iheanyi Ohiaheri from Imperial College London, Saidu Mohammed a Chemical engineer.

There wasn't much to do in the Gas Unit of NNPC. Even so, Osezua never lost focus of its huge potential for economic development, writing articles and publishing them in O&G journals thus cementing his reputation as the man to chat up on anything gas. So, when NNPC/ Shell formed a team of engineers to come up with a policy statement on gas, Osezua was a natural choice. ""I believed that an awareness of the quantum of gas that we had, and a consideration of the commercial potentials would help bring not just awareness, but tilt the policy direction towards gas commercilisation,"" the author writes presciently.

For his commitment and knowledge of gas matters, Osezua would rise to become Technical Adviser to Aret Adams GMD of NNPC, a position he describes as ""a high profile one with responsibility for advising the GMD on all the business activities (internal and external, including operations, finance, commercial, and joint ventures) and managing the staff in the office of the GMD.""

In that position, Osezua witnessed some of the power play at NNPC, the forceful removal, in 1990, of Adams who rooted for meritocracy against the mediocrity canvassed for by Rilwan Lukman as Minister of Petroleum.

By the time Osezua left NNPC, another offer was waiting, an invitation to help start up Educational Cooperation Society (ECS) on recommendation from Reverend Robert Lozano vicar of Opus Dei in Nigeria, an organisation the author claims to have benefitted from. Now called upon to assist in setting up an educational institution, Osezua gladly took up the offer. At the time in 1994, Nigeria was in an economic tailspin, leaving hundreds of parents unable to fund their ward's education abroad. The idea, then, was to ""set up a business school in Nigeria that could cater to the training needs of that segment."" Thus was Lagos Business School at Victoria Island born and Osezua a pioneer once again.

Despite such digressions, The Rise of Gas is basically about gas and harnessing it in Nigeria. Since the discovery of crude not at Oloibiri in 1956 as the history books have it, but at Dahomey Basin and Akata near Eket, according to Osezua, Nigeria has focused more on exploration and marketing of crude oil instead of gas despite its availability. Associated gas, mostly flared (literally burning money, to the author) is what comes out while drilling for crude. Non-associated gas is what you get in quantum when you drill. To Osezua, both are useful but the ""industry and policy makers have not paid the kind of attention they ought to have paid gas. There is opacity and lack of direction and it all started from the definition of what gas means in the oil and gas ecosystem.""

Quoting Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, Director of Communications of NEITI, Osezua claims that Nigeria's major foreign exchange earner remains crude oil but argues that gas could easily displace it. For instance, in a 21-year period from 1999 - 2020, Nigeria earned over $741.8 billion from oil but statistics indicate that ""gas may well be our Eldorado."" It is not hard to see why.

In a presentation last year by Mrs. Monilola Udoh Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Nigeria has the ninth largest proven natural gas reserve in the world with approximately 200trilion cubic feet. Despite this, ""only 25 percent of those reserves are currently being developed.""

Assured a shelf life in libraries in O & G and engineering departments in schools and as a first of its kind in the history of publishing in Nigeria, The Rise of Gas is all the more important not just because a pioneer wrote it but because of its timeless value to students, researchers and policy makers. Like the untapped vast gas deposits in the Niger Delta, the book may just have remained in the womb of time without ever coming to life where it not for Gloria, Osezua's wife, who asked for the publication as a birthday gift. It is a birthday gift like no other.",thewillnews.com,news,"THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News",Michael Jimoh,0.2078431372549019,448980263,1,https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gas-pipelines.jpeg,

FORCE, HAGAN AND GLENN TAKE TOP SPOTS AT LUCAS OIL NHRA WINTERNATIONALS","POMONA, Calif. (March 22, 2024) - Brittany Force powered to the top spot to close out qualifying on Saturday at In-N-Out Burger Pomona Dragstrip, earning her first No. 1 qualifier of the 2024 NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series season at the 64th annual Lucas Oil NHRA Winternationals.

Matt Hagan (Funny Car) and Dallas Glenn (Pro Stock) also qualified No. 1 at the second of 20 races during the 2024 NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series.

After a lengthy rain delay, Force put together a run of 3.711-seconds at 335.73 mph in her 11,000-horsepower Mark Christopher Auto Center Chevrolet/Monster Energy dragster. It was the lone qualifying session due to weather and Force claimed her 47th career No. 1 qualifier with the standout run. She'll open eliminations looking for her first victory since 2022 when she finished the year as world champion.

""That was a good, consistent run and that's what we're focused on,"" Force said. ""We're in a good place and it's pretty awesome to have 47 No. 1 qualifiers. That's (crew chief) David Grubnic and this entire team. But our focus is on raceday and trying to get a win. We're ready for tomorrow.""

Eight-time Top Fuel world champion Tony Schumacher took second with a 3.735 at 331.85, while Billy Torrence took third with a 3.745 at 330.47. Tony Stewart's run of 3.737 at 328.30 during the second session was ruled invalid due to a timing system malfunction.

Reigning Funny Car world champion Matt Hagan, who won the Winternationals a year ago, made the most of his run on Saturday, going to No. 1 with a run of 3.893 at 330.15 in his 11,000-horsepower Johnson's Horsepowered Garage Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat for Tony Stewart Racing. It gives the four-time world champion 51 career No. 1 qualifiers and plenty of momentum going into raceday, where Hagan looks to pick up his milestone 50th career victory. He'll open eliminations against Buddy Hull trying to pick up his first win of the season.

""To do a burnout and still have that many fans in the stands after the weather was pretty cool,"" Hagan said. ""The track was tricky, so we'll take that run. All in all, I'm pretty happy with that. We've had a lot of success here and to make that run makes me feel confident going into tomorrow. We've won a lot of races because Dickie (Venables, crew chief) has been good on Sunday. It would be great to get that 50th (win) in Pomona. It's such a special place and it's really magical here. There's so much history and when you show up here, you get chill bumps. It's just a cool feeling.""

Ron Capps took the second spot with a 3.893 at 326.71 and Bobby Bode took third after going 3.972 at 292.96.

In Pro Stock, defending event winner Dallas Glenn racked up his fifth career No. 1 qualifier, closing out qualifying with a run of 6.536 at 209.75 in his RAD Torque Systems Chevrolet Camaro. Glenn made a big move to close out the day after the team made wholesale changes leading into the day. They struggled on Friday, but the changes paid off heading into raceday, putting the young standout in a good spot to try and earn his first win of the season. He'll open eliminations against KB Titan Racing teammate and rookie Sienna Wildgust.

""That was really satisfying,"" Glenn said. ""We basically rewired my entire car this morning. We changed so much stuff on it. We were not happy with it and it had been doing some crazy stuff. It at least worked for one run and we were pretty happy with it. The run felt amazing and we made a really killer run. Pomona has always been up there as one of my favorite tracks. I've always loved coming here and hopefully we have it turned around.""

Defending world champion Erica Enders qualified second with a 6.547 at 210.73 and Camrie Caruso jumped to third thanks with a 6.557 at 208.88.

Only one round of the Mission #2Fast2Tasty NHRA Challenge was completed on Saturday due to weather as well. Shawn Langdon and Steve Torrence both won the opening round in Top Fuel, while J.R. Todd and Austin Prock picked up the Funny Car victories. In Pro Stock, Glenn and Enders raced to Challenge wins.

(NYSE:SWX) Revenue Forecasts By 30%","Shareholders in Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SWX) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.

Following this upgrade, Southwest Gas Holdings' twin analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$5.5b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 60% to US$3.37. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.20 in 2024. The most recent forecasts are noticeably more optimistic, with a sizeable gain to revenue estimates and a lift to earnings per share as well.

Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Gas Holdings

Although the analysts have upgraded their earnings estimates, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$72.28, suggesting that the forecast performance does not have a long term impact on the company's valuation.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Southwest Gas Holdings' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 1.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 15% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 7.4% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Southwest Gas Holdings is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.

The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Pleasantly, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow slower than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at Southwest Gas Holdings.

Analysts are definitely bullish on Southwest Gas Holdings, but no company is perfect.

Russia launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack which also targeted the Ukraine's capital. This is Russia's third strike on Ukraine in last four days, targeting Kyiv for the second time.

""There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,"" Lviv's regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's energy ministry said equipment in the facilities caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear if they were talking about the same facility.

The energy ministry said Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on Sunday after attacks on the energy system.

Meanwhile, Poland also confirmed a breach of its airspace in early hours by Russian cruise missile targeting town in western Ukraine.

""On March 24 at 4:23 a.m. (0323 GMT), there was a violation of Polish airspace by one of the cruise missiles launched overnight by long-range aviation of the Russian Federation,"" the armed forces of Poland said in a post on X.

Poland's army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told that the missile travelled about 2 km (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.

Meanwhile Poland said that it would demand an explanation from Moscow. Foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement that, ""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems.""

Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia's presidential election.

Notably, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to deflect responsibility onto Kyiv for the tragic Moscow concert hall attack, which claimed the lives of 133 individuals.

""What happened yesterday in Moscow is obvious: Putin and the other scum are just trying to blame it on someone else,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy's remarks came in response to Putin's assertion that the suspects in the attack were fleeing towards Ukraine.

This downward trend was influenced by forecasts of milder weather, abundant gas storage, and low gas flows to LNG export plants, primarily due to service outages at Freeport LNG's Texas plant. Freeport LNG announced that two of its three liquefaction trains would be offline until May for testing and repairs. Consequently, front-month gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped to their lowest close since March 15.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that current gas stockpiles were about 41% above typical levels. This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market. In the coming week, prices are expected to remain under pressure, reflecting these mixed influences.

(Saturday, March 23, 2024) - Felix Rosenqvist and Alex Palou each battled gusty winds and changing track conditions Saturday to claim poles for the two heat races Sunday setting the field for The Thermal Club $1 Million Challenge.

Rosenqvist and reigning NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Palou will be at the head of the field for their respective 10-lap heat races Sunday on the 17-turn, 3.067-mile desert circuit near Palm Springs, California. The top six finishers in each of those heats will compete in the Sprint for the Purse, a two-segment, 20-lap feature race that awards $500,000 to the winner.

Live coverage of the two heat races and non-points Sprint for the Purse starts at 12:30 p.m. ET Sunday on NBC, Peacock and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

""It's an angry pack behind in the mirror,"" Rosenqvist of starting from the front in the heat. ""I think it's about the start and getting away, but, man, everyone's going to go for it. That's the beauty and the curse of this format. Everyone is just going to give it all, and that's what we did now and ended up first.""

Rosenqvist continued his strong performance from the season opener earlier this month in St. Petersburg by taking the top spot for the first 10-lap heat with a best lap of 1 minute, 38.5831 seconds in the No. 60 AutoNation/SiriusXM Honda despite problems with his push-to-pass mechanism during testing earlier today. The Swede qualified second and finished seventh in the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg presented by RP Funding in the first points-paying event of the season and his first with Meyer Shank Racing.

""We tried to stay calm after the morning; we had kind of a messy session,"" Rosenqvist said. ""I just tried to forget that session, take a deep breath and do it all again.

""It's so tricky out there, man. The wind is changing every lap. There's dust on the track. I was first out (in qualifying), so I was worried there was going to be poor grip. But I could focus on my tire warmup like we did yesterday, and I felt a bit more confident when I went for the lap. I guess all we had to do is put it together, and the speed is there. Awesome.""

Scott McLaughlin will join Rosenqvist on the front row for the first heat race after his best lap of 1:38.6068 in the No. 3 XPEL Team Penske Chevrolet. Rinus VeeKay will be on the inside of Row 2 in the first heat after his qualifying lap of 1:38.6283 in the No. 21 Ed Carpenter Racing Chevrolet.

Christian Lundgaard, quickest overall in two days of testing here Friday and today, qualified fourth for the first heat at 1:38.6394 in the No. 45 Hy-Vee Honda fielded by Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.

Each qualifying group - determined by a blind draw Thursday night at this private automotive club - had just eight minutes on track. The first group was clean other than a few drivers putting a Firestone Firehawk tire wide and kicking sand and dirt on the track. The second group faced more pressure when Marcus Ericsson spun off track and backed into the tire barrier in Turn 9 in the No. 28 Delaware Life Honda fielded by Andretti Global, spawning a red flag and freezing the clock with just one minute, 19 seconds left.

That forced the other 12 drivers in Group Two to decide whether they wanted to stand pat on their existing times or go for broke on one final trip around the circuit when the session resumed.

Two-time series champion Palou decided to take a chance in his No. 10 DHL Chip Ganassi Racing Honda as the wind picked up and swirled sand and dust around the circuit. Palou, who led both test sessions Friday, produced the top lap of qualifying with his Group 2-topping run of 1:38.5675 despite having only 14 seconds of push-to-pass left for that lap.

""Looking forward to tomorrow,"" Palou said. ""After all that confusion with the red flag and everything, we didn't know if we were going to be able to put a lap together. But happy with that.

""We were using everything (push-to-pass) on that lap before it went red, so happy with that pace. The car is good.""

Palou will start on the pole for the 20-lap Sprint for the Purse - divided into two-lap segments - if he wins his heat race because he produced the quickest lap of the two qualifying segments.

It will be an all-Chip Ganassi Racing front row for the second heat race as Marcus Armstrong qualified second at 1:38.7575 in the No. 11 Ridgeline Lubricants Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Graham Rahal, who struggled for pace here Friday and today in testing, found grip at just the right time to qualify third at 1:38.9723 in the No. 15 Fifth Third Bank Honda fielded by Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Rookie Linus Lundqvist completed a strong second qualifying group for CGR and will start fourth after his best lap of 1:39.0685 in the No. 8 American Legion Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.",speedwaymedia.com,news,Speedway Media,,0.1764705882352942,448979239,1,,eng-9421043

In a 28-page decision, the SC sitting en banc reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals (CA), which had found the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) liable to pay the Bulacan provincial government a share in the use of water from Angat Dam.

""All told, the Court finds that the CA erred in affirming the RTC Decision which found petitioner liable to pay respondent a share in the utilization and development of national wealth,"" according to the decision, written by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting.

The Supreme Court said water impounded in a dam ceases to a natural resource, and thus cannot be subject to the tax on national wealth.

""Being already appropriated, dam water is no longer subject to national wealth tax because appropriate tax is to be determined and imposed upon the extraction of water from a natural resource and accordingly, prior to the impounding and appropriation of water,"" according to the decision.

The Bulacan provincial government, through Governor Josefina M. Dela Cruz, had claimed that the MWSS profited from the water resources of Angat Dam, located in Bulacan.

They argued that MWSS is liable to pay the local government a share from its utilization and development of national wealth.

The tribunal decided otherwise, noting that the MWSS does not generate income or derive profit from the use and development of dam water. the MWSS was created for regulatory purposes, it added.

1990-91 Season: Sherman Douglas - 18.5 PPG

In the 1990-91 NBA season, Sherman Douglas emerged as a multifaceted threat for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 18.5 points and 8.5 assists per game. Douglas' dynamic playmaking ability and scoring prowess provided a much-needed spark for the Heat's offense as they continued to develop as a franchise. Despite the challenges faced by a young team in a competitive league, Douglas' contributions on the court were instrumental in keeping the Heat competitive throughout the season.

As the primary ball-handler and floor general for the Heat, Douglas not only showcased his scoring ability but also demonstrated exceptional court vision and playmaking skills. His ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates elevated the overall performance of the team's offense.

1991-92 Season: Glen Rice - 22.3 PPG

During the 1991-92 NBA season, Glen Rice emerged as the primary scoring threat for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 22.3 points per game.

His ability to stretch the floor with his outside shooting and attack the basket made him a dynamic offensive weapon for Miami.

His ability to create scoring opportunities and deliver clutch performances solidified his status as a key figure in the Heat's offensive arsenal.

While the Heat's postseason aspirations may have fallen short once again, Glen Rice's contributions did not go unnoticed. His stellar play earned him accolades and admiration from fans and peers alike, solidifying his place as a beloved figure in Miami Heat history.

In the 1995-96 NBA season, Alonzo Mourning emerged as the primary scorer for the Miami Heat, averaging an impressive 23.2 points per game. Mourning's dominant presence on both ends of the court was instrumental for the Heat as they competed in a highly competitive Eastern Conference. His ability to score in the low post and block shots made him a formidable weapon for Miami.

While a definitive answer won't come until draft day, our Chiefs mock draft after free agency examines what path Kansas City could take in the 2024 NFL Draft.

Before diving into our 7-round Chiefs mock draft, here's a quick rundown of everything you must know.

Spending the Chiefs' first-round pick on a wide receiver is about multiple things. For one, future Hall of Fame tight end Travis Kelce could very likely retire after the 2024 season. It would leave a massive void in Kansas City's offense, especially with Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown poised to become a free agent. In short, adding a playmaker is just as much about long-term success as vying for a three-peat.

Adonai Mitchell is perfect for the Chiefs' offense. With Rashee Rice working underneath, Mitchell (6-foot-2) would serve as the offensive weapon who can beat teams both deep downfield and can make plays after the catch working the intermediate areas of the field. He's also very good at positioning his body in tight coverage to make contest catches, especially near the sideline. There's enough upside and talent for Mitchell to become a No. 1 receiver and being partnered with Patrick Mahomes in Andy Reid's offense is the perfect place for Mitchell to reach his ceiling.

The L'Jarius Sneed trade means the Chiefs' secondary will almost certainly take a step back in 2024. To avoid significant regression defensively this fall, Kansas City must improve its pass rush. It's an even bigger area of need because Charles Omenihu, who suffered an ACL tear in the NFL playoffs, likely won't be close to 100 percent whenever he returns.

Western Michigan Broncos edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland was dominant last season, both as a run defender and pass rusher. He generated 37 pressures with a 17.3 percent PFF pass-rush win rate and he ranked 17th in the FBS among edge rushers for run-stop rate (11 percent). The 6-foot-3 edge defender is a very good athlete for his size and he offers the versatility to put his hand in the dirt or be a stand-up pass rusher. Either way, putting him opposite George Karlaftis with Chris Jones on the interior would take this Chiefs' pass rush to another level in 2024.

As our Chiefs mock draft demonstrates, picking so late in the draft means you miss out on premium talent at the most important positions. Unfortunately for Kansas City, that could force them into waiting to address offensive tackle until some point on Day 3. On the bright side, Patrick Paul is a great consolation prize for the Chiefs coaching staff.

Related: Best tight ends of all time

We'll start with the athleticism. Standing at 6-foot-7, Paul recorded an excellent 9.75 Relative Athletic Score during the pre-draft process. Combine those movement skills with his long arms and you immediately see great tools at left tackle for an offensive line coach to work with. He also made improvements with his technique and pass blocking from year to year, the kind of growth that bodes well for future development. While Paul wouldn't be an effective starter at left tackle in 2024, he would be the long-term guy to protect Mahomes' blindside for years to come.

Chris Jones will almost certainly be finishing his career in Kansas City, but he isn't enough for this defensive line. Heading into his age-30 season, Kansas City needs to find someone who can both help give Jones some chances to rest and find a player who can bolster the depth on the interior defensive line.

McKinnley Jackson, a 326-pound defensive tackle, offers the first-step explosiveness that usually translates to the next level. At 6-foot-1, he's also demonstrated that he can get the lower pad level to help him win in one-on-one situations in the interior. While Jackson won't become a high-end starter, he can be an effective rotational defensive lineman and should be especially disruptive against one-on-one blocks with offensive linemen focused on Jones and Karlaftis.",sportsnaut.com,news,Sportsnaut.com,Matt Johnson,0.1686274509803922,448978040,1,https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NFL-Denver-Broncos-at-Kansas-City-Chiefs-21632224.jpg,

In some, ribs seem to zigzag between umbilical tubercles and parallel ventrolateral clavi. In others, the ribs are flexuous and curve forward from the umbilical shoulder and lap onto either side of the venter.

Its shell is covered in the lovely lumps and bumps we associate with the genus. The function of these adornments was likely to give them greater strength to go deeper into the ocean to hunt for food.

They look to have been a source of hydrodynamic drag, likely preventing Euhoplites from swimming at speed. Studying them may give some insight into the lifestyle of this ancient marine predator.

Euhoplites had shells ranging in size up to a 5-6cm. We find them in Lower Cretaceous, middle to upper Albian age strata. Euhoplites has been found in Middle and Upper Albian beds in France where it is associated respectively with Hoplites, Anahoplites, Pleurohoplites, Puzosia, and Desmoceras; in the Middle Albian of Brazil with Anahoplites and Turrilites; and can be found in the Cenomanian of Texas, USA.

It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"I am the Senior Director, Electrification at Energy Innovation.

Anyone who has experienced a red air day knows the metallic taste of air pollution that leaves a sting in your nose and lungs. On red air days when pollution hits unhealthy levels people are advised to stay inside and avoid outdoor activities especially the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those who suffer from respiratory illnesses.

Now, guess what is the leading cause of toxic air in most places?

Internal combustion engines fueled by gas or diesel are spewing dirty pollution into our lungs and atmosphere. More than two thirds of Americans rely on personal automobiles for day-to-day travel. And transportation is now the United States' largest source of the greenhouse gas emissions accelerating climate change, with light-duty vehicles alone responsible for nearly 60% of that sector's climate pollution.

Tackling our pervasive air pollution problem requires cutting tailpipe pollution from the cars we drive. Fortunately, we have a proven tool to make vehicles cleaner so we can all breathe easier: tailpipe emissions standards.

Last week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pulled this tool out of the clean air toolbox. The EPA made history by adopting new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles limiting tailpipe pollution that poisons the air we breathe and accelerates climate change. These updated standards compel automakers to adopt the latest clean technologies to ensure new vehicles will be cleaner than ever before.

Everyone, everywhere should have the choice to make their next car a clean car. Americans who care about reducing pollution deserve the choice to drive electric.

Air pollution harms 36 percent of the U.S. population -- or nearly 120 million people. According to the American Lung Association, more than 1 in 3 Americans live in places with unhealthy levels of air pollution, which affects lung development in children and can cause emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases. People of color and lower-income individuals are disproportionately impacted by air pollution.

Anyone who likes breathing cleaner air should celebrate this moment. But corporations that profit from selling the vehicles that pollutes our air and the petroleum that burns a hole in our wallets view these standards as a threat. They say these standards threaten American freedoms and consumer choice.

But the truth is that these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by cleaning the air we breathe and giving consumers the choice to get off the expensive fossil fuel rollercoaster.

Consider the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers' launch of a ""major seven-figure issue campaign across seven critical states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio and Montana -- and the Beltway, all aimed at informing Americans about the Biden administration's efforts to ban new gas, diesel and flex fuel vehicles from the U.S. market.""

In other words, profit-driven corporate polluters responded to the EPA's updated tailpipe emissions standards by actively manipulating the American public into thinking the standards are unwarranted. Their public disinformation campaign wants people to think the rules are a ban on gas cars.

That is simply false. By law, the EPA does not and cannot ban technologies or modes of transportation. The EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and informed by science and peer-reviewed research.

The Clean Air Act, signed into law in 1970, authorizes and directs the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and welfare, to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions. The Clean Air Act also directs the EPA to regulate emissions from vehicles and engines, and to adapt the standard over time.

The earliest standards for light-duty vehicles required a 90 percent reduction in emissions from hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide -- which drove the development of new engine and emission control technologies, such as the catalytic converter, and a switch to unleaded fuel.

Before the Clean Air Act was signed, our cities choked on air pollution so thick that breathing New York City's air was as bad as smoking two packs of cigarettes per day, and Los Angeles suffered through unhealthy levels of air pollution more than 200 days a year.

50 years later, our air is far cleaner. But despite decades of progress in reducing harmful emissions, air pollution from motor vehicles continues to harm public health, welfare, and the environment. Gas-powered vehicles will always belch ozone, climate pollution, particulate matter, and other toxic chemicals into our air.

These same corporate polluters who are fighting the EPA's clean air action today have fought against clean air for decades, all for the same reason - profit.

The EPA's updated standards help level the playing field for more advanced technologies, like battery electric vehicles, to compete in the market. They signal to the auto industry that now is the time to capitalize on fast-falling EV battery costs to deliver more affordable clean vehicle options for all consumers.

Most importantly, the EPA's rules fix market failures that have allowed corporate fossil fuel profiteers to dump pollution and rising fuel costs on the American public, contaminating the air we breathe while compromising our health and the stability of the climate.

By setting responsible limits on tailpipe pollution the EPA's updated standards put the U.S. on a new trajectory for cleaner air, better health, and a stable climate. These rules also mean more affordable clean vehicle models on the road for decades to come, saving consumers money every year over the vehicles' lifetimes. Today, EV models are cheaper to fill than gas vehicles in every state, putting money back in people's wallets with every trip they take

The EPA's final rule adopts more stringent emissions standards for criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases for model years 2027-2032 for light-duty vehicles (passenger vehicles), as well as Class 2b and 3 medium-duty vehicles (classes are based on the gross vehicle weight rating; a Ford F-250 is a class 2b vehicle, whereas a Ford F-350 is a class 3 vehicles).

The EPA's updated standards combined with new clean vehicle incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act and new funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are poised to transform the way we get around. Tax incentives and new funding for vehicles, infrastructure, manufacturing, and the entire clean vehicle supply chain can propel the U.S. toward a transportation transformation.

As it has done for the past 50 years, the EPA is improving air quality. These updated standards reflect significant investments in clean vehicle technologies that the auto industry is already making, and they support growing consumer demand for clean air and a climate safe future.

In time, the updated standards could leave toxic red air days in the rearview mirror - something that will help us all breathe easier.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.0117647058823529,448976760,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,eng-9418288

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, KS (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.",local3news.com,news,Local3News.com,Associated Press,-0.05882352941176472,448976597,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/local3news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/2b/c2b25481-12e8-52f0-b6f6-3f7cca41be34/660000864d19f.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

Extinction Rebellion (XR) groups from Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, Wimborne and Purbeck were joined by East Dorset Friends of the Earth, Bournemouth and Poole Greenpeace, Cycling Rebellion and other environmentalists from across the south west.

The campaigners marched from Corfe Castle to Perenco's Wytch Farm oil field works on Saturday, March 23.

Daniel Glennon, 52, from XR BCP, said: ""We blocked the entrance to Perenco's oil field works and offices for an hour - this was pre-liaised with Dorset Police and advised to Perenco.""

While blocking the entrance to this facility, there were speeches and music, with protesters were encouraged to bring food to share and have a picnic.

Peter Ohm, 77, from XR Wimborne described the event as a ""peaceful, family-friendly protest and rally"".

Extinction Rebellion said the purpose behind the protest was to maintain the pressure it has placed on Prerenco since the oil spill, calling on it to stop extraction now, and to ""shine a light"" on the firm's operations in Poole Harbour.

Approximately 85 per cent 'production fluid' and 15 per cent crude oil was spilled from 200 barrels in the harbour from oil firm Perenco's Wytch Farm in Ower Bay on March 26, 2023.

According to a report published earlier this week, the spill believed to have cost businesses £570k.

The report, published on March 19, and written by the consultant Hatch, said in the overall Dorset economy the loss is ""considered minimal"".

Greg Lambe, from XR Bournemouth, said it should not be forgotten how important Poole Harbour is in terms of wildlife.

He added: ""The risk of another, possibly much larger oil spill is far too high, especially as this oil field is in its 'end of life' stage, where investment in old infrastructure will likely be lacking, and that, as such, extraction should stop now.""

Ralph Doe, from XR BCP, said: ""We are determined to keep the risk of another oil spill in Poole Harbour and Perenco's operations abroad, at the top of the local and international environmental agendas, and we will be taking further action in the coming months.""

The scorching heat in March, expected to rise from 37 to 39 degrees Celsius as per the latest forecast, can lead to heat strokes in humans. Animals, inhabitants of the forests, cool off in the dense foliage that prevents the harsh rays of the sun from penetrating through and thus keeps their body temperature at a tolerable level. However, in the zoos, where the heat is unbearable, the denizens of the jungles have a tough time. At the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park, the staff take care of the animals like their family members.

The animal handlers, who man the enclosures, develop a strong bond with the particular animal species they are assigned to look after. Instructions from the handlers are obediently followed by all animals. Speaking with Pune Times Mirror, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park director Dr Rajkumar Jadhav said, ""We have made special arrangements for the birds, animals, mammals, and reptiles numbering 57 species which total to 435, especially during summer when the temperatures soar and the heat becomes unbearable.""

Jadhav added, ""For the birds and animals we have made arrangements to beat the heat. The two elephants, Mira and Janki, are bathed twice a day to protect them from the burning sun and a pool has been created for them to laze in and keep cool. Pools and drinking water ponds have been provided in all the enclosures."" ""For the tigress, 3 tigers, one who's white, the leopards, and the lions, a sprinkler fogging system is installed on the cage ceiling with a mist spray, along with coolers and wall-mounted fans to cool the interiors for the big cats and for the birds as well. The striped big cats are released one at a time to prevent conflict,"" he said.

Jadhav elaborated, ""Fruits ensconced in a block of ice called 'Ice Cake', a frozen seasonal fruit delicacy is provided to the sloth bears to gorge on ice-cold fruits."" ""As part of healthcare management, veterinarians constantly supervise the animals; electrolyte supplements are supplied daily,"" the director explained. ""Improvement and up-gradation is continuing daily in every sector, including increasing the enclosures and introducing new animal species. We have prepared a new website as well,"" the director said. Visitors along with their families flock to the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park at Katraj, established in 1999 on a 51-acre plot, in droves daily to view 57 species including wild animals, birds, and reptiles housed in separate enclosures.

The online ticketing system was initiated and implemented on November 11, 2023. The zoo sees thousands of visitors each day, where the numbers swell to more than 20,000 on festivals and national holidays, converging with their families to catch a glimpse of the 57 myriad species of animals in spacious enclosures. Ticket sales are from 9 am to 5 pm; the park is open till 6 pm. The species include the big cats such as the Royal Bengal tiger, the rare white tiger, Asiatic lion, African cheetah, leopard, Himalayan black bear, bison, wolf, jackals, striped hyena, elephant, four-horned antelope, black buck, zebra, Hamadryas Baboon, Bonnet, and Rhesus Macaque, lemur, Indian giant squirrel and more.",punemirror.com,news,punemirror.com,Prince Chaudhuri,0.2627450980392156,448976339,1,https://static.punemirror.com/full/d16ce0ef-6c7d-426b-b824-1ae5c382a34d.webp,

Also read:US sanctions on Venezuela threaten to disrupt India's crude oil imports

Trade sources and refiners said that imports are continuing at a ""health pace"" during March, but at lower levels compared to last month. After the US lifted sanctions on Venezuela for six months -- beginning October 18, 2023 -- India has been procuring cargoes from December 2023, after a hiatus of over three years, emerging as the largest buyer of crude oil in January 2024 from the country with the world's largest proven oil reserves.

As per energy intelligence firm Kpler, the world's third largest importer secured more than 2,54,000 b/d in January and over 1,91,000 b/d in December 2023 from Venezuela. Until 2019, India was Venezuela's third largest purchaser, after the US and China, importing roughly 3,00,000 b/d on an average.

Securing cargoes

Viktor Katona, Kpler's Lead Crude Analyst told businessline that Indian refiners exploited the US sanctions waiver in less than a month after the lifting of sanctions. India's refining system is one of the most sophisticated in the world, so the likes of Reliance Industries (RIL) or Indian Oil Corporation (IoC) would actually want to buy heavier grades, even with higher levels of sulphur, because they can convert residue into diesel and gasoline, the high-value products, he explained.

Even though RIL took the lead in February, importing two very large crude carriers (VLCCs), IoC and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) also participated sharing one VLCC tanker worth of cargo. RIL bought its first cargo that was already loaded in early December 2023 (aboard M/T Gustavia S).

When asked about the scenario in March, Katona said, ""After Indian buyers received three cargoes in February, March should see the arrival of three new cargoes again (of this, two have already discharged to Jamnagar - Nissos Kea and Eurohope), whilst one Phoenix Vigor is en route and should start discharging March 31. So after a three-year high of 1,75,000 b/d in February, March should see a marginal decline to 1,55,000 b/d.""

Back in the day when Venezuelan grades were off market and only Chinese buyers were in, a cargo of Merey would be priced around $20 a barrel to Brent, however, by now, with Venezuelan crude trading freely, a cargo of Merey would be discounted only to $8 to Brent. So the sanctions waiver also lifted Venezuelan prices massively, he added.

Reimposing sanctions

However, the threat of reimposition of sanctions by the US, after April 18, due to no visible progress between Venezuela's President Nicholas Maduro and Unitary Platform, particularly on allowing all presidential candidates to compete in the election, has threatened to impact the trade. But, an official with a domestic refiner said that so far imports are continuing and even if sanctions are imposed, the impact on imports would 'not be substantial'.

Last month, ICRA Senior VP & Co-Group Head Corporate Ratings Prashant Vasisht said that Venezuela accounts for only about 4-5 per cent of India's overall imports, besides which the discount available is low on a landed basis. Accordingly, even if sanctions are reimposed by the US, Indian refiners can easily shift to West Asian alternatives.

Katona said that ""interestingly enough"" the market expectation was that India would wind down purchases of Venezuelan cargoes with the looming deadline by which the White House would need to decide if it extends the sanctions waiver for another six months or goes for a sanction snapback.

Both will arrive around April 24-25, so one week after the potential sanctions snapback date. This underscores the belief that Indian refiners have in the sanctions being extended,"" he opined.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Miami Heat injury report

Cleveland Cavaliers injury report for Mar. 24

The Cavaliers have listed five players on their injury report: SG Max Strus (knee), PF Dean Wade (knee), PF Evan Mobley (ankle), SG Donovan Mitchell (nasal fracture) and SG Ty Jerome (right ankle) are out.

What happened to Donovan Mitchell?

Donovan Mitchell has been absent from a substantial number of the Cavs' recent matchups because of a bone bruise on his left knee, causing him to miss nine of their last 11 games.

Although he recently made a comeback after undergoing a PRP injection to address the bruise, Mitchell has undergone surgery for a nasal fracture.

This latest development will prolong his time away from the court by an additional week until he undergoes re-evaluation.

Miami Heat injury report for Mar. 24

The Heat have listed six players on their injury report: SF Caleb Martin (ankle) and G Jaime Jaquez Jr. (knee/ankle) are questionable, while SF Duncan Robinson (back), PF Kevin Love (heel), SG Tyler Herro (foot) and SG Josh Richardson (right shoulder) are out.

What happened to Jaime Jaquez Jr and Tyler Herro?

Jaime Jaquez has been added to the team's injury report and listed as questionable for Sunday's clash against the Cavaliers due to concerns regarding both knee and ankle problems, according to a report from Ira Winderman.

Tyler Herro experienced a left knee hyperextension during the Feb. 23 game, a 106-95 victory against the Pelicans. He exited the game in the fourth quarter, initially sparking concerns about a serious injury, but the injury turned out to be less severe than initially feared.

Although Herro could have returned after recovering from his initial injury, he faced another setback in his rehabilitation.

This time, he injured his right foot, leading to a short hiatus.

The Association held the ""Hong Kong Weightlifting Invitation 2024"" at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium, and the event was broadcast live on its YouTube channel.

In her speech at the opening ceremony, chairman Josephine Ip Wing-yuk said athletes from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan jointly organized the weightlifting event.

She described Hong Kong, in Cantonese, as a ""relatively small country"" when talking about the development of weightlifting and powerlifting sports. She also categorized the city as ""small countries"" like Australia.

Distributors are in the middle of that change. While preparing for a switch to equipment that uses lower-GWP refrigerants, and figuring out their place in the decarbonization movement, distributors are also employing AI in their work -- or planning to do so -- adjusting to market shifts, and coping with a multitude of other forces shaping the industry.

Earlier this year, Distribution Trends reached out via email to executives at four distributors to gather their thoughts on some of these changes.

Participating in the 2024 Distributors Roundtable were David Kesterton, president of Mingledorff's, based in Peachtree Corners, Georgia; Terry Tarantine, vice president of sales at Young Supply Co. in Chesterfield Township, Michigan; Sid Harvey, president of Sid Harvey Industries Inc. of Garden City, New York; and Doug Young, CEO of Behler-Young Co., based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

How much is the transition to A2L refrigerants affecting your organization, in terms of the equipment you're planning to stock and also in terms of the availability of refrigerants (if you carry them)?

Kesterton: Honestly, the transition is just beginning. We've been reviewing the transition plan with our major supplier and communicating specific product family/model plans with our clients over the past few months. ...

We will continue to roll out and review the plans during the course of the year (Zoom/in-person) in addition to conducting technical service and installation training meetings on a continuous basis.

Tarantine: We are planning to sell R-410A for as long as possible. Contractors have shown a history of selling existing technologies for as long as possible. Additionally, there is a general fear of higher pricing and A2L hesitancy on the part of end users.

Harvey: We plan to stock the equipment that our customers request. We will have an overlap of HFC equipment and A2L equipment but do not foresee any issues. The A2L refrigerants are currently available. We have been selling A2Ls for refrigeration purposes for a few years now and are already stocking R-32 and R-454B.

Young: It is certainly an area of extreme focus for our team. The timing of eliminating the 410A products and the introduction of the 454B products is very strategic. If not done properly, there are many negative ramifications. In many ways, we are at the mercy of the manufacturer. If they have a good plan and we have a good plan, we all win with a seamless transition.

Thank goodness for the coalition of AHRI, HARDI, and others that have been able to work with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for the additional year of sell-through of 410A product. If that was not accomplished, there could have been very serious problems throughout the industry, from supply in manufacturing to lost inventory value in distribution.

How are you collaborating with contractor customers so that you and they are ready for the A2L transition?

Kesterton: Again, like I mentioned, there is a good deal of education regarding installation and service that will take place during the 2024 year. Although A2L is different, it's not our first rodeo, so to speak. I think the most difficult part of the transition compared to R-410 is the compressed timeline. We introduced R-410 (Puron) in 1998 with a transition date of 2010. This one is much more compressed.

Tarantine: We have already started training on the EPA and DOE (Department of Energy) regulatory landscape. Refrigeration will be more significantly impacted than HVAC, and we are running training sessions currently.

Harvey: Our sales team speaks to our customers often about the transition, and the feedback we get helps us prepare for the changes. We hold in-house training for our employees and for contractors on the transition, which will help smooth the process.

Young: Our equipment manufacturer developed online training for our dealer network to take at their leisure. On top of that, we are holding regional update meetings partnered with a vendor that sells tools impacted by the A2L change. And lastly, we will dedicate a breakout session to all things A2L in our annual dealer meeting.

Decarbonization and electrification are trends in the industry. Did you sell more heat pumps in 2023 than in other recent years?

Kesterton: Yes, and we have been trending towards more heat pumps for really the past decade-plus.

Tarantine: Yes. We have been very active with heat pumps, especially when it comes to multi-family and larger building renovations. We are still struggling to get our dealers to propose hybrid systems, but we believe we will be moving more going forward.

Harvey: Heat pumps have been a part of our business for many years now. We have seen an uptick in sales almost every year, and we believe this trend will continue as new legislation is passed.

Young: The northern market has never embraced the heat pump philosophy and continues to struggle moving it forward. Our increase is small and insignificant in the big picture. To put a number on it, less than a 50-unit increase for 2023.

Ductless applications are still strong but not necessarily as a primary source of comfort. These applications are ancillary to traditional forced-air products.

How about high-efficiency equipment, such as condensing furnaces? How have sales in 2023 compared to those in the recent past?

Kesterton: Condensing furnace sales have increased, but because of our location and minimal heating hours, 80% furnaces and high-efficiency heat pumps have been the systems of choice.

Tarantine: Our ratio of high-efficiency furnaces to 80% has been growing every year for over a decade.

Harvey: The geographic areas that offer the contractor and/or end-user incentives to install energy-efficient equipment are where we have seen the most growth in high-efficiency units. When the incentives are substantial it can really influence the buying habits in those states.

Young: Ironically, even with the decrease in 2023 unit sales, our high-efficiency furnaces remain at the same percentage of overall furnace sales as the prior year. That percentage has remained reasonably consistent year over year over year. We have seen no sharp increases or decreases.

There's been more discussion lately about applying artificial intelligence and automation to HVACR wholesaling. What is your view of how these kinds of technological advances can be used in distribution?

Kesterton: Well, I think there will be many applications in the future for AI. Advances in system diagnosis will be much more prevalent in the coming years. That is a huge benefit for the consumer, distributor, and contractor in the future. Today, while BOTs are rules-based decision-making, as opposed to AI (adapt and learn), we have been using them for years. Some common applications are expediting credit approvals, and inventory distribution center remixing BOTs.

Tarantine: We are just starting to see AI entering our industry but as will all businesses, it's coming and will dramatically alter how we manage information when it gets here and I believe it will be sooner rather than later.

Harvey: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing distribution in many organizations and will continue to do so. AI will be able to quickly recognize market trends, help to optimize inventory, and perform simple customer service tasks to provide even faster response times.

Young: We believe there are plenty of opportunities. We already use artificial intelligence in some of our firewall and cyber threat protections already. We are very close to selecting an emerging software provider to use this type of intelligence in optimizing our inventory and the management practices that go along with that (demand, balances, minimum/maximum, transfers, etc).

We also see opportunity in the pricing and sales and marketing areas. There is opportunity if you open your mind to what needs to get better. From an automation perspective, newer and emerging technologies and their reasonable cost entry points have allowed us to address our ""small parts"" through vertical lift machines at our distribution centers. We are also investigating autonomous mobile carts to streamline the travel through the distribution center.

There is also an opportunity in some of the back-office functions (accounts payable, accounts receivable, marketing promotions, product descriptions, and even code development) using some of the technological advances over the last few years.

So, the view is, you must continue to improve and get better to compete in the future, and many of these technological advances will be instrumental in doing that.

Overall, residential sales were down in 2023. Do you feel we are entering more of a repair-instead-of-replace market?

Kesterton: Hard to say right now. With so many new innovative systems being offered today, many consumers will still prefer to change out the entire system. If the retail salesperson offers the choices and explains the benefits (technology, benefits of new refrigerant, etc.) many consumers will decide to move forward with a new comfort system. On the standard end (minimum efficiency) of the spectrum, there may be some homeowners and commercial establishments who decide to repair rather than replace.

Tarantine: I have seen a slight trend towards repair versus replace, but I believe our exceptionally mild weather has been the primary culprit on lower AOR sales.

Harvey: It is hard to predict the future. We have seen the markets change over the last 93 years we have been in business. Our plan has always been, as a full-service wholesale distributor, to make sure we have all the right products to service the HVACR industry, whether it is for repair, add-on/replacement, or new construction.

Young: The repair-versus-replace transition took place last year for us. Unprecedented equipment price increases, overall inflation, and economic uncertainty have been huge contributors to this transition.

Are the supply chain issues that were so prevalent in the last few years behind us?

Kesterton: I would say most but not all. 2024 will be the year to hopefully put all of the past behind us for good!

Tarantine: There are still some crucial areas for shortage, 460V, and larger commercial units, but overall, the supply chain is approaching pre-COVID lead times.

Harvey: We have seen the supply chain getting better with most manufacturers. There are still some significant issues with rooftop units and other commercial products. Supply-chain reliability is a variable that will continue to change from time to time. Our job as a distributor is to be prepared for disruptions and act quickly to minimize the shortages and make sure we have the products our customers need. Lately, this has been more challenging, and the refrigerant and efficiency changes will affect the next several years. We look forward to partnering with our manufacturers and customers to ensure continuous improvement.

Young: For the most part the supply chain has normalized. The only significant exception we are still wrestling with is commercial equipment. Lead times have come down a bit, but they are a far cry from normal. This has been our most significant supply-chain pain point.",achrnews.com,news,The ACHR NEWS,,0.2078431372549019,448975257,26,https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2024/03-March/Distributors-Roundtable.jpg?height=418&t=1711050945&width=800,

Indian oil refiners - Moscow's second-biggest customers after China since the 2022 invasion - will no longer accept tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot because of the risk posed by sanctions.

Since the start of October, the US has ratcheted up sanctions on the wider fleet of tankers moving Russian crude oil. Dozens of those targeted have been languishing ever since, and more barrels of Russian diesel are floating idly on the oceans than at any time since 2017, according to analytics firm Kpler.

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's (G7) approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterised by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards US$90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a gruelling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

""It's a growing squeeze on Russian export flows, particularly to India,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects. ""We're at the stage where sanctions-related friction is becoming very evident.""

Since October, the US has designated 40 individual Russian oil tankers. Four of the more recently targeted ones are continuing to make deliveries, but no sanctioned ship has collected a cargo since being named by the US Treasury, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Now, an increasingly tough trading environment has delivered a powerful symbolic blow to the Kremlin as India - a stalwart commercial ally throughout war - shuns its fleet. At the same time, Ukraine has started blowing up Russian oil refineries, though it's not clear how much support for the strategy it enjoys in Washington.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and on exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. ""It comes at a time when the US is struggling to send more aid to Ukraine, when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline, and when Russia appears to be gaining the upper hand.""

State-run Sovcomflot transported about a fifth of all Russia's crude deliveries to India last year. The figure appeared to be in decline even before the news that nation's refineries would no longer accept the ships.

""We expect and welcome that global oil buyers will be much less willing to deal with Sovcomflot than in the past,"" a US Treasury spokesperson said, adding that the measures should have no oil market impact because Russia will maintain an incentive to sell oil.

Now that fleet will need to find work elsewhere - and there are signs it's struggling. At least seven of the vessels have come to a halt in the Black Sea and disappeared from digital monitoring systems, tanker tracking by Bloomberg shows. Sovcomflot admitted last week that sanctions had hurt its operations.

""The targeting of Sovcomflot represents a significant tightening of US sanctions against Russia,"" said Janis Kluge, senior associate for Eastern Europe and Eurasia at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ""It will not solve the problem of circumvention, but it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

Even so, Russia can still draw on a so-called ""shadow fleet"" of vessels amassed shortly after the 2022 invasion - often older ships without proper insurance and with unclear ownership - to make its deliveries. By some estimates, there are as many as 600 such carriers in operation, alongside Greek tankers that continue to serve the trade under the G7 price cap.

Delivery costs for Russian oil are huge. It costs about US$14.50 a barrel to delivery a Baltic Sea cargo to China, according to data from Argus Media. Well over half that sum is attributable to sanctions, it estimates.

""Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts,"" said Bronze at Energy Aspects.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to Mar 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Kluge.

That perhaps never was more evident than before the Miami Heat's game on Wednesday night at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

In the home-team interview room, Cleveland Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff was recalling a harrowing incident last season when a gambler got his phone number and began making threatening calls.

Down the hall, moments later in the visitor's interview room, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was relating a story of a gambler so intent on a desired outcome last season that the team had to have the spectator ejected.

Both conversations came in an arena that houses a Caesars-operated sportsbook.

For years, through partnerships and sponsorships, this has been the direction steered by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who in an op-ed piece a decade ago in the New York Times wrote, ""Sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight.""

The glare arguably never has been brighter, with the NBA this past week announcing that live betting would be coming to NBA League Pass -- watch while wagering.

That was among the reasons the topic was broached ahead of the Heat's victory over the Cavaliers.

It led to answers both unexpected and concerning.

""I do think it's somewhat contradictory,"" Spoelstra said of the NBA aggressively and emphatically moving into the gambling space. ""I think it treads on a weird line, for sure.""

China's largest fuel processor, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical, reported 58.3 billion yuan (S$11 billion) net income for last year in an exchange filing. That compared with 66.2 billion yuan in 2022.

Global oil prices were 17 per cent lower in 2023 than the previous year, which reduced the value of Sinopec's drilling output but also lowered its crude costs.

Chinese refiners ramped up fuel production last year to feed a populace eager to travel after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. Still, the company had to grapple with a tepid economic recovery that created a glut of some chemicals such as ethylene.

The increase in refining activity also boosted China's oil imports to a record.

Our analysis of official UK Government data on oil and gas spills found that 1175 tonnes were spilled between January 2011 and December 2023. In total, there were 2252 spills.

A total of 308 tonnes of oil spilled into marine protected areas (MPAs) over the 13-year period. Marine life is at risk from routine spills, green groups pointed out, and oil and gas production harms marine life through toxic chemicals, ­microplastics and ­extreme noise pollution through ­seismic blasting.

Exposure to toxic oil fumes has been recognised to kill whales and dolphins even years later, according to the Centre for Biological Diversity.

Nearly all the spilled oil - 97% - came from oil rigs, while the ­remaining amount was spilled from mobile rigs, pipelines and vessels.

The Ferret's investigation is part of a special series called Scotland's Seas in Danger, and it follows the UK ­Government's controversial plans to authorise hundreds of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea.

Environmental campaigners said The Ferret's findings showed the scale of ""chronic oiling"" of the North Sea by the fossil-fuel industry. Greenpeace said drilling for oil can ""devastate marine ecosystems"" but despite this the UK Government is ""greenlighting a new North Sea drilling ­frenzy - including in marine ­protected areas - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the ­climate crisis"".

In reply, the UK Government said it has an extensive framework of ­environmental protection measures in place to deal with spills. A trade body for the oil and gas industry said companies have ""comprehensive oil spill response plans in place to ­mitigate against potential incidents occurring and minimise the impact should they occur"".

The Ferret analysed the data on unplanned hydrocarbon releases at North Sea oil and gas facilities, which were reported to the Offshore ­Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED).

Offshore oil and gas operators in UK waters must report all ­accidental releases of oil or chemicals to OPRED within six hours, regardless of the volume of the spill. They use the ­Petroleum Operations Notice 1 (PON1) reporting system.  The vast majority of incidents - 99% - were below two tonnes and ­averaged two kilograms. Spilled ­liquids include crude oil, diesel, ­condensate, hydraulic oil and lube oil. Most spills include oil and liquid gas.

But the small spills add up to 125 tonnes of spilled oil and liquid gas. Their causes include spills while filling bunkering vessels, overfilling vessels, holes and ruptures in pipelines, valve, seal and pump failures, equipment failure, and subsea releases.

There have been 25 incidents since 2011 where more than two tonnes were spilled, releasing 1051 tonnes of oil.

In 2012, 605 tonnes of natural-gas condensate was spilled at the Elgin field platform, operated by ­TotalEnergies.

The second-worst spill in Scottish seas was in 2020 when 238 tonnes of diesel was spilled into the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt MPA.

There have been 215 spills into MPAs since 2011, totalling 308 tonnes of oil. 116 spills were reported in the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt and 93 in East of Gannet and Montrose Fields which is a habitat for the ocean quahog, a clam native to the North Sea with a lifespan of up to 400 years.

In 2011, two spills released 580kg of liquid gas into waters just nine miles off the coast of Fraserburgh. The area was designated as the ­Southern Trench MPA in 2020 and is a breeding ground for the minke whale which is a protected species.

BP, Shell and TotalEnergies ­operated the wells and vessels that spilled the most and they ­collectively ­accounted for 82% of spills by ­quantity and 42% by number of spills.

The spills in the three most ""leaky"" fields - Elgin (operated by ­TotalEnergies), Foinaven (operated by BP) and Gannet F (operated by Shell) - were all in, or in close ­vicinity, of the MPAs. 79% of all spilled oil in the Scottish North Sea area came from one of these three fields.

Spills have decreased in mass as well as number, with an average of 200 spills per year between 2011 and 2019, compared to 112 spills per year since 2020.

In January, the UK Government gave 17 oil companies the right to drill for fossil fuels in 24 new ­licence areas across the North Sea. These ­followed an initial tranche of 27 ­licences ­offered in October last year. The ­licences were granted in the ­Central North Sea, Northern North Sea and West of Shetland areas.

Firms could begin producing oil and gas before the end of the decade, the North Sea Transition ­Authority said.

According to the Scottish Government's 2020 Marine Assessment, even small oil spills can have an ­environmental impact if they happen in conservation areas.

Philip Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, claimed that The Ferret's findings ""prove that many of the UK's marine reserves are paper parks protected in name only, where fossil fuel giants like Shell drill - and spill - to their hearts' content"".

He added: ""Drilling for oil at sea can devastate marine ecosystems, but the government is greenlighting a new North Sea drilling frenzy - including in marine protected areas - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the climate crisis while doing nothing to lower our energy bills or boost our energy security.""

Naomi Tilly, campaign lead at Oceana UK, said: ""While catastrophic oil spills grab headlines - as they should - the less well-known 'chronic oiling' of UK seas has an insidious impact, creating an almost constant hazard for ocean wildlife.

""Sea birds are especially vulnerable, for instance, as the oil strips them of the ability to stay warm, dry and afloat. Even if they escape ­hypothermia or drowning, oiled ­feathers make flight more tiring, which on a migration can be the ­difference between life and death.""

She added: ""Of course it isn't just sea birds, whales and dolphins that ingest the toxic oil as they come up for air - shellfish accumulate the ­contamination in their ­bodies, the list goes on. Yet our ­government ­continues to allow oil and gas ­developments to be sited within our marine 'protected' areas.

""This utter disregard for some of the UK's most inspiring wildlife is not what the British people want or deserve.""

Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell (below) said that the ""number, volume and location of these spills are extremely concerning"".

He added: ""We've all seen the damage even a single spill can do. To have so many, especially in close proximity to marine protection areas designed to protect vulnerable species and ­habitats, should ring alarm bells.

""While oil companies rake in ­billions, they seem to be taking safety for granted, putting our seas, their fragile ecosystems, and the communities that rely on them at risk.

""Government and regulators must ensure the proper precautions are in place and followed, and act swiftly where they aren't.""

Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner Caroline Rance said: ""With a spill recorded every couple of days on average for the past decade, it's clear this industry can't operate without causing serious harm.

""The repeated damage to marine protected areas is totally unacceptable and these offenders must be taken to task to explain these incidents and put in place plans to stop it ­happening again in future.

""Oil will spill and gas will leak so any new oil and gas production will inevitably lead to further pollution of this type, in addition to the climate devastation it will bring.""

Mark Wilson, health, safety and environment operations director at Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said the oil industry ""recognises that there is no room for complacency when it comes to unintentional releases to sea"".

He added: ""The industry takes all such releases seriously, regardless of size or potential for harm, and is ­focused on driving continuous ­improvement.

""The reporting of unintentional ­releases of oil is conducted in an open and transparent manner no matter how small the release. For context, the UK annually produces about 40 million to 45 million tonnes of oil and up to 40 billion cubic metres of gas. This equates to just under half the UK's demand for oil and gas.""

A spokesperson for the UK ­Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it ­monitors offshore pollution incidents ""closely"" and investigates all reports of accidental releases.

""If required, appropriate action will be taken, including the use of fines or referral for criminal prosecution,"" the spokesperson added.

""We have a comprehensive ­legal framework of environmental protection measures for offshore oil and gas activities, which covers all ­stages of the licensing and consenting ­process.""

The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) is continuing its research projects on highly efficient gas turbines at the Werner-von-Siemens Centre for Industry and Science e.V. (WvSC) for another two years. The projects, which are funded by the state of Berlin and the European Union, aim to optimize the maintenance, repair, and development process of gas turbine blades and to develop sustainable additive manufacturing solutions.

Gas turbines play a crucial role in energy generation. Their efficiency and sustainability are of great importance because if less fuel is needed to generate the same amount of energy, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Current challenges, such as the wear of turbine blades due to corrosion and harsh operating conditions, require innovative solutions. The projects aim to use state-of-the-art additive manufacturing processes and digital solutions to increase productivity and performance in gas turbine construction, increase material reusability, and exploit previously untapped potential.

Human-machine interaction and AI

The MRO 2.0 project focuses on optimizing the repair process for gas turbine blades. The team is developing automated and digitalized refurbishment process chains that enable upgrades for highly efficient gas turbines. The goal is to automate and digitalize the repair process for turbine blades. While demonstrators and systems for assessing the condition of turbine blades as well as additive repair processes were developed in the first project phase, the focus of the second project phase is on transferring the findings to deployment. In addition to the technical issues, aspects of occupational psychology, such as the acceptance of new workflows and processes, will also be examined.

In the project, the BAM team is focussing primarily on new test methods for determining the residual wall thickness and assessing near-surface damage. They make it possible to precisely analyze the condition of the used turbine blades in order to then initiate suitable repair steps. Additive manufacturing technologies are used for the repairs, with BAM developing, evaluating, and qualifying suitable processes such as wire arc additive manufacturing, in which additional material is applied in a targeted manner, for example, to replace material removed during operation.

The scientists are also developing digital twins of the entire process. With the help of AI algorithms, they continuously analyze data on the operating conditions and the behavior of the turbine blades in use. This enables them to make predictions about the remaining service life of components, proactively plan maintenance measures, and minimize downtimes.

Ten partners are involved in the project, including Siemens Energy, several Fraunhofer Institutes, and the Technical University of Berlin.

Sustainable AM for high-temperature applications

The HTA 2.0 project is developing sustainable AM processes and components for high-temperature parts in large gas turbines. It builds on the successful results of the first funding period, in which the processing of high-temperature materials for complex components was characterized using powder bed-based laser beam melting, and effective process monitoring techniques were developed. This will enable component defects to be detected during the process in the future.

In the current project, the focus is on faster and more efficient processes. The AM processes are being evaluated in the context of sustainable product development to achieve more economically and ecologically efficient component solutions for the area of high operating temperatures in gas turbines. For example, various post-processing methods for additively manufactured components are being investigated and automated as far as possible to replace the manual and time-consuming processing steps that are still required today.

A central research focus is on increasing the reusability of the starting material for additive processes and reducing material waste. To this end, recycling strategies are being developed and tested for both used powder and consolidated solid material from waste originating from faulty construction processes and support structures. In this way, high material costs and environmental pollution are to be reduced. Holistic life cycle analyses evaluate the economic and ecological effects.

The project includes eleven partners from scientific institutions, large corporations, and several SMEs. BAM is contributing its expertise in comprehensive material characterization, the AM process, process monitoring, and component inspection, as well as the determination of material behavior at high temperatures.",voxelmatters.com,news,VoxelMatters - The heart of additive manufacturing,Edward Wakefield,0.3725490196078431,448973367,1,https://www.voxelmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-19-forschung-am-werner-von-siemens-centre-phase-zwei.jpeg,

Internal combustion engine automobiles, buses, trucks, lorries and coaches would be stranded. Airplanes powered by jet fuel would be grounded. Freight and passenger rail powered by diesel would halt. People could not get to work; children could not get to school. The shipping industry, transporting both freight and passengers, would be devastated.

There would be no point calling emergency services. The majority of ambulances, fire engines, police cars, rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles would be stationary. Most phones and computers would also vanish as their plastic components derive from oil, so it would be a struggle to find a way of communicating with the emergency services anyway.

The construction sector would halt, as diesel powered vehicles would be stranded: excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, cranes, cement mixers, rollers and compact loaders would remain stationary. New homes or buildings could not be built or receive vital maintenance work.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, petroleum based-products would vanish with it. This would impact the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Aside from the supply chains disruption, the structure of lithium-ion batteries would be affected. A lithium-ion battery has four parts: an anode, cathode, electrolyte and a separator. Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene petroleum-based products. The petroleum-derived synthetic rubber used on car and bicycle tyres would cease to exist.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, food production would be devastated. Many of the vehicles necessary in agriculture ̶ tractors, mowers, combine harvesters, balers, sprayers and seeders ̶ would stop working. Food packaging necessary for storage and preservation would not be available. Petroleum coke, a by-product in oil refining, is used as a feedstock in manufacturing synthetic fertilizers, which are important in increasing crop yields. Food shortages and the knock on impacts would likely ensue.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, it would be catastrophic for health services everywhere. Staff would lack mobility, and essential supplies would be stranded. Beyond transportation, petroleum is an essential feedstock for pharmaceuticals, plastics and medical supplies.

Latex gloves, medical tubes, medical syringes, adhesives, some bandages, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, cleaning agents, prosthetics, artificial heart valves, resuscitation masks, stethoscopes, MRI scanners, insulin pens, infusion bags, medication packaging, face-masks, and Personal Protection Equipment are largely derived from petroleum-based materials. The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

It is difficult to conceive of a modern hospital without this range of essential petroleum-based products.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, the renewables industry would be impacted. The fibreglass, resin or plastic necessary for the construction of most wind turbines, would disappear. The ethylene used in the production of solar panels would vanish. Most of the mining vehicles ̶ large trucks, rotary drill rigs and rock drills ̶ necessary to extract the critical minerals upon which the production of solar photovoltaic plants, wind farms and EVs depend, would become stationary.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, homes would be transformed beyond recognition. There is the possibility roofs would collapse, for example, if bitumen was a key product. Other materials used in insulating homes would disappear. If you relied on heating oil to keep warm, that would go. The linoleum flooring and tiling would be impacted. Painting the walls would be a challenge. Furniture, pillows, rugs, curtains, dishes, cups and non-stick pans all are likely to be made from petroleum-derived products too.

It would be a challenge to stay clean or keep homes clean, if oil disappeared tomorrow. Laundry detergent and dish detergents usually derive from petroleum-based products. Soap, toothpaste, hand-lotion, deodorant, shampoo, shaving cream, eyeglasses, contact lenses, combs, brushes; all normally contain petroleum-derived products.

It would be a struggle to get anywhere, as the asphalt that paves roads and footpaths would vanish.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, millions of jobs would be lost. Tax revenues would be depleted. Industrial production would crimp. Economic growth would go into reverse. The plight of the fuel poor would be worsened.

This is not even the full list of everything that would be impacted, in such an unthinkable scenario.

Yet, despite these realities, there are calls saying 'Just stop oil,' 'Keep it in the ground,' or 'don't invest in new oil and gas projects.'

Of course, everybody wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced. OPEC believes that technological solutions and efficiency improvements can play a vital role. The oil industry is already proactive in this regard.

We need to be cautious of endangering the present, in the name of saving the future. It is important we all fully understand the immense benefits that oil, and the petroleum products derived from it, continue to provide to people and nations across the world.

Tamil Nadu contends that the balancing reservoir will take away its share of Cauvery water and hence it has been opposing it.

In a press release, Gowda said the reservoir is necessary to provide drinking water to Bengaluru City and also regulated release of water to Tamil Nadu, including water release during lean periods.

Bengaluru is India's IT capital and it is second Silicon City in the world after San Francisco, he said, adding that at present the capacity of Cauvery water supply to Bengaluru city is 18 TMC (Thousand Million Cubic Feet).

The population of Bengaluru as noted by the Supreme Court was 96 lakh in 2011 whereas its present population has touched a phenomenal 1.35 crore, Gowda noted.

He added that the projected population of Bengaluru metropolitan region for 2044 would be about three crore for which the water requirement by lifting from the Cauvery river would be about 72.40 TMC as assessed by Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB).

""Therefore, to meet the ever-growing demand for drinking water, it was decided to construct a balancing reservoir at Mekedatu site across river Cauvery near the border of Tamil Nadu,"" the JD(S) supremo said.

According to him, the pre-feasibility report of Mekedatu project was submitted to the Central Water Commission in April 2018 and CWC, after examination of the same, gave permission to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) in its letter dated November 22, 2018.

Accordingly, the DPR was prepared and submitted to CWC in January 2019 duly complying with its observations and norms.

The DPR has been sent by CWC to the Cauvery Water Management Authority for its consideration and approval, where it is pending for more than five years, Gowda pointed out.

The live storage capacity of the proposed reservoir will be 60 TMC only, the former prime minister said adding that Karnataka has already clarified that the project is not meant to be a storage reservoir but only a balancing reservoir contemplated for the supply of drinking water to Bengaluru City.

""There is no irrigation component under the project. In fact, Tamil Nadu will be benefitted substantially by this project as it will get regulated release of water instead of getting uncontrolled seasonal flood waters that may ultimately goes to the sea,"" Gowda noted.

China's largest fuel processor, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., reported 58.3 billion yuan ($8 billion) net income for last year, it said in an exchange filing. That compared with 66.2 billion yuan in 2022.

Global oil prices were 17% lower in 2023 than the previous year, which reduced the value of Sinopec's drilling output but also lowered its crude costs.

Chinese refiners ramped up fuel production last year to feed a populace eager to travel after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. Still, the company had to grapple with a tepid economic recovery that created a glut of some chemicals like ethylene.

Interests: pipeline integrity management; steel & welding metallurgy; fracture mechanics; finite element analysis

At present, with the continuous development of the pipeline industry, pipeline transportation technology has developed by leaps and bounds, forming a relatively complete oil and gas storage and transportation technology system, and establishing a relatively complete modern pipeline industry system. With the rapid development of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary technologies have accelerated cross-integration, and oil and gas energy consumption, supply, technology, and institutional revolution have continued to deepen. The development of the pipeline industry and technology has entered a transition window period and a critical period of innovation. At the new historical starting point, in order to achieve high-quality and sustainable development of the pipeline industry, it is necessary to coordinate the coordination between safety, efficiency, value, and low carbon policies in the development process. As a low-carbon fossil energy, natural gas will be a partner for the long-term integrated development of renewable energy in the process of achieving the ""dual carbon"" goal. In order to achieve net zero emission of natural gas in the whole industry chain, natural gas consumption will gradually develop towards large-scale utilization of electricity, industry, and CCUS. Natural gas fields, pipelines, gas storage, and LNG terminals will form a more flexible energy supply system.

This Special Issue aims to unite the efforts of researchers around the world to look at the research progress of natural gas pipelines and LNG from a diversified perspective, and to carry out more in-depth discussions on key technologies of natural gas pipeline transportation, new energy storage and transportation, unconventional transportation technology, and pipeline digital transformation technology.

This building -- Support Center 1 -- is home to some of the company's executives and is connected to the company's dairy, which has around 350 workers. The bread and bun bakery is in the upper left. (Kwik Trip)

When your low-fuel light flashes and you pull into a Kwik Star to gas up, you may not even notice the shopping carts.

But ""we're a grocery store that happens to sell gas and cigarettes,"" said Jay Ellingson, chief food scientist for Kwik Trip Inc. ""That's how I see it.""

Founder Don Zietlow set the family-owned company's course after buying out his partners in 2000. He embarked on an aggressive growth strategy built around the idea of Kwik Trip as the new corner store, the only source for groceries in some communities.

That's an opportunity in Iowa, where 43 percent of the grocery stores in towns under 1,000 population closed between 1995 and 2005, according to Peggy Stover, director of the Marketing Institute and associate professor at the University of Iowa's Tippie School of Business.

""It is expensive to operate a grocery store,"" Stover wrote in an email. ""The profit margins are low single digits, and workers are in short supply. Many of them are shuttering in rural parts of the USA. So, c-stores are becoming a substitute for residents to fill the gap.""

Ellingson said the company leaders thought if their stores were going to sell food, ""we've got to do it right. We realized we had a potential niche because in some of the areas we do business in we were essentially the only place in town to sell food products. Today, they call them food deserts.""

Vertical integration -- in which a company makes in-house the products it sells, rather than relying on external suppliers -- is critical to the strategy.

You won't find a Kwik Trip in Iowa, Illinois, or South Dakota, where the stores are branded Kwik Star to avoid confusion with Oklahoma-based Quik Trip.

""Quik Trip with a 'Q' was there before us,"" said Amy Dupont, Kwik Trip public relations and tour specialist. ""When you hear 'quick trip' on the radio, you don't know which one it is.""

Eighty percent of the food products sold at more than 875 Kwik Trips in six states is produced on its 141-acre campus on the north end of La Crosse, Wis.

About 4,500 people work there on three shifts, producing everything from Glazers doughnuts -- 47 million of them last year -- to Nature's Touch ice cream and milk and the drinks sold in plastic jugs and bottles that are also produced in-house.

""People don't realize we make all this stuff,"" Dupont said.

The sweets bakery opened in 1988 and today is 245,000 square feet. It consumes 9,000 pounds of flour a day, just to keep the dough from sticking on the line, plus tons more in the product, which also require 18,000 pounds of filling a day.

White-garbed workers place each cinnamon roll -- 5 million a year -- by hand on the baking pans and cooling racks.

The bread and bun bakery, the size of an aircraft hangar, opened in 2017.

""It takes 11 people to make that bagel,"" Dupont said at one station. ""Bread that's made on Thursday is in your store no later than Saturday.""

Finished, packaged products and nearly all vendor products move through the Kwik Trip Distribution Center where 700 co-workers work around the clock to load truck and send products to 875 stores. Each truckload stocks four to six stores.

The milk sold in its stores -- 25 million gallons last year -- comes from farms in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin within 150 miles of its headquarters. The dairy can produce up to 8,000 gallons of ice cream a day in two dozen flavors.

""I've been in the dairy business for 35 years,"" said Al Bollinger, who oversees ice cream production. ""It's in my blood.""

""I worked for Kwik Trip all through college, so I worked in retail for four years,"" said food technologist Katarina Nemitz. ""I went off and got my big-girl job after graduating college in St. Cloud (Minn.), in a cheese plant. When we moved back to Wisconsin that was one of the first things, working at Kwik Trip again.""

Don Zietlow was 88 when he retired in December 2022. His son, Scott Zietlow, at the time a Mayo Clinic trauma surgeon, succeeded him as president and CEO.

The elder Zietlow left his mark: Each Kwik Trip-branded plastic jug of milk or bottle of water, tea, lemonade or juice has a tiny, smiling face molded into the bottom.

""A little bit of an Easter egg,"" Dupont said as she showed a visitor through the plant that molds the bottles. ""A tribute to Don.""

Similar, larger doodles by Zietlow hang in offices and corridor walls at the company's headquarters.

""I use the smiley face as a reminder to treat our customers good and do it with a smile and be happy about it,"" Zietlow told the TV show ""Discover Wisconsin"" in 2022.

Zietlow, who grew up on farms in the La Crosse area, was working as truck driver delivering to grocery stores when he and a partner opened the first Kwik Trip in Eau Claire in 1965.

The partners opened several locations around Eau Claire before their first La Crosse store in 1971. Two years later, they built a distribution center and offices in La Crosse, a city of 52,000 on the Mississippi River.

Producing some 65 million plastic bottles a year is also ""probably our best example of vertical integration,"" Dupont said, a decision based around the realization that ""when you're shipping empty bottles, you're shipping air.""

While the average Kwik Trip customer -- 11.5 million of them in 202 -- spends around three minutes in the store -- usually just to gas up -- the expanded role defines the company's place in a competitive industry.

""In the USA, c-stores are seen as a transactional shopping experience,"" the UI's Stover said. ""You gas up or buy a few snacks and go. There's no lingering around, and it's not a personalized experience, whereas in other parts of the world (mainly Europe), it's the opposite. In Europe, c-stores are viewed as an extension of a grocery/supermarket with great focus on prepared foods.""

Kwik Trip's vertical integration strategy led the company to invest in product development that others might outsource to suppliers.

""We like to think of ourselves as a food destination so we're not just looking at other convenience stores,"" said Kevin Buttner, manager of production research and development and a third-generation owner. ""We're looking at what restaurants are doing (and) grocery stores. We're looking at all the different channels to see what's going on.""

""We spend a lot of time monitoring emerging trends in the food-service world, while also keeping in mind what's approachable to our guests in the Midwest,"" said senior food researcher and product development manager Isaac Wilde, a classically trained chef who studied at the Culinary Institute of America and worked in restaurants, hotels and resorts before joining Kwik Trip.

The product development team's most recent major project brought last October's launch of the Kwikery line of fully cooked meats, ""probably the most innovative things that Kwik Trip has launched in a little while,"" Wilde said.

Designed for customers to take home and build a meal around -- perhaps using recipes designed by Wilde -- the product ""really touches almost everybody in the company,"" according to food technologist Lacey Holcomb. ""They're fully prepared proteins that we're manufacturing here in our kitchens, so all the hard work is essentially completed for the consumer.""

Owning the production process is an advantage when developing new products.

""You're looking at how your new product will be offered in the store, how it fits in the store, and how they're going to be picking that product and how you're going to be shipping it to the store,"" Holcomb said. ""It's really the whole picture of the company.""

Ellingson, the chief food scientist and a molecular biologist who's worked at Iowa State University and the USDA lab in Ames, came to Kwik Trip in 2006 to develop and open its Food Protection Lab.

""(Don Zietlow) made the decisions that we've got to have a system in place that manages the risk as product comes in through our supply chain through our production areas all the way out to retail,"" he said.

The lab analyzes samples from all of the production lines -- more than 16,000 tests a month.

""We make it, we ship it, we sell it ourselves,"" Ellingson said. ""It's a great way to reduce costs for the consumer. It also puts the risk on us. You can have all these programs in place, but at the end of the day, the science doesn't lie. We are the safety net.""

Ellingson opens the lab to invited guests every September.

""We invite our vendors, the government, our competition to that event,"" he said. ""We have them take a look under the hood. We let them see everything that we do because we think we all need to do it right.""

Vertical integration and long-standing company policy helped the company navigate COVID's supply and workforce disruptions.

Post-pandemic, the company raised wages -- a new store worker makes $16 an hour in Cedar Rapids, $15 in smaller communities. After six weeks of training in La Crosse, assistant store managers with at least a year's experience make $53,000 a year, according to the company's website.

""We've put a huge focus on our retention,"" public relations specialist Ben Liebl said. ""The retail industry has some of the highest turnover rates -- well over 100 percent. Our turnover rate is right around 50 percent. A big reason for that we believe is our culture. We put such a heavy emphasis on taking care of people.""

That includes Don Zietlow's decision to return 40 percent of pretax profits to its employees -- called co-workers -- regardless of rank or position within the company.

""I said, 'If I ever own a company, I'm going to share the profits with the people who make the money for the company,' "" he recalled in that 2022 interview.

As a private, family-owned company, Kwik Trip does not release its financials.

The National Association of Convenience Stores counted 152,396 convenience stores nationwide last year, a 1.5-percent increase over 2022.

Kwik Trip's 875 stores makes it the nation's eighth-largest chain, according to the association, trailing sound-alike QuikTrip's 992. Iowa fixture Casey's is third-largest, with 2,489 stores. Another Iowa-based chain, Kum & Go, was sold by its family owners last year to Utah-based Maverik, which plans to rebrand the 400-plus Kum & Go stores in 13 states.

That's a convenience store for every 2,225 Americans, but there are still opportunities to expand, Liebl said.

""Our real estate team, when they go out and look for a property, they'll look at car counts and see how busy the traffic is,"" he said. ""They'll see if there's an empty vacant lot. If it's commercial, are there plans for the rest of that to get built up? If it's residential, we try and get that spot early to let everything come around us after that. We try and pick those prime locations based on what the future looks like.""

Stover isn't so sure the industry will continue to grow at its current rate.

""In my personal opinion, the c-store landscape in the USA is becoming saturated,"" Stover wrote in an email, noting one out of every three stores in the U.S. is a convenience store and 93 percent of Americans live within minutes of one.

""With saturation comes the fight for market share,"" Stover said. ""C-stores who want to stay competitive need to evolve.""

Kwik Trip plans to build 13 new Kwik Star stores in Iowa this year, adding to the current 140, Liebl said.

That perhaps never was more evident than before the Miami Heat's game on Wednesday night at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

In the home-team interview room, Cleveland Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff was recalling a harrowing incident last season when a gambler got his phone number and began making threatening calls.

Down the hall, moments later in the visitor's interview room, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was relating a story of a gambler so intent on a desired outcome last season that the team had to have the spectator ejected.

Both conversations came in an arena that houses a Caesars-operated sportsbook.

For years, through partnerships and sponsorships, this has been the direction steered by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who in an op-ed piece a decade ago in the New York Times wrote, ""Sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight.""

The glare arguably never has been brighter, with the NBA this past week announcing that live betting would be coming to NBA League Pass -- watch while wagering.

That was among the reasons the topic was broached ahead of the Heat's victory over the Cavaliers.

It led to answers both unexpected and concerning.

""I do think it's somewhat contradictory,"" Spoelstra said of the NBA aggressively and emphatically moving into the gambling space. ""I think it treads on a weird line, for sure.""

That led to Spoelstra revealing the disquieting moment last season.

""We had an incident behind our bench last year with Vic Oladipo,"" Spoelstra said. ""Somebody was screaming. Security had to take him away. The game was already over, and evidently, he didn't shoot an open three at the end of the game. The game was already decided, and this fan was totally beside himself, and he was a gambler. He had money on whatever the score was.""

As with many teams, the Heat feature gambling signage on their court at Kaseya Center.

Then there was Bickerstaff's more profound perspective.

""They got my telephone number and were sending me crazy messages about where I live and my kids and all that stuff,"" Bickerstaff said, with the gambler later identified but no charges filed. ""It is a dangerous game and a fine line that we're walking for sure.""

While the NBA's newest feature with League Pass will be limited to point spreads, over-unders and moneyline odds at legal outlets in various jurisdictions, the reality is that a variety of apps offer real-time lines and constantly updated player propositions.

In other words, action all the time, even in blowouts, even in games involving teams that have no incentive to win.

Featured Local Savings

""It brings added pressure,"" Bicklerstaff said. ""It brings a distraction to the game that can be difficult for players, coaches, referees, everybody that's involved in it. And I think that we really have to be careful with how close we let it get to the game and the security of the people who are involved in it.""

Even something rudimentary as the overall betting line, as Spoelstra noted with the Oladipo incident, can become intrusive, particularly where such bets are legal, where there is no need to remain surreptitious about having money on the line.

""The amount of times,"" Bickerstaff said, ""where I'm standing up there and we may have a 10-point lead and the spread is 11 and people are yelling at me to leave the guys in so that we can cover the spread, it's ridiculous.""

And yet it also is what Silver, the NBA and every other sports league are looking for -- action with enough juice to juice interest even when the outcome would otherwise stand irrelevant.

In every NBA locker room there is signage of hard-and-fast rules against gambling involvement by any member of a team. Such signage states that team representatives are prohibited from wagering on any NBA, WNBA, G League, NBA 2K League or Basketball Africa League game, tipping (specifically, nonpublic, proprietary or other sensitive NBA or team information, such as a player's injury status or his likelihood of playing in a game), as well, of course, as directly altering the outcome.

From there, players sit on benches with gambling advertisement at their feet.

This past week, that had Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton noting: ""To half the world, I'm just helping them make money on DraftKings or whatever ... I'm the prop.""

A former Heat player who now is a coach said the slope is beyond slippery, the betting lines so public that it is difficult not to be aware that a late basket in an already-decided game could result in a payoff for the home fans.

""You still have to play the game without thinking about gambling,"" the coach said, with anonymity granted because of the sensitivity of the subject. ""I think you have to hold the ball. We do that for sportsmanship in the first place. I think you still have to be consistent with that. You can't go out of your way to make people money and things like that. I think that's where it becomes a little sketchy.""

Another former Heat player with European ties said it is an evolution in the NBA that already has taken hold elsewhere.

""It is an interesting topic,"" he said. ""And if I'm honest, it's hard to give an answer. Back in Europe, in those minor leagues, players bet on themselves, their own teams.""

This is where the NBA stands. No turning back.

""It changes the atmosphere,"" a former Heat player said. ""But it can't change the way you do things.""

But it can change and has changed the spectator/participant dynamic.

""There's just a lot of unintended consequences with that, from a security standpoint,"" Spoelstra said, ""that I'm not sure everybody totally understood when it became allowed.""

The dunes sagebrush lizard, otherwise known as a the sand dune lizard, is a small, light brown lizard that is native to West Texas and New Mexico. It is so small in fact, that they only measure around two inches in length.

They are a relatively new species, only being recognized as their own species as of 1992. Since then, in just 30 years, they are now on their way to being named an endangered species as they are considered 'functionally extinct' in 47 percent of their native range.

Due to primarily road construction that came with oil, gas, and sand extraction, their population has been dwindling fast.

Texas A&M herpetologist, Lee Fitzgerald, has been studying these lizards since the 90s and is currently fighting to get them added to the endangered species list, hoping to save them from total extinction.

If they get the endangered title, it would restrict land use within their habitat, potentially preserving them as a species and preventing the loss of this little lizard entirely.",newstalk940.com,news,NewsTalk 940 AM,,0.003921568627450966,448971644,26,https://townsquare.media/site/189/files/2024/03/attachment-sage-lizard.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89,

I don't give a (bad word) about five or six playoff games a year, since it never amounted to a ring. He is so average too many times per year and does not make others better. They all play better when he's out or not holding the ball - P.M.

A: No, he makes teammates better with his assist and defense help, so let's not allow that to get lost in the Jimmy Butler equation. But with all the missed time annually, and with all the meandering through certain regular-season games, it comes down to what it always comes down to with Jimmy Butler: You are paying him for the playoffs. Jimmy's salary is what any team would pay a player if it knew the investment would mean advancing to the conference finals in four of his five seasons under contract. So you can look at it as Jimmy Butler perhaps not being worth the $551,000 he is being paid per game (even those he doesn't play) over the 82-game regular season. Or you could look at it as the $3.7 million he gets paid for each of the 12 victories in the first three rounds of the playoffs. So, yes, if no playoff success, then money that can be questioned. Therefore, we remain in a holding pattern with the 2023-24 assessment.

Q: Can we all admit that the Patty Mills experience has failed? - Aviv, Miami.

A: Not if you can appreciate that the reason he was signed was for insurance, and not to be the starter he has had to be the past two games, plus the role he had in previous games. With Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson available, Patty Mills stands as insurance, perhaps called upon to hit one or two big shots. This high-usage role was not what was envisioned when he signed.

Q: Interesting how now if you watch games closely, when the Heat go zone, teams move the ball, flash someone in the middle, and generally are getting good shots. They've figured it out. Meanwhile, the Pelicans throw a zone at the Heat and players immediately start chucking up 3s. - Douglas.

A: The difference is when the Heat go zone, other teams have put enough 3-point shooters on the floor to at least create gaps, creases and seams in the zone. With the way the Heat were shooting 3-pointers on Friday night, and with whom they had available for those 3-pointers, New Orleans might have played as tightly packed a zone as we have seen this season, which also aided with their huge advantage on the boards.

The extraction of coal produces large volumes of waste rock (WR) that are sometimes sulphide rich (principally containing iron sulphides such as pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS)), with varying quantities of trace elements such as As, Si, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo and Cr etc). Such waste is environmentally sensitive due to the risk of oxidation in presence of atmospheric oxygen and water. Sulphide oxidation may result in acidic waters (acid mine drainage, AMD), which often contains high loads of dissolved metals. Coal combustion results in large amounts of fly ash (FA), which also is of environmental concern. However, FA is alkaline and may potentially be used for neutralisation of AMD. Therefore, the AMD producing potential of WR from coal mining and the neutralisation potential of FAs from coal and biomass combustion was studied with the ultimate goal to develop a methodology to decrease the environmental problems related to these materials.WR was sampled form the Lakhra coal field in Pakistan, which has an estimated coal reserve of 1.3 Bton, from lignite to sub-bituminous in quality. The WR samples were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods and the acid producing potential was determined by static (Acid Base Accounting) and kinetic (modified humidity cells test) methods. Besides organic material, the WRs are composed of quartz, pyrite, kaolinite, hematite and gypsum with varying amounts of calcite, lime, malladerite, spangolite, franklinite and birnessite. The Lakhra WR has strong potential to generate AMD (-70 to -492 kg CaCO3/ton) and pollute natural waters by leaching of elements such as Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and SO42-. Three different FAs based on the origin, fuel type and storage methods were studied. They were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods, the leachability was studied by batch leaching tests and the potential for buffering acids and neutralisation of AMD was quantified. Fly ash from burning i) brown coal (lignite) in Pakistan (PK), ii) black (bituminous) coal from Finland (FI) and iii) biomass FA provided by a sulphate pulp and paper mill in Sweden (SE) were studied. All ashes contained quarts, PK also iron oxide, anhydrite, and magnesioferrite, FI also mullite and lime, and SE also calcite and anorthite. All ashes were enriched in As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn compared to continental crust, and all ashes had a strong neutralisation potential, the bioash, SE, in particular. The results are encouraging and suggest that it is possible to use FA to mitigate the environmental problems with coal mine WR.

With only 12 games remaining, it will be difficult for Miami to secure a top seed barring a miracle. That means they will face a tougher opponent in the first round of the playoffs. However, some opponents are much tougher than others. There are a few teams the Heat will want to avoid in the postseason, while they might feel comfortable taking their chances against other opponents.

Here are two teams the Miami Heat will want to avoid in the first round, and two ideal matchups.

It is difficult to predict what to expect from the New York Knicks this postseason. The Knicks are currently dealing with several injuries. It could be argued that it would be better to face the Knicks early and knock them out before they can get healthy. However, if everything goes right for them and their key players return before the playoffs, they will be a tough team to beat.

The Knicks have a 15-2 record when OG Anunoby plays. Their defensive efficiency as a collective unit is one of the best in the NBA. The Knicks have missed Julius Randle since late January, who will provide an all-around boost for the team in the postseason if healthy. Jalen Brunson has been playing at an All-NBA level. He has ramped up his scoring, averaging over 40 points over a recent three-game stretch.

Brunson was arguably the best player in the series when the Heat and the Knicks faced each other in the Conference Semifinals last postseason. The Heat had a difficult time stopping Brunson from scoring, who averaged 31 points per game in the series. He helped turn the series into one of the most competitive ones Miami faced on their way to the Finals. This is a much better Knicks team than the Heat faced last year. They are ramping up for the playoffs and if they get healthy at the right time, they could be a threat.",allucanheat.com,news,All U Can Heat,,0.1764705882352942,448971032,1,"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7076,h_3980,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/115/01hsgmqypzd1kwkse23z.jpg",eng-9420651

Internal combustion engine automobiles, buses, trucks, lorries and coaches would be stranded. Airplanes powered by jet fuel would be grounded. Freight and passenger rail powered by diesel would halt. People could not get to work; children could not get to school. The shipping industry, transporting both freight and passengers, would be devastated.

There would be no point calling emergency services. The majority of ambulances, fire engines, police cars, rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles would be stationary. Most phones and computers would also vanish as their plastic components derive from oil, so it would be a struggle to find a way of communicating with the emergency services anyway.

The construction sector would halt, as diesel powered vehicles would be stranded: excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, cranes, cement mixers, rollers and compact loaders would remain stationary. New homes or buildings could not be built or receive vital maintenance work.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, petroleum based-products would vanish with it. This would impact the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Aside from the supply chains disruption, the structure of lithium-ion batteries would be affected. A lithium-ion battery has four parts: an anode, cathode, electrolyte and a separator. Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene petroleum-based products. The petroleum-derived synthetic rubber used on car and bicycle tyres would cease to exist.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, food production would be devastated. Many of the vehicles necessary in agriculture ̶ tractors, mowers, combine harvesters, balers, sprayers and seeders ̶ would stop working. Food packaging necessary for storage and preservation would not be available. Petroleum coke, a by-product in oil refining, is used as a feedstock in manufacturing synthetic fertilizers, which are important in increasing crop yields. Food shortages and the knock on impacts would likely ensue.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, it would be catastrophic for health services everywhere. Staff would lack mobility, and essential supplies would be stranded. Beyond transportation, petroleum is an essential feedstock for pharmaceuticals, plastics and medical supplies.

Latex gloves, medical tubes, medical syringes, adhesives, some bandages, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, cleaning agents, prosthetics, artificial heart valves, resuscitation masks, stethoscopes, MRI scanners, insulin pens, infusion bags, medication packaging, face-masks, and Personal Protection Equipment are largely derived from petroleum-based materials. The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

It is difficult to conceive of a modern hospital without this range of essential petroleum-based products.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, the renewables industry would be impacted. The fibreglass, resin or plastic necessary for the construction of most wind turbines, would disappear. The ethylene used in the production of solar panels would vanish. Most of the mining vehicles ̶ large trucks, rotary drill rigs and rock drills ̶ necessary to extract the critical minerals upon which the production of solar photovoltaic plants, wind farms and EVs depend, would become stationary.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, homes would be transformed beyond recognition. There is the possibility roofs would collapse, for example, if bitumen was a key product. Other materials used in insulating homes would disappear. If you relied on heating oil to keep warm, that would go. The linoleum flooring and tiling would be impacted. Painting the walls would be a challenge. Furniture, pillows, rugs, curtains, dishes, cups and non-stick pans all are likely to be made from petroleum-derived products too.

It would be a challenge to stay clean or keep homes clean, if oil disappeared tomorrow. Laundry detergent and dish detergents usually derive from petroleum-based products. Soap, toothpaste, hand-lotion, deodorant, shampoo, shaving cream, eyeglasses, contact lenses, combs, brushes; all normally contain petroleum-derived products.

It would be a struggle to get anywhere, as the asphalt that paves roads and footpaths would vanish.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, millions of jobs would be lost. Tax revenues would be depleted. Industrial production would crimp. Economic growth would go into reverse. The plight of the fuel poor would be worsened.

This is not even the full list of everything that would be impacted, in such an unthinkable scenario.

Yet, despite these realities, there are calls saying 'Just stop oil,' 'Keep it in the ground,' or 'don't invest in new oil and gas projects.'

Of course, everybody wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced. OPEC believes that technological solutions and efficiency improvements can play a vital role. The oil industry is already proactive in this regard.

We need to be cautious of endangering the present, in the name of saving the future. It is important we all fully understand the immense benefits that oil, and the petroleum products derived from it, continue to provide to people and nations across the world.

The state's second ever three-peat came by a whopping 378 runs over Tasmania after they successfully skittled the visitors for 5-18 in the final session at the WACA Ground.

A dominant first day, where Sam Whiteman posted a century and Shield debutant Cooper Connolly came close, effectively won them the title with the Tasmanians never looking likely to overcome the advantage.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.",ktbb.com,news,KTBB,,-0.05882352941176472,448970564,1,https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png,

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient.

Western Australia's imperious cricket dynasty has scaled back to its summit -- a third consecutive Sheffield Shield title.

What is now one of the greatest sporting teams the State has ever seen claimed a three-peat for the second time -- and six consecutive trophies across two formats -- with an historic 378-run win over Tasmania with a day to spare at the WACA Ground.

Australian cricket's kings survived the entire first session without losing a wicket on day one after being sent in to bat. On day two, they slipped into third gear and were in cruise control from there until a rampaging finish on Sunday evening.

Their triumph felt inevitable once captain Sam Whiteman posted a century in a final for the second time in three years on the opening day.

Just weeks after they also won the one-day title for the third time in as many years, Joel Paris sealed the WA's 18th shield title when he took a screaming gully catch to dismiss Iain Carlisle.

Tasmania lost 5-18 to fold in the final session.

It is the second time WA have won three consecutive titles -- after Daryl Foster's team in the late-1980's -- and is the 18th time the State has claimed the shield.

WA's ace bowling attack waited in the weeds for a full day of cricket for their chance to pounce on a soulless Tasmanian batting line-up.

Hilton Cartwright fell short of a second-innings century, dismissed for 94 by Beau Webster as they piled on the runs with no motivation to declare.

It came on a morning of drama for Webster. The two-metre allrounder took a one-handed screamer at leg-slip to dismissed Aaron Hardie off Jarrod Freeman's bowling, dropped a thigh-height sitter that let Cooper Connolly off the hook and then took another catch.

He also clipped Cartwright's bail while he was on 82 and was given a scare when umpires checked a tight no-ball call after he had taken his wicket.

Cartwright had barely been challenged in Saturday's evening session or at all on Sunday morning until Tasmania finally got on top of him in a shaky five-minute period which ended in him being dismissed.

In the afternoon, WA's tail piled on the pain. Paris, Gannon and Stobo added 75 runs after Cartwright fell and took the target beyond anything seen before.

Paris copped a brute of a delivery that reared up and was caught by Webster off Iain Carlisle's bowling, but the left-hander was unconvinced the ball had struck his glove for 26 and Gannon fell on 42.

Matthew Wade's red-ball career ended when he lost balance and edged a Gannon delivery behind for three.

The lbw dismissal of Charlie Wakim drew an impassioned celebration from Joel Paris, but it didn't deter Caleb Jewell from trying his best to play booming drives against the left-hander.

At times, Tasmania appeared set to take the match into a fifth day, but when Jewell went for eight Tasmania looked ready to combust.

Jordan Silk was resolute in his 46, which came off 59 balls, but fell to Stobo.

Paris had a convincing lbw shout to dismiss Webster turned down as Corey Rocchiccioli resumed his workmanlike residency at the member's end in another probing spell.

Webster showed no interest in a long-haul innings and after surviving a convincing lbw shout from Paris, skied a ball from Gannon on 19.

Just balls later the seamer had a ball cannon into the front pad of Freeman, leaving Tasmania seven wickets down.

Gabe Bell for eight and Brad Hope for a gallant 22 left Rocchiccioli with 46 wickets at the end of a season where he has emerged as the second to only Nathan Lyon among Australian off-spinners.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient.

Another sign of the rising role of misinformation in politics: The federal government is issuing guidance to states on how to combat high-tech efforts to trick voters as the 2024 elections heat up.

Earlier this year the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency sent warnings and tips to elections officials in North Carolina and elsewhere on how to fight schemes using artificial intelligence to spread misinformation about specific candidates or even the election itself.

Here in North Carolina, the efforts to prepare for such tricks are underway.

""The State Board of Elections has been and continues to be concerned about false information about elections on the Internet and social media,"" elections board spokesman Pat Gannon said. ""The emergence of AI-driven false information in elections exacerbates these concerns.""

The 2022 elections saw the use of deepfakes -- computer-generated images and videos that use AI to trick viewers into believing they're real -- by several political campaigns in North Carolina and nationally, a trend that's continuing this year.

The Republican National Committee, for instance, launched an anti-immigration ad last year that it described as ""an AI-generated look into the country's possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected in 2024.""

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, put out an ad with AI-generated images falsely showing his top GOP primary rival, former President Donald Trump, hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, purporting that Trump supported restrictions that were unpopular with conservatives during the Covid-19 pandemic. DeSantis has since ended his 2024 presidential campaign and endorsed Trump.

Closer to home, in a 2022 GOP congressional primary the eventual winner of that race, Bo Hines, was targeted by an artificially generated ad. It took a Hines comment that was printed in a newspaper and made a recording pretending that Hines was speaking those words.

In 2024 North Carolina saw its first major AI-backed operation start up toward the end of the primary elections: A Democratic donor funded a website that used AI to fake the voice of Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson -- the GOP's nominee for governor -- reading quotes that ventured into the absurd.

Todd Stiefel, the man behind that anti-Robinson effort, defended it as political comedy and noted that the website went out of its way to make sure people knew it was meant as a joke. There's a clear ethical difference, he told WRAL when the website launched, between using AI for satire or using it to try to actually trick voters.

Robinson's Democratic opponent wasn't laughing. Josh Stein, the attorney general and Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the website in a statement from his political campaign. A spokesperson at the North Carolina Department of Justice also had previously told WRAL the department is watching closely for reports of AI being misused in the election.

""Attorney General Stein is deeply concerned about the use of AI to deceive and harm North Carolinians,"" spokeswoman Nazneen Ahmed said. ""He's pushed the federal government to look at this issue closely as it relates to child sexual abuse, and our office is taking a close look at other ways the technology can be exploited.""

It's not just North Carolina. Earlier this year authorities in New Hampshire announced a criminal investigation into a robocall that faked President Joe Biden's voice to spread election misinformation among local voters. The North Carolina State Board of Elections didn't receive reports of such issues leading up to the 2024 primary, Gannon said, but is prepared to investigate should anything occur before the Nov. 5 general election.

Opponents of government regulations that would crack down on AI cite concerns over freedom of speech issues. But some companies have begun putting their own internal regulations in place. Google, for instance, announced last year that its YouTube unit would require users to disclose whether their videos feature synthetic content. And YouTube has pledged to take down any videos that could be used for voter suppression or election misinformation. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, adopted a policy last year that will label any political ads created with AI.

While federal and state elections experts raise the alarm, it remains to be seen how much urgency North Carolina political leaders, other than Stein, will assign to concerns over the use of AI in the elections.

The fact that no new laws have been passed cracking down on AI in North Carolina ahead of the 2024 general election worries advocates like Josh Lawson. The former top lawyer for the state elections board, Lawson is now the director of ""AI and democracy"" at the Aspen Institute, a national think tank. But even while states should be beefing up their laws, he said, it'll also take a broader societal effort to raise awareness of how to spot AI-generated misinformation, and where to find real information.

""You have to proceed with two things that you're wrapping your arms around,"" Lawson said in an interview. ""One, that it is helpful for the democratic process to establish what the laws are in using this very, very powerful technology at the intersection of AI and elections. And two, to prepare for a world where certain bad actors don't care that it's illegal.""

The state legislature returns to Raleigh next month for what's likely to be a brief session focused mostly on making tweaks to the two-year state budget passed last year. When asked last month about concerns over AI influencing the elections -- and whether any changes need to be made during that session, ahead of the general election -- House Speaker Tim Moore said in an interview that he didn't see the need for new laws.

It's deeply concerning, Moore said, but he believes existing anti-defamation laws should be enough to fight back.

""Once you get their voice, once you get their image -- just off of television or whatever -- you can go in and reconstruct it, make it look like they said anything or did anything,"" Moore said. ""There's certainly a lot of danger in that. But I would submit to you that under our current laws, if someone were to engage in that kind of activity ... it probably goes along with slander and libel.""

Defamation laws could help candidates who are targeted by AI; state law also makes it a crime already to spread false information about elections.

Moore and other legislative Republicans already passed numerous changes to election laws for 2024. They banned elections officials from receiving outside grants to help bolster their budgets, they loosened the rules governing partisan poll observers, they moved up the deadline for mail-in ballots and they changed the way results are reported on election night.

Having made so many other election law changes during last year's session -- but not touching AI -- indicates it's not a priority.

However, Moore didn't entirely shut the door on the possibility of the legislature taking some sort of last-minute action against AI ahead of the November elections.

""If we need to look at it, we certainly will,"" he said. ""This is brand-new stuff, right? Just a few years ago this would've been science fiction stuff -- A Schwarzenegger futuristic movie or something. And now, here it is.""

Lawson, who lives in Raleigh, said he's helped other states write new laws preparing for AI in the elections and he'll be watching how North Carolina lawmakers proceed.

""Are we ready for it? It depends,"" he said. ""This is a live game. And the people playing it have decisions that they're going to be making in the next couple months. There are things that we can do, that will continue to make a secure process even more secure.""

The federal government hasn't passed any laws targeting election misinformation fueled by AI, although the Federal Communications Commission issued an agency rule cracking down on AI-assisted robocalls earlier this year, after the fake Biden voice made national news.

Similarly, many states have enacted laws that prohibit the use of deepfakes against private citizens. North Carolina is one of them. But only a handful -- California, Minnesota, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin -- have provisions specifically related to election campaigns, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks laws passed in each state.

Regardless of whether North Carolina passes any new laws regulating AI in elections, Gannon and Lawson both said it's important for regular people to be sure they're getting their news about candidates or the election itself from trusted, established sources.

For people who want to check if a video or audio clip is fake, there are tools online that are advertised as being able to catch AI-generated content. Fact-checking service PolitiFact, a partner of WRAL, recently looked into those and found that while those tools work some of the time, they're not fully accurate.

Elections officials themselves are also trying to become more nimble and proactive. Gannon said the elections board recently ran an exercise with election workers, law enforcement, information-technology security staffers and others on a variety of election-related issues -- and that elections staff meet routinely with law enforcement to share information about the elections and any real or potential threats.

""If we identify deepfakes or other misinformation efforts that might violate election laws, the State Board of Elections has an investigations division that can review the situation and pursue a criminal case, if warranted,"" Gannon said. ""Our local, state and federal law enforcement partners may also become involved, depending on the situation.""

The documents the federal government recently sent the state elections board enumerate the ways AI could be used to manipulate voters in the elections. The trickery, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, could come from domestic sources or foreign governments.

""AI capabilities present opportunities for increased productivity, potentially enhancing both election security and election administration,"" the CISA report said. ""However, these capabilities also carry the increased potential for greater harm, as malicious actors, including foreign nation state actors and cybercriminals, could leverage these same capabilities for nefarious purposes. For the 2024 election cycle, generative AI capabilities will likely not introduce new risks, but they may amplify existing risks to election infrastructure.""",wral.com,news,WRAL,Will Doran,-0.2470588235294118,448968824,1,https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/political/2024/03/13/21327907/media_3676d99759e34c06bc3b9aa8421cb872-DMID1-629bg2kjc-1066x711.jpg,

The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

The equipment used in medical research such as microscopes, test tubes and goggles usually contain petroleum-derived components.

The chemical synthesis that creates aspirin begins with benzene, which is derived from petroleum. The benzene is converted to phenol, which in turn is converted to salicylic acid. This is then transformed into acetylsalicylic acid, which the world knows as aspirin.

It is difficult to conceive of a modern hospital without this range of essential petroleum-based products.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, the renewables industry would be impacted. The fibreglass, resin or plastic necessary for the construction of most wind turbines, would disappear. The ethylene used in the production of solar panels would vanish. Most of the mining vehicles ̶ large trucks, rotary drill rigs and rock drills ̶ necessary to extract the critical minerals upon which the production of solar photovoltaic plants, wind farms and EVs depend, would become stationary.

If oil disappeared tomorrow, homes would be transformed beyond recognition. There is the possibility roofs would collapse, for example, if bitumen was a key product. Other materials used in insulating homes would disappear. If you relied on heating oil to keep warm, that would go. The linoleum flooring and tiling would be impacted. Painting the walls would be a challenge. Furniture, pillows, rugs, curtains, dishes, cups and non-stick pans all are likely to be made from petroleum-derived products too.

It would be a challenge to stay clean or keep homes clean, if oil disappeared tomorrow. Laundry detergent and dish detergents usually derive from petroleum-based products.

This is not even the full list of everything that would be impacted, in such an unthinkable scenario.

Yet, despite these realities, there are calls saying 'Just stop oil,' 'Keep it in the ground,' or 'don't invest in new oil and gas projects.'

Of course, everybody wants to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced. OPEC believes that technological solutions and efficiency improvements can play a vital role. The oil industry is already proactive in this regard.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has said that Nigeria would need between $10 billion and $15 billion in the next two to three years to ramp up its existing gas infrastructure.

The Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, gave the estimate at the 2024 edition of CERAWeek, a global oil and gas event in Houston, the United States, organised by S&P Global.

The programme which ended on Friday was themed: ""Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, Climate, Technology and Geopolitics.""

Kyari argued that the main focus of the NNPC at the moment, is building capacity to deliver gas into the domestic market, reiterating that Nigeria remains a gas country with associated oil rather than the other way round.

Nigeria has over 208 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of proven gas reserves and about 600 TCF in potential reserves, but can hardly get the resource out of the ground due to lack of infrastructure and the much-needed investment in the sector.

But highlighting the ongoing conversations around energy transition, the NNPCL GCEO noted that the country takes the issue of energy availability very seriously as well as the cheapest route to explore it.

The NNPC's chief executive argued that there is now a clear opportunity that gas has on Sunday, which wasn't there 10 years ago, explaining that the NNPC and its partners are building a number of trunk lines that will supply gas within the network.

According to the GCEO, within the next three to four years, there will likely be in-country gas infrastructure to raise supply, especially domestically.

""What we see is that we will probably need between $10 billion to $15 billion in two to three years. That should cover the immediate gap. And of course, looking beyond providing gas in the domestic market, which is to see how relationships and partnerships can create gas for export.

""And of course, when you look at that, and then probably you see another incremental $10 billion to $12 billion which will create the opportunity for growth,"" he stated.

Besides, the NNPC helmsman said that there is an ongoing engagement, which has reached a very advanced stage to create a pipeline that can pass through 13 African countries into Morocco and then to Europe, estimated at $25 billion.

He mentioned the ongoing construction of the NLNG Train 7, expressing the hope that it will likely double Nigeria's current capacity in the liquefied natural gas space when completed.

""Also, we are working on two other projects.

One is the fixed LNG project and we have reached an advanced stage of commitment so that we can bring back another 10 million tonnes facility in the country, and several other floating LNG projects.

""But obviously, we have a line of sight around at least three to four LNG projects. We are also engaging our partners to see how we can add another train on the LNG making it eight. We see huge opportunities,"" he pointed out.

Kyari further called for support from other countries to nations in sub-Saharan Africa, to close the energy availability gap.",arise.tv,news,Arise News,"Chioma Kalu, Ozioma Samuel-Ugwuezi, Nissi Gabriel, Melissa Enoch, Blessing Ibunge",0.07450980392156858,448967668,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.arise.tv/uploads/2023/11/Mele-Kyari.png,

A fire has reportedly broken out at a Russian oil refinery following a Ukrainian drone attack amid fears of an escalation of the war.

Russian Telegram channels reported a blaze ripped through the Kuibyshev oil refinery in the country's Samara Oblast region after local residents said they heard an explosion, according to local reports, with regional authorities saying the cause was a drone.

It comes as Moscow launched what Kyiv has called the biggest attack of the war on Ukraine's power grid in retaliation for recent strikes targeting oil refineries and other energy facilities inside Russia, signalling a potential escalation of the war just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.

Russia pounded Ukraine's power facilities on Friday, striking a vast dam over the Dnipro river, killing at least five people, leaving more than a million others across seven regions without electricity, and briefly cutting off power to a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

What this new study says - The Bobr Times,"Santé mentale : le gaz hilarant efficace contre la dépression ?

Nitrous oxide, laughing gas, has a bad press. The cause is an increase in recreational consumption among adolescents and young adults when the health risks are potentially very serious, even fatal. However, it could change the lives of depressed people who are resistant to medication.

Nitrous oxide, also known as nitrous oxide, particularly available in whipped cream siphon cartridges, be rehabilitated. ""Laughing gas lacks credibility and suffers from a bad image, particularly because of its recreational use which is not without risk"", explains Inserm .

Indeed, the one that also calls itself the proto, whose consumption has increased among 15-25 year olds in recent years, can cause serious effects. Among others: asphyxiation from lack of oxygen, cold gas burns, dizziness, disorientation, loss of consciousness and falls. ""In case of repeated consumption at short intervals and/or in high doses, severe neurological, hematological, psychiatric or cardiac disorders may occur"" , notes the Interministerial Mission to Combat Drugs and Addictive Behaviors (Mildeca).

But nitrous oxide would also be associated with antidepressant effects. Psychiatrist Thomas Desmidt from Tours University Hospital (Indre-et-Loire) highlighted them with the iBrain team from Inserm, using medical imaging. They exposed thirty women for one hour to a gas mixture containing as much O2 as N2O, called an equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Meopa). ;, the most common form of use of laughing gas in a medical environment.

Aged 25 to 50, around twenty had medication-resistant depression, the other ten were volunteers without depression. Result: exposure to Meopa, administered by mask, significantly reduced the symptoms of 45% of patients. According to Thomas Desmidt, these positive results confirm previous studies: ""positive responses to N2O in depression are of the order of 20 to 40%, after a single exposure to product"".

Functional MRI showed in nine patients a decrease in cerebral connectivity with areas of the brain known to activate simultaneously in depressed patients. ""The Meopa session allows 'to'turn off' this brain network whose hyperactivity is synonymous with depressive suffering and ruminations, explains the researcher. An ultrasound method suggests a link between the vasodilatory properties of nitrous oxide and its antidepressant effect.

These encouraging results will still need to be validated on a larger scale. It will also remain to set the percentage of N2O in the mixture, the time and the number of exposure... hellip; Several randomized therapeutic trials should emerge in depressed elderly people but also in patients who present to the emergency room with suicidal thoughts. ""In four to five years, we should have enough elements on hand, I hope, to use nitrous oxide in clinical routine&quot ;, concludes Thomas Desmidt.

Note: according to a 2021 survey, 12.5% of people aged 18 to 25 had experienced a depressive episode characterized in the 12 least which preceded the survey. The study highlighted an unprecedented acceleration in depressive episodes between 2017 and 2021. According to Inserm, characterized depressive disorder affects approximately 15 to 20% of the general population over the entire lifespan and is characterized by a succession of ;rsquo;characterized depressive episodes.

Ukraine has suffered a second day of intense bombing of its power stations, plunging half a dozen regions into darkness, as the Kremlin tries to take advantage of Kyiv's dwindling supply of air defence ammo.

At the same time, the US asked Zelenskiy's administration to curb its long-distance drone strikes on Russia's oil refineries, as production has dropped by 10% since the start of the year, threatening an oil product price strike ahead of US elections slated for this November.

On the night of March 21-22, Russian forces launched a combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine's critical infrastructure using a total of 151 aerial weapons that cost well over $300mn, according to reports.

Ukrainian air defence units managed to destroy 92 Russian aerial targets, but an increasing number of Russian missiles are getting through to hit their targets as Ukraine starts to run low on air defence ammo. Blackouts not seen for about a year were back as important power plants were struck and suffered major damage.

Emergency power outages are taking place in a number of Ukrainian regions after reports of damage to power generating facilities, the Ukrainian energy holding DTEK and regional authorities reported.

Blackouts have been reported in eight regions, including the Dnipro Region and in the Kyiv-controlled areas of the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as ""stabilisation outages"" in the Odesa Region.

According to the regional authorities, over 110,000 residents of the Poltava Region will be disconnected ""to balance the power grid"", while in the Sumy Region emergency cut-off plans will be implemented in several districts.

It appears that the Kremlin is trying to take advantage of Kyiv's increasingly dire financial state after the US ran out of money for Ukraine in January and halted supplies of badly needed weapons and ammo. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Western leaders last week to urgently send more munitions, but the Ministry of Finance (MinFin) admitted last week that Ukraine has only received 10% of the arms and cash promised last month at the 20 Ramstein meeting.

The barrage began on March 21, hitting cities across the country. A Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia on March 22 claimed the lives of three people: a father and daughter aged 35 and 8, and a 62-year-old trolleybus driver who was driving along the dam of the Dnipro hydroelectric power plant (HPP), the Kyiv Independent reports.

The target was the Dnipro HPP, a major source of power, which was struck by eight missiles and suffered extensive damage.

Ukraine is currently suffering from the most intense missile and drone attack since the start of the war more than two years ago - even more intense than the first barrage launched in January designed to run Ukrainian's stock of defensive missiles down, a tactic that now seems to be paying dividends for Russia.

Russian forces are exploiting Ukraine's air defence shortages to plunge the country into darkness and destroy the country's energy grid in the largest strike since the start of the conflict, according to a report from Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

More than 130 energy infrastructure facilities have been targeted across the country over the last two days. The Dnipro HPP is the largest facility in Ukraine and was a key target, but dozens of other power stations have also been hit and damaged, according to reports.

The Dnipro HPP is now reported to be in a critical condition after its turbine room and electrical equipment were seriously damaged, director Igor Sirota reportedly said.

""We are losing the station. The HPP-2 is in danger. We don't know at what capacity it will be able to operate. The HPP-2 is in critical condition. The HPP-1 has also stopped operations, so we are doing everything we can to raise the gates and process the water,"" Ukraine's Strana media outlet quoted him as saying.

""We will have to fully rebuild the turbine room and repair electrical equipment,"" he added, noting that there was no threat of a dam break.

The current onslaught has sent residents of cities around Ukraine scuttling back into air raid shelters that haven't been much used since the last assault on Ukraine's power infrastructure in the winter of 2022.

The air defences provided by the US and European allies have proved so effective that bne IntelliNews' correspondent in Kyiv reported the locals had become increasingly blasé about air raid siren alerts, often choosing to ignore them and continue going about their business. But that has changed dramatically in the few last days as the combination of falling levels of ammo and the sheer intensity of the attack have driven people underground again.

The skies are open again to a Russian assault that threatens to repeat the destruction of half the country's energy infrastructure, as occurred in the winter 2022 campaign. The Washington Post recently reported that the shortage of air defence ammo has become so acute that Kyiv may soon be limited to being able to shoot down only one in five inbound missiles.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the ISW said.

With international supplies of weapons falling off, Ukraine's strategy is to become a military production hub and make more of the arms and ammo it needs at home. Depriving Ukraine of power will make that task a lot harder.

Ukraine launched a counter-punch in February that is also designed to run down Russia's ability to supply its forces and earn money to run its war machine by targeting Russia's oil refineries with long-range missiles.

However, the Financial Times reported last week that the US has urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, warning senior SBU and GUR officials that drone strikes risk driving up global oil prices and provoking retaliation.

Russia crude oil refining production has dropped to a ten-month low and is down at 5mn barrels per day (bpd) from March 14-20, or a 10% fall year on year. after Ukraine began a drone war in February using new long-range domestically produced drones to attack Russia's refining capacity deep inside Russian territory.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak denied that Washington had called on Kyiv to halt the drone strikes on Russian assets.

""This is fictitious information. After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for waging this war. Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of warfare. Fuel is the basic tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy its fuel infrastructure,"" Podolyak said as cited by Ukrayinska Pravda.

Podolyak argued that Russia is in the midst of a major attack against Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure with genocidal intentions, while Ukraine has responded with its own attacks against the Russian infrastructure of war.

Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, followed up saying that Russia's oil refineries are ""legitimate targets of Ukraine from a military point of view."" According to her, Ukraine is acting in accordance with Nato standards in this case, in statements that defy the US concerns.

""We understand the requests of American partners. But we wage war with the capabilities, resources and practices that are available to us,"" she said during the second Ukrainian Security Forum.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on his Nato allies to ""close the skies"" from the very first week of the war, but Nato has never responded, leaving Ukraine vulnerable to missile attacks. The supply of sophisticated anti-missile systems, and the US-made Patriot system in particular - have alleviated the problem somewhat, but the Patriot missiles are expensive and in short supply, whereas Russia has ramped up the production of cheap weaponised drones that it is firing at Ukraine in their droves.

Commenting on the hostile attack by the Russians on March 22, Stefanishyna welcomed the words of support from Ukraine's Western allies, but words alone are insufficient, given the scale and intensity of the current attack.

""I want to draw attention to the fact that the situation is already very bad... Over the past two months we have received 10% of the planned financial resources necessary for the survival of the state, and also have not received military assistance, which was planned for almost a year within the Ramstein format by more than 50 countries around the world,"" Stefanishyna said. ""Reaction is one thing, but we expect weapons first of all.""",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.5058823529411764,448966040,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Ukraine_industry_factory_energy_power_station_electricity_business_0.jpeg,eng-9416762

Bosses at the Petroineos plant in Grangemouth established almost a century ago, had told staff that Scotland ""simply won't be big enough to support a fuels refinery"" due to falling demand putting at risk jobs both within the plant as well as outside contractors.

UK and Scottish ministers have offered no hope of intervening to save the key refinery as it emerged North Sea revenues over two years are set to soar to £17.25bn.

The refinery is symbolic of Scotland's 'black gold' which would be used by the Scottish National Party during the 1970s in making their economic case for independence from the rest of the UK. It was argued that North Sea oil would not benefit the nation to any significant degree while the nation remained part of the United Kingdom.

Company sources had said that the size of the losses in previous years incurred by the company were at a level that could not be sustained by any government support.

""It would not be economically viable,"" said a source.

The company that operates the refinery had at that point made total losses of £361.64m in 2020 and 2021.

It came as the value of its assets including the old refinery, equipment and other property declined by £383m as of 2021 described as an 'impairment loss'.

That came after Petroineos cut the capacity of the refinery with an estimated loss of up to 200 jobs in 2020, as the hit to fuel demand from the coronavirus pandemic hit profits across the industry.

But now the Herald can reveal that Petroineos Manufacturing Scotland Limited, which owns and operates the refinery has made a record pre-tax profit of £107,476,000, following a £50.568m loss the previous year with company bosses admitted that the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 had had a ""pervasive effect"" on the business.

Its previous profit high in recent years was the £25.20m gained in 2017.

A February briefing by director Andrew Pizzey, has stated that it had seen a ""full recovery"" from Covid with ""all product grades back to pre-pandemic levels"". ""As a consequence, the business expects to have another good year, despite unavoidable disruption to throughput as the refienry performs a turnaround on its hydrocracker complex,"" he said.

It has been estimated that £60-80m would be needed to re-start the hydrocracking unit at Grangemouth which some say will pave the way to profitability and a lifeline for the refinery and hundreds of jobs.

In general, major products produced from hydrocracking are jet fuel and diesel but Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) can also be produced.

Experts say the cost of repairing the Grangemouth unit which went offline in April, last year, and has not been working since has played a key part in its anticipated closure.

But Mr Pizzey said that the longer-term outlook for European refining remains ""challenging"" and that the aim is to operate the refinery ""with a lower base cost structure"".

Former justice secretary now East Lothian MP and Alba Party deputy leader Kenny MacAskill, who has been leading a fight to save the refinery said: ""The plant is profitable and a fraction of the revenue from North Sea oil allows it to be further increased.

""North Sea oil is and has been pivotal to the UK economy. It's perverse that Scotland's oil should be refined elsewhere and that Scotland's industrial base is trashed whilst the UK Treasury coins in the cash.""

He has been calling for a tiny fraction of the profits from the North Sea to save the refinery.

""If Grangemouth is allowed to shut Scotland will be the only major oil producing nation without a refinery,"" he said ""It will put us alongside developing nations such as the Republic of Congo and Trinidad and Tobago both of whom produce less oil than Scotland.

""The UK has made billions from North Sea oil. They're providing hundreds of millions to Ineos to open a plant in Belgium and have funded foreign battery plants in England to a similar tune. Its time a modest sum was given to Grangemouth from all the billions taken from the North Sea to shore up Scotlands economy.""

Staff were told in November that a start had been made on projects that would see the Grangemouth plant transition from a refinery to potentially an imported fuels depot over the next five years.

Refinery owner Petroineos - the joint venture between Ineos Group - the petrochemicals giant controlled by billionaire tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe - and China's state-backed PetroChina - which bought the refinery in 2005, said it will remain a refinery until spring 2025 and that jobs would remain safe in the short term.

The campaign to save the refinery has been supported by legendary Scots band The Proclaimers who have stated in a video message (above) that it cannot be ""Grangemouth No More"".

Their comments are a reference to their 1987 hit 'Letter From America' which featured on their debut studio Album This is the Story.

The famous lyrics of ""Bathgate no more, Linwood, no more Methil no more, Irvine no more..."" are a reference to the decline of Scottish industry in the 1980s.

According to Petroineos, it has a refining capacity of 150,000 barrels per day while Grangemouth plays a leading role in supplying Scotland's fuel demand, and is of strategic importance to the nation's energy supply and regional economic development.

It is connected to the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) for its crude oil intake from the North Sea and connected to Finnart Ocean Terminal for crude oil import and finished products export.

In November 2020 it emerged that two production plants at the site, which had not been operational since the Covid lockdown the previous March were being mothballed. It said the move will reduce future operating costs at the site.

A few months earlier, the energy firm sought a government loan package worth hundreds of millions of pounds amid low oil demand which was triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

The request for the joint venture's loan followed Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's move to Monaco for what were alleged to be tax reasons.

It is understood Petroineos had been in talks for weeks with the Scottish and UK governments about a loan package.

Ineos said at the time: ""It should not come as any surprise that the refinery is talking to the government at a time when demand for fuel has fallen significantly during the period of lockdown,"" before adding that ""the request is not from Ineos but from Petroineos, a 50-50 joint venture between Ineos and Petrochina"".

The joint-venture believed it could have ""a viable longer-term business"" employing up to 450 workers at the site. In 2020 there were 637 full-time staff there.

At the time, Scotland's infrastructure secretary Michael Matheson described the job losses as ""devastating"" and vowed the Scottish Government would do everything it could to help affected employees.

Energy minister Gillian Martin has expressed ambitions for Grangemouth to become ""world leaders in biofuels/sustainable aviation fuel"".

But Grangemouth bosses have raised serious doubt over a transition to a green fuel biorefinery saying the current position is ""commercially suboptimal"".

Much of the losses in the pandemic-hit years of 2020 and 2021 were down to what is called an ""impairment charge"" which relates to a drop in the value of its property, which counts as a loss on financial statements.

Some £383m dropped from its value, in the wake of resizing its operations from November 2020. It then announced the closure of one of its crude distillation units and its fluid catalytic cracking unit.

The cut in capacity of the refinery led to an estimated loss of up to 200 jobs in 2020, as the hit to fuel demand from the coronavirus pandemic hit profits across the industry.

Petroineos has commenced early study work focused on the future establishment of a biofuels refinery at Grangemouth capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel.

And the Scottish Government hope that Grangemouth will become home to ""Scotland's only sustainable aviation fuel production plant, capable of meeting future aviation demands for decades to come"".

But Petroineos while noting the ambitions has indicated that there were ""fiscal and policy obstacles"".

It centres around on the UK cap on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from oils and fats feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO).

And Iain Hardie, head of legal affairs has said the cap will need to be addressed as it puts the UK at a disadvantage in comparison to Europe.

The Petroineos executive felt that it will ""hinder progress of delivering bio fuels at pace"".

Andrew Bowie, the parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said there had been a meeting with executives at Petroineos on November 23, last year to discuss options for the future of the site, long term fuel security for Scotland, and consideration of jobs at the site.

He said: ""Any potential decisions regarding future energy projects at the site are a private commercial matter.""

Workers at the refinery have slated the Scottish and UK governments over their failure to jointly develop proposals which could help protect hundreds of jobs at the complex.

A survey conducted by the Unite union involving hundreds of refinery workers, including contractors ""strongly indicates"" that the workforce believe there has been a ""collective failure"" to support them following the announcement by Petroineos to being the transition.

The survey found that 93% agreed that the potential impact of any potential closure on the local Grangemouth economy and that of surrounding communities would be 'severe'.

Some 88% said that politicians were not doing enough to support and protect jobs at Grangemouth; And only 11% expressed 'confidence' in finding a ""like for like"" job in the event of refinery operations ceasing at the Grangemouth site; Only three percent expressed confidence in the ongoing ""just transition"" plans for oil and gas workers.

The refinery produces a range of fuels including petrol, diesel, kerosene, LPG and jet fuel and currently employs around 500 and it is understood there are hundreds of contractor workers that support staff. Ineos employs another 450 staff on the site at Forties Pipeline Services and a further 1,000 in its petrochemicals business.

The 1,700-acre site is estimated to supply 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations as well Northern Ireland and the north of England.

It is the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports, and a major supplier of petrol and diesel ground fuels across the central belt.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""Petroineos management has been clear that this decision is a commercial one, and has been taken due to global factors.

""The commencement of preparatory work on a new import infrastructure at Finnart and Grangemouth will help futureproof the Grangemouth industrial cluster as part of its Just Transition to Net Zero.

""We are committed to working with industry to secure a sustainable future for Grangemouth that reflects our ambitions for decarbonisation and a just transition for Scotland's industrial sector and communities, whilst recognising the important role it plays in meeting fuel demand in Scotland.""

A UK Government spokesman added: ""We know this is a concerning time for workers and their families, and are working closely with Grangemouth refinery on the long-term future of the site and how they are supporting staff.

""The UK Government will always back the North Sea oil and gas sector and green industries, such as offshore wind and carbon capture and storage, to protect our energy security, attract investment and create opportunities for communities in Scotland and across the UK.""",heraldscotland.com,news,The Herald,,0.1843137254901961,448965988,1,https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/17894432/,

In Melbourne's early years of European settlement, the Yarra River supplied drinking water. It soon became known as the Yarra soup.

The search began for a supply of pure water in the 1840s, and engineer and architect James Blackburn chose Plenty River as the source. Ryder's Swamp, near the river north of Melbourne, became a reservoir - the largest artificial one in the world.

Blackburn, who was shipped to Tasmania as a convict but was later pardoned, did not live to see the project's completion, as he died of typhoid - a bacterial disease spread through contaminated food or water - in 1854.

The energy company benefits from petroleum prices that have stabilized at around $80 per barrel after OPEC+ members, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, earlier this month agreed to extend voluntary supply cuts into the second-quarter. Marathon Oil also guided to return at least 40% of its cash flow from operations to shareholders in this high-price market, which could yield a significant reduction in the company's outstanding shares. I believe that Marathon Oil is a very concentrated resource play for energy investors and the company's shares are attractively valued based off of earnings!

I rated shares of Marathon Oil a buy in December as I believed the OPEC+'s decision to implement voluntary supply restrictions at the time would boost petroleum prices and support share price gains for the energy company... which is exactly what happened. With a new round of supply cuts coming in Q2'24, I believe shares of Marathon Oil remain attractive as an income investment.

Marathon Oil is a concentrated resource play with major production in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Permian basins as well as in Oklahoma. Additionally, the company owns natural gas development assets in Equatorial Guinea. However, the E&P company is mainly focused on crude oil and grew its oil production 28% in FY 2023. Marathon achieved an average oil production of 190 MBOPD from its main sources of production and the company is set to remain a petroleum-focused energy company going forward.

The background for E&P companies generally, as well as Marathon Oil specifically, is favorable: the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2% in the fourth-quarter which fundamentally backed up energy prices. Currently, petroleum prices are hovering around the $80 per barrel mark (for the WTI sort) and the outlook is favorable as well. This is because OPEC+ members earlier this month extended voluntary crude oil supply cuts, amounting to 2.2M barrels of oil equivalent per day. Russia said that it will cut its production by an additional 471,000 barrels per day in the second quarter as well. These trends, a strong U.S. economy and extended supply cuts, are supportive of energy prices which in turn should allow Marathon Oil to return a ton of cash to its shareholders in 2024.

The high-price environment has allowed Marathon Oil to get top dollar for its petroleum products, which in turn has led to a surge in the company's free cash flow. In FY 2023, Marathon Oil generated $2.2B in (adjusted) free cash flow of which it returned $1.7B to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.

The majority of free cash flow returns typically happen in the form of stock buybacks (85% in FY 2023) and Marathon Oil returned a total of 78% of its free cash flow last year.

Marathon Oil chiefly focuses on stock buybacks, which gives the company flexibility in the timing of its capital actions. In the last three years, Marathon Oil generated free cash flow in the amount of $8.4B of which the E&P company returned $5.6B to shareholders (both stock buybacks and dividends). The free cash flow return percentage during these three years was not as impressive as the FY 2023 FCF return rate, but still very solid: 66%.

As long as petroleum prices stay around ~$80 per barrel, I expect Marathon Oil to continue to spend cash resources aggressively on the buyback of its own shares in FY 2024.

Marathon Oil repurchased 9% of its shares in FY 2023 and more buybacks are on the way in FY 2024. In the last three years, the E&P company bought back so many shares with its soaring free cash flow that it retired approximately 30% of its share count, causing a surge in its earnings per-share in return.

Marathon Oil's shares are attractively valued based off of earnings and have an attractive risk profile for investors as well, especially those that focus chiefly on free cash flow and cash returns. Marathon Oil is currently valued at a P/E ratio of 8.7X which implies an earnings yield of 11.5%.

The 3-year average P/E ratio was slightly lower, at 7.3X, but shares do have upside potential, in my opinion. The industry group P/E ratio is 8.9X with the industry group including E&P plays like EOG Resources (EOG), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and APA (APA). A 10X P/E ratio is not unreasonable to value Marathon Oil at, in my opinion, considering that the company is retiring a ton of its shares and generating a significant amount of free cash flow. This fair value P/E ratio implies at least 15% upside revaluation potential and a fair value of ~$32.

The biggest risk for Marathon Oil, as I see it, is a potential weakening in the economic setup which could lead to lower WTI petroleum prices which in turn could significantly dent the firm's potential for free cash flow growth. The company may also have to scale back its stock buybacks which has been a significant driver of EPS growth in recent years.

Marathon Oil is an E&P company with concentrated production assets in a small number of shale basins in the U.S. The economic backdrop is still quite favorable, in my opinion, which is why I am rating the exploration and production enterprise a buy. OPEC+ countries, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, this month extended their supply cuts into the second-quarter which implies favorable pricing tailwinds for petroleum markets. Since Marathon Oil is also a petroleum-focused E&P company, the firm stands to benefit from such supply limitations. Marathon Oil is set to generate higher free cash flow in this price environment and would likely spend even more cash on its buybacks!",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Asian Investor,0.5137254901960784,448964326,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1220194675/image_1220194675.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

Today is Sunday, March 24, the 84th day of 2024. There are 282 days left in the year.

Today's Highlight in History:

On March 24, 1989, the supertanker Exxon Valdez (vahl-DEEZ') ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and began leaking an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil.

On this date:

In 1765, Britain enacted the Quartering Act, requiring American colonists to provide temporary housing to British soldiers.

In 1832, a mob in Hiram, Ohio, attacked, tarred and feathered Mormon leaders Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon.

In 1882, German scientist Robert Koch announced in Berlin that he had discovered the bacillus responsible for tuberculosis.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill granting future independence to the Philippines.

In 1976, the president of Argentina, Isabel Peron, was deposed by her country's military.

In 1980, one of El Salvador's most respected Roman Catholic Church leaders, Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was shot to death by a sniper as he celebrated Mass in San Salvador.

In 1995, after 20 years, British soldiers stopped routine patrols in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

In 1999, NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, marking the first time in its 50-year existence that it had ever attacked a sovereign country.

In 2010, keeping a promise he'd made to anti-abortion Democratic lawmakers to assure passage of his historic health care legislation, President Barack Obama signed an executive order against using federal funds to pay for elective abortions covered by private insurance.

In 2013, hundreds of thousands marched in Paris protesting the imminent legalization of same-sex marriage. (It would be signed into law just over two months later).

In 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525, an Airbus A320, crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board; investigators said the jetliner was deliberately downed by the 27-year-old co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz.

In 2016, a U.N. war crimes court convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide and nine other charges for orchestrating a campaign of terror that left 100,000 people dead during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia; Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison. (The sentence was later increased to life in prison.)

In 2018, in the streets of the nation's capital and in cities across the country, hundreds of thousands of teenagers and their supporters rallied against gun violence, spurred by a call to action from student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

In 2020, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Summer Olympics in Tokyo would be postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus.

In 2021, Jessica Walter, whose roles included a scheming matriarch on TV's ""Arrested Development"" and a stalker in the film ""Play Misty for Me,"" died at 80.

It's an embedded part of many women's lives and beauty routines, especially in South East Asia. And now we're seeing a huge number of people on TikTok (where else?!) claiming that the best hair oil for growth is rosemary oil applied directly onto the scalp and that castor oil is the key to longer, thicker hair.

It's clear there is a market and an appetite for scalp oils (which are different from hair oils FYI), but what are the actual benefits of scalp oiling? Or the limitations? That's where we come in with the help of a top hairstylist and a hair transplant surgeon.

Scalps oils are a tricky subject because some people swear by them and others aren't so convinced. I've asked the experts to chime in with both the pros and the cons to deliver both sides, as it seems there is no straightforward answer here.

If you do love to oil your scalp and swear by its benefits then we've also got some of the best scalp oils out there to continue your routine. Just promise to read this before diving into the newness. Or, check out the best scalp treatments to solve other concerns.

Scalp oils can provide a temporary moisture boost (not to be mistaken for hydration, oils cannot hydrate the hair). This can lead to hair appearing shinier, stronger and less damaged. That's not to say that's not helpful. Many of us want our hair to appear in better condition, making oils beneficial but understand that they're likely improving the appearance, rather than the health of the scalp itself is key.

It can be a great self-care moment. It's important to remember that not everything in hair absolutely has to be for health and nothing else. If you find that applying an oil to your scalp once in a while makes you feel better and you don't feel like it's causing build-up (make sure you shampoo properly to avoid this) then go forth and oil-up.

Some hair types benefit more from oiling than other (though, studies still need to be conducted to determine this for certain). ""Afro hair types tend to be drier because the natural oils produced by the scalp have a harder time travelling down the hair shaft due to the curls and coils,"" says Samantha Cusick. In addition, oils can be used as a styling primer.

Fine, straighter hair has can benefit from more lightweight oils but need to be ""used sparingly to avoid greasiness,"" says Cusick and avoid weighing the hair down.

Sadly, there are limitations to hair oils. Dr Bessam Farjo, Hair Transplant Surgeon at Farjo Hair Institute notes that they can offer temporary condition benefits but ""the notion that they're indispensable for hair health is often overstated."" Since the scalp naturally produces its own oils, adding more unnecessarily can lead to excess grease and pore clogging, which he notes can ""exacerbate scalp issues like dandruff, acne and psoriasis.""

As much as we'd love to say they do, there is no proof that scalp oils help with hair growth. Dr Farjo notes that it primarily hinges on factors like genetics and overall health than using an oil. If you're concerned about hair loss, it's far better to speak to a professional to determine the root cause than try costly oils at home.

Cusick notes that regular oiling also requires proper removal, which can lead to over-shampooing and stripping the scalp of its natural oils.

It's also important to note that homemade scalp oils might do more harm to your scalp than those you can buy off the shelves. There are some fantastic oils out there that go through rigorous testing to ensure it won't cause damage to your scalp and hair. We strongly recommending opting for one of these as not only do they ensure safety, but they're also far more pleasant to use.

If you want the ritual of scalp oiling but feel like your scalp doesn't benefit from it, try a serum, which is water-based and can help promote a healthy scalp environment.

If you suffer from an itchy scalp from time to time, this serum-oil from Flora and Curl can provide some welcomed relief. This is a pre-shampoo treatment and is incredibly lightweight so gets to work without overdoing it on the greasy roots from. As promised, it provides instant relief. Though, if you're having on-going itching and discomfort, please seek help from a professional.

I've found in the past that dropper bottles aren't all that user-friendly, but this has a big pipette making it easy to apply to the scalp and handle even with oily fingers. This gets a big plus from me.

Another thing to note is that if you're sensitive to natural ingredients like essential oils then please do a patch test first as this could have the opposite effect, causing irritation instead of soothing it.

Bread Beauty Supply Hair Oil Everyday Gloss is a go-to for many and it's not hard to see why. It works as a great all-rounder, being excellent for a scalp slather pre-shampooing, a style extender between wash days and a high-shine treatment post-styling. With kakadu plum, safflower, castor, argan and sweet almond oil, it's a lightweight but jam-packed formula with many uses. It has a delish strawberry scent, too.

This one straddles between oil and serum brilliantly and it's really lovely to use. I find that it soothes the scalp nicely and is a great serum to use in between wash days if you find you get quite a dry scalp as it doesn't need to be washed out right away. Just make sure you're shampooing gently but thoroughly to remove excess product. It's housed in a beautiful rounded bottle that looks great on any cabinet!

I personally don't think there is enough evidence for it to be called a targeted hair loss serum so if you're experience hair loss, please visit a professional for advice, but it's a lovely serum nevertheless.

Fabel & Mane's brand ethos is rooted in the co-founder's grandmother's tradition of therapeutic hair oiling. The brand's Hair Oil is a fantastic all-rounder and this serum is a wonderful soother for the scalp. The formula is packed full of amla, aloe, bakuchi, vitamin E and plenty of plant extracts to help angry scalps.

This one is definitely a pre-wash oil so don't pop this on and then go about your day as normal, otherwise you risk your roots being much greasier than normal, particularly if you have fine hair.

I will say the brand's before and after photos are a little questionable though, so manage your expectations when it comes to results and giving it time.

The ultimate scalp soother but this is definitely more of a serum than an oil so I kind of cheated here. It's a great option if you're looking to spend a little more money and want something to help support the scalp without looking oily or greasy in the slightest. The formula contains the brand's TFC8® patented technology, which helps support the skin and scalp, in addition to amino acids, minerals, extracts, niacinamide and classic scalp supporting ingredients like glycerin and panthenol. The dropper bottle makes it easy to target apply to the scalp and the lightweight texture means it's easy to massage into the scalp.",marieclaire.co.uk,news,Marie Claire,,0.3098039215686275,448963891,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgEURNe6rGx88C95Lh3gJ8-1200-80.jpg,eng-9417586

But this has not been the case.

As he outlined his government's plan towards attaining the Vision 2030 goals, the Head of State resorted to a now familiar line, delivered whenever his pet projects have faced defeats in court.

His detractors, Dr Ruto suggested on Thursday, were bribe-takers who thrived in blackmail. The Head of State cut a frustrated figure, a far cry from the triumphant look he should have worn, having just signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.

On that very day, the High Court declined to temporarily halt the controversial 1.5 per cent pay deduction to fund Ruto's affordable housing plan - another victory for the president.

But recent experience has taught him not to rest easy until the Judiciary approves his policies. The new housing law, a product of the High Court's nullification of sections of the Finance Act 2023, is facing court challenges.

The president has not been as successful in court as he has in Parliament. Indeed, courtesy of his control over Parliament, the Affordable Housing Bill sailed easily through the bicameral House. As they had done previously, Ruto's troops subdued whatever opposition the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition party had mounted.

From the start, it was always clear that Ruto had a fine strategy to have his way in Parliament, which mostly involved wooing opposition lawmakers into his Kenya Kwanza Alliance.

Bolstered by his numerical advantage, he would say he wanted a ""strong opposition"" to check the government's excesses. And he was, seemingly, prepared for them, having observed their most preferred strategies.

In the face of Opposition demonstrations, Ruto unleashed a strong police reaction, faulted in some quarters for their heavy-handedness. In Parliament, he was assured of victory even in the most inconsequential of debates.

However, the president seems ill-prepared for the kind of opposition he faces, coming from all corners. On one end is the civil society, which has been eager to test the constitutionality of the president's policies.

Seasoned public-interest litigants, such as Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, and the Law Society of Kenya are also hitting hard, forcing the government back to the drawing board.

Besides the nullification of the housing levy that forced Ruto into establishing a new law, the courts also quashed his appointment of chief administrative secretaries (CASs). Parliament is processing a Bill that could see the president appoint an unlimited number of CASs, which could attract another legal battle.

The High Court also recently quashed the deployment of police officers to Haiti. Ruto's losses in court also include conservatory orders issued against his projects in several instances, such as the one suspending the implementation of the new Social Health Insurance Fund programme, which was lifted in January.

Nursing the court defeats, the president went on an attack against judicial officers, whom he accused of receiving bribes to frustrate his projects, claims he rephrased recently.

""The tragedy is that even those who go to challenge government policies in our courts... that after they have obtained stays and injunctions, whether it is housing or universal healthcare coverage plan, they have the audacity and temerity to come and look for government officials telling them that 'if you talk to us nicely, we are going to remove the injunction',"" Ruto said recently.

Omtatah, who has previously faced threats owing to his public-interest litigation work, wondered why the president was making such claims.

""I don't know what the president knows or means. Since it takes two to tango, I don't know who approached whom. What matters to me is that I have not filed my petition. So I cannot be a suspect. Let the president shut up and defend the cases against the Affordable Housing Act,"" said Omtatah.

Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna also faulted the president's remarks. ""He needs to provide evidence of this blackmail. He has threatened people who have filed cases before and now he is turning around to allege things without evidence,"" said Sifuna.

The previous public feud prompted a meeting with Chief Justice Martha Koome to reduce hostilities between their arms of government.

While Ruto may have construed the truce to mean the courts would play ball, as he suggested that the Executive and Judiciary had agreed on his housing plan, Koome has insisted that her arm of government would remain independent.

""The Judiciary is not, in any capacity, able to enter into any agreement with the Executive, especially in a matter that is before court,"" Koome said on Thursday.

The president should have known that he was bound to face hurdles in court, having served as deputy president in a government that was constantly sued for alleged constitutional breaches.

University don Herman Manyora notes that while sustained litigation comes as no surprise to Ruto, the president is grappling with the reality that people would openly challenge him.

""From the way he speaks, he seems surprised that people have the guts to do what they are doing - that they can dare challenge him,"" says Manyora, who urges the Head of State to ""do the right thing"".

""He should follow the Constitution and maintain fidelity to the rule of law. He should appreciate that the 2010 Constitution grants citizens certain rights. Equally important, he should negotiate with different groups because politics is all about negotiations,"" he adds.

Ruto is also facing dissent outside the courts. For instance, the clergy has come out strongly to oppose certain government policies, issuing stinging statements against the housing levy and the high cost of living.

In recent months, many have predicted the ""return of the Church"", referencing the vocal role it played in championing democracy and respect for human rights during the 1980s and 1990s.

The public, too, is rallying together to oppose unfavourable policies. Avocado farmers in Mt Kenya region have recently opposed new taxes, forcing their leaders into a tactical retreat. Now the government has been forced to relook at the contentious clauses of the Finance Act which require farmers to issue tax receipts and pay a 5 per cent tax.

Across the country, many more are voicing their dissent against the high cost of living and government wastage, some through Bunge la Mwananchi forums even as others heckle during presidential functions. Ruto's response has been to sustain engagements with the masses.

And Azimio is also maintaining the pressure on the government. When Ruto said he supported former PM Raila Odinga to chair the African Union Commission, the expectation by many was that the opposition would go easy on him as it had when Raila shook hands with former President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Indeed, Ruto and Raila are believed to be in a secret arrangement and have the National Dialogue Committee (Nadco) report tying their interests. But the opposition has not gone slow on the government, calling them out at every turn. On Friday, National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi questioned Ruto's commitment to bringing to book those involved in the unfolding fertiliser scandal.

Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who co-chaired Nadco alongside National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wah, recently warned of a return of anti-government protests if the cost of living stayed high.

Manyora believes that Ruto is feeling the heat of all these factors, hence his strong reaction. ""If (the late former President Daniel) Moi felt the heat, who is he not to? He cannot be stronger than Moi,"" he said.",standardmedia.co.ke,news,Standard Digital News - Kenya,Brian Otieno,-0.1450980392156863,448963625,1,https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/iA285JVh7DhC1ZR2STrn0LnhXRt2c8ootzktxolj.jpg,

According to a statement issued by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, the discussions between the two parties are part of ongoing active sessions with US officials to address several aspects of bilateral relations between Iraq and the US.

The meeting addressed the security situation in the region and how it affects the market, the economy, and energy pricing.

The US official spoke about the difficulties American oil companies face in the Kurdistan region of Iraq as a result of their inability to export their products.

Hussein highlighted the perspectives of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the federal government in Baghdad over the issue of oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan via the pipeline that connects northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.

According to authorities, Hari Das (45), Pradip Das (46), Jyotish Mallik (50), and Sanjit Nandi (53), all residents of MR Das Para in Tripura's Dhalai District, set out for a fishing trip in a boat at Dumboor Lake around 9:30 PM on Saturday.

As the storm intensified, the fishermen sought shelter in a tent positioned in the middle of the lake. However, strong winds caused the tent to submerge, resulting in the drowning of the four men. Search operations are underway to find the remaining three fishermen; one body has already been recovered.

Local reports say that the fishermen went to Dumboor after dinner, but when they didn't return, their families and worried locals went looking for them.

They found the overturned boat upon arrival and immediately alerted the police and Tripura State Rifles personnel, who promptly began a rescue operation.

Tripura Chief Minister Manik Saha expressed his condolences, stating, ""I am deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident of four fishermen missing in the storm at Dumboor reservoir. While one body has been recovered under the administration's supervision, efforts are ongoing to locate the remaining three.

There's Another Exciting Rumour That Will Pump You Up!,"For the past few months, there have been speculations about Samantha's appearance in Pushpa 2.

Pushpa 2: The Rule is one of the biggest releases of 2024. The Telugu action thriller stars Allu Arjun, Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Jagadeep Prathap Bandari, Jagapathi Babu, Prakash Raj and others. Directed by Sukumar, the first part, Pushpa: The Rise, was released in 2021 and became a huge blockbuster. The music was also a big hit, especially, Samantha's dance number, Oo Antava Oo Oo Antava.

For the past few months, there have been speculations about Samantha's appearance in Pushpa 2. Earlier, reports stated that the Kushi actress will not have a dance number in the sequel. Names like Sreeleela and Janhvi Kapoor popped up for the special dance sequence. However, a new update reveals that the actress might have a special appearance not only in Part 2 but also in Part 3.

As reported by 123Telugu, Pushpa 2 director, Sukumar wants Samantha to have a cameo in the sequel. The director wants the actress to do a small song at the end of the film. The character will also be extended in the third part, if required. To the uninitiated, Allu Arjun confirmed last month that they have plans to make Pushpa 3. If the reports are true, we might see the Citadel star in all three movies.

Meanwhile, during India Today Conclave 2024, Samantha talked about how she felt while filming the Oo Antava... song. The actress said that during the shoot, she was operating from a space of not being ""good enough"" or not being ""pretty"". During the first shot, the actress was shaking due to fear because being s*xy isn't her thing. As an actor, she has to put herself in the most uncomfortable and difficult circumstances. The actress added that doing a dance number again won't be challenging for her anymore.

Talking about Pushpa 2, recently, Rashmika Mandanna's pictures from the sets were leaked online. Reports stated that Allu Arjun was quite upset with the same and reprimanded the sets' security. The actress has not shared any reaction to the pics getting leaked.

Pushpa 2: The Rule will release in theatres on August 15, 2024.

But this has not been the case.

As he outlined his government's plan towards attaining the Vision 2030 goals, the Head of State resorted to a now familiar line, delivered whenever his pet projects have faced defeats in court.

His detractors, Dr Ruto suggested on Thursday, were bribe-takers who thrived in blackmail. The Head of State cut a frustrated figure, a far cry from the triumphant look he should have worn, having just signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.

On that very day, the High Court declined to temporarily halt the controversial 1.5 per cent pay deduction to fund Ruto's affordable housing plan - another victory for the president.

But recent experience has taught him not to rest easy until the Judiciary approves his policies. The new housing law, a product of the High Court's nullification of sections of the Finance Act 2023, is facing court challenges.

The president has not been as successful in court as he has in Parliament. Indeed, courtesy of his control over Parliament, the Affordable Housing Bill sailed easily through the bicameral House. As they had done previously, Ruto's troops subdued whatever opposition the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition party had mounted.

From the start, it was always clear that Ruto had a fine strategy to have his way in Parliament, which mostly involved wooing opposition lawmakers into his Kenya Kwanza Alliance.

Bolstered by his numerical advantage, he would say he wanted a ""strong opposition"" to check the government's excesses. And he was, seemingly, prepared for them, having observed their most preferred strategies.

In the face of Opposition demonstrations, Ruto unleashed a strong police reaction, faulted in some quarters for their heavy-handedness. In Parliament, he was assured of victory even in the most inconsequential of debates.

However, the president seems ill-prepared for the kind of opposition he faces, coming from all corners. On one end is the civil society, which has been eager to test the constitutionality of the president's policies.

Seasoned public-interest litigants, such as Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, and the Law Society of Kenya are also hitting hard, forcing the government back to the drawing board.

Besides the nullification of the housing levy that forced Ruto into establishing a new law, the courts also quashed his appointment of chief administrative secretaries (CASs). Parliament is processing a Bill that could see the president appoint an unlimited number of CASs, which could attract another legal battle.

The High Court also recently quashed the deployment of police officers to Haiti. Ruto's losses in court also include conservatory orders issued against his projects in several instances, such as the one suspending the implementation of the new Social Health Insurance Fund programme, which was lifted in January.

Nursing the court defeats, the president went on an attack against judicial officers, whom he accused of receiving bribes to frustrate his projects, claims he rephrased recently.

""The tragedy is that even those who go to challenge government policies in our courts... that after they have obtained stays and injunctions, whether it is housing or universal healthcare coverage plan, they have the audacity and temerity to come and look for government officials telling them that 'if you talk to us nicely, we are going to remove the injunction',"" Ruto said recently.

Omtatah, who has previously faced threats owing to his public-interest litigation work, wondered why the president was making such claims.

""I don't know what the president knows or means. Since it takes two to tango, I don't know who approached whom. What matters to me is that I have not filed my petition. So I cannot be a suspect. Let the president shut up and defend the cases against the Affordable Housing Act,"" said Omtatah.

Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna also faulted the president's remarks. ""He needs to provide evidence of this blackmail. He has threatened people who have filed cases before and now he is turning around to allege things without evidence,"" said Sifuna.

The previous public feud prompted a meeting with Chief Justice Martha Koome to reduce hostilities between their arms of government.

While Ruto may have construed the truce to mean the courts would play ball, as he suggested that the Executive and Judiciary had agreed on his housing plan, Koome has insisted that her arm of government would remain independent.

""The Judiciary is not, in any capacity, able to enter into any agreement with the Executive, especially in a matter that is before court,"" Koome said on Thursday.

The president should have known that he was bound to face hurdles in court, having served as deputy president in a government that was constantly sued for alleged constitutional breaches.

University don Herman Manyora notes that while sustained litigation comes as no surprise to Ruto, the president is grappling with the reality that people would openly challenge him.

""From the way he speaks, he seems surprised that people have the guts to do what they are doing - that they can dare challenge him,"" says Manyora, who urges the Head of State to ""do the right thing"".

""He should follow the Constitution and maintain fidelity to the rule of law. He should appreciate that the 2010 Constitution grants citizens certain rights. Equally important, he should negotiate with different groups because politics is all about negotiations,"" he adds.

Ruto is also facing dissent outside the courts. For instance, the clergy has come out strongly to oppose certain government policies, issuing stinging statements against the housing levy and the high cost of living.

In recent months, many have predicted the ""return of the Church"", referencing the vocal role it played in championing democracy and respect for human rights during the 1980s and 1990s.

The public, too, is rallying together to oppose unfavourable policies. Avocado farmers in Mt Kenya region have recently opposed new taxes, forcing their leaders into a tactical retreat. Now the government has been forced to relook at the contentious clauses of the Finance Act which require farmers to issue tax receipts and pay a 5 per cent tax.

Across the country, many more are voicing their dissent against the high cost of living and government wastage, some through Bunge la Mwananchi forums even as others heckle during presidential functions. Ruto's response has been to sustain engagements with the masses.

And Azimio is also maintaining the pressure on the government. When Ruto said he supported former PM Raila Odinga to chair the African Union Commission, the expectation by many was that the opposition would go easy on him as it had when Raila shook hands with former President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Indeed, Ruto and Raila are believed to be in a secret arrangement and have the National Dialogue Committee (Nadco) report tying their interests. But the opposition has not gone slow on the government, calling them out at every turn. On Friday, National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi questioned Ruto's commitment to bringing to book those involved in the unfolding fertiliser scandal.

Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who co-chaired Nadco alongside National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wah, recently warned of a return of anti-government protests if the cost of living stayed high.

Manyora believes that Ruto is feeling the heat of all these factors, hence his strong reaction. ""If (the late former President Daniel) Moi felt the heat, who is he not to? He cannot be stronger than Moi,"" he said.",standardmedia.co.ke,news,Standard Digital News - Kenya,Brian Otieno,-0.08235294117647063,448962735,1,https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/iA285JVh7DhC1ZR2STrn0LnhXRt2c8ootzktxolj.jpg,

Their work has succeeded in reducing the exhaust particles from the combustion of fuel, which has led to increasing interest in the contribution of particulates from lubrication oil. When discussing oil-related particulate emissions, hydrocarbon particles are customarily referred to. This thesis uses a broader definition, in which oil-related particulate emissions are modelled not only by the hydrocarbons, but also include the ash, carbons, and sulphate oil particulate emissions. The model developed in the project uses input data as oil consumption and oil ash content combined with tuning parameters, such as the oil ash transfer rate (ash emissions divided by oil consumption and oil ash content). Controlled engine tests have been performed to verify assumptions and fill knowledge gaps. The model can be applied to a variety of diesel engines, although the tuning factors might have to be reset. For example, introducing diesel particulate filters would dramatically reduce the oil ash emissions, since oil ash would accumulate in the filter. Oil consumption has played a central role in the present research. The modelling results indicate that special attention should be paid to oil consumption under running conditions with a low in-cylinder temperature, since the oil survival rate is high there. Under low-load and motoring conditions, hydrocarbons proved to be the main contributor to oil-related particulate emissions. At high engine load, oil ash emissions were the largest contributor to oil-related particulate emissions.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.06666666666666665,448962648,1,,

Senate Bill 1137 never went into effect. It is on hold until the vote in November.

Meghan Sahli-Wells, former mayor of Culver City and a board member of Elected Officials to Protect America, noted the referendum is funded by the fossil-fuel industry.

""Basically, they're asking to continue to poison California communities, when California communities have fought so hard for these protections,"" Sahli-Wells contended.

Oil and gas interests argued the changes could phase out thousands of wells as permits are not renewed and raise gas prices. However, a 2022 study from Harvard University found elderly people living near drilling or fracking wells are at higher risk of early death from diseases related to air pollution.

A ""Yes"" vote on the referendum would keep the restrictions in place. A ""no"" vote would repeal them.

Alex Walker-Griffin, mayor of Hercules, said poor air quality near oil and gas wells disproportionately affects neighborhoods of color.

""This is an issue that will plague low-income communities, places like Kern County,"" Walker-Griffin explained. ""Those households that are nearby, those are farmworkers, those are people who are already at a disadvantage.

MOSCOW, March 24. /TASS/. Gazprom supplies gas for Europe through Ukraine in the volume of 42.1 mln cubic meters per day via the Sudzha gas pumping station, a Gazprom representative told reporters, adding that the request for pumping through Sokhranovka had been rejected by the Ukrainian side.

""Gazprom supplies Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side via the Sudzha gas pumping station of 42.1 mln cubic meters as of March 24. The request for the Sokhranovka gas pumping station has been rejected,"" he said. Earlier the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) confirmed the request for pumping of this volume of gas.

On Saturday, March 23, the pumping equaled 42.4 mln cubic meters.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route to supply Russian gas to western and central European countries. The pumping through Nord Stream has been fully suspended.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine.

The identities of the kidnappers remain unknown as their faces had been covered during the attack on the mine but authorities believe this could be yet another case of extortion and that the colliers had been kidnapped to put pressure on the mine owner.

Upon receiving the distress call, Levies personnel, along with other law enforcement agencies, rushed to the scene and started their investigation into the matter.

Preliminary findings indicate that the kidnapped miners were employed at a mine belonging to Sardar Akbar Nasar. The motive behind the kidnappings and the whereabouts of the miners are yet to be determined, plunging their families and the community into anguish and uncertainty.

As the investigation unfolds, authorities are intensifying efforts to ensure the safe return of the abducted miners and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges facing the region and the vulnerability of those working in the mining sector. In the past, the militants have repeatedly kidnapped and attacked coal miners in Mach, Quetta, Bolan, Harnai and other parts of Balochistan.

This is not the first time that a mine or miners have been targeted.

In January 2021, 11 coal miners were killed after unidentified men kidnapped and later slaughtered them at the Mach coalfield of Bolan district, around 80km from Quetta in Balochistan. Four other miners were seriously injured.

According to officials, the miners shared a residential room near the coal mine where they worked.

""The dead bodies of the 11 miners have been taken to a local hospital,"" Khalid Durrani, a government official in the area, said.

The attack, before dawn, took place in the far-flung and mountainous Mach area while the miners slept, Durrani said.

Islamic State, also known as Da'ish, later claimed responsibility for the attack, through its Amaq news agency via its Telegram communications channel.

A security official said the attackers had separated the miners, tied their hands and feet, taken them out into the hills and later killed them.

All the victims belonged to the Hazara community of Quetta. The mine was situated deep in the mountains.",tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,,-0.1372549019607843,448962373,1,https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/coalminers1655216755-0/coalminers1655216755-0.jpg,

The models for predicting weld properties thus need a good evaluation of the distribution of the heat input from the arc to the workpiece. To have a predictive model of arc heat source it is necessary to take into account the cathode and its coupling with the plasma. The coupling allows to calculate the temperature and current density distributions along the cathode surface rather than prescribing them. This thesis focuses on the arc-cathode coupling for a plasma assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. A self-consistent coupling boundary model for high-intensity electric arc on a refractory cathode (thoriated tungsten) was developed accounting for the physics of the sub-layers of the cathode layer and the non-uniformity of the cathode surface physical state. The cathode layer model accounts for the non-equilibria in the cathode layer. It was tested in one-dimensional calculations and then extended to a cathode-plasma coupling boundary condition for gas tungsten arc implemented in OpenFOAM. Different modelling assumptions commonly used for developing the model were questioned and investigated. It was checked that the secondary electron emission is negligible compared to the effect of emitted electrons and ions. It was verified that it is justified to neglect the space charge of emitted electron when calculating the cathode surface electric field. It was verified that Richardson-Dushman electron emission law supplemented with Schottky correction is used within its domain of validity in GTA applications even for low work function emitters. It was shown that the radiative absorption of the cathode surface is not negligible compared to the radiative emission. The cathode layer model was also further developed to take into account the inhomogeneity of the cathode material. It was shown that the cathode inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the size of the arc attachment and consequently on the cathode surface and the plasma temperature. Good agreement was obtained with the measured cathode surface and plasma temperatures without imposing any adjustable parameters. The results showed that the proposed model, which is only based on physical principles, is able to predict the trends observed experimentally.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.09019607843137245,448961738,1,,

This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market. In the coming week, prices are expected to remain under pressure, reflecting these mixed influences.",fxempire.com,news,FXEmpire.com,James Hyerczyk,0.04313725490196085,448959929,1,https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/03/Natural-Gas-Industry-5.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700,eng-9421715

Riverine and particularly riparian ecosystems are among the most variable and important features of all landscapes. They connect landscape elements both longitudinally and laterally, and are governed by processes such as flooding, erosion and deposition that create dynamic, diverse and heterogeneous habitats. In fact, riparian zones are among the world's most species-rich habitats. Worldwide there are millions of dams that fragment stream and river systems, regulate flows and degrade ecosystems. Dams impact freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems and threaten biodiversity by disrupting organism movements and energy flows in the landscape. An important upstream effect of dams is inundation of habitats and development of new shorelines around impounded areas. Effects downstream of dams are mainly caused by changed hydrological regimes and retention of organic and inorganic materials in reservoirs, leading to reduced transport and dispersal of for example seeds to reaches downstream. The removal of dams create expectations that biota will eventually recover. We have studied a number of dam removal projects in Sweden. Our experimental results showed that following dam removal, newly exposed soils in former impoundments were rapidly colonized by pre-removal species. Their species richness increased slightly with time and their species composition indicated a slow change towards that in the reference site. In addition, the vegetation in formerly impounded areas showed a direction of change from lentic riparian plants (high proportion of aquatics) towards lotic ones, consisting of native perennials typical of free-flowing streams. We also found that the apprehensions that former impoundments would turn into pools of mud did not come true; in fact, a process towards more pristine channel morphology was observed. After removal there was erosion and downstream transport of sediment. We found only minor effects on macroinvertebrate communities. For example, a few species decreased over the years, suggesting that dam removal in itself might cause a temporary disturbance. This highlights the importance of long-term studies after dam removal, and also the importance of comparisons with pre-removal conditions and stretches unaffected by dams. Thorough documentation of executed dam removal projects and distribution of the results and experiences are tremendously important in the planning process of future decommissioning projects. Also, our experiences have taught us that in order to attain a successful dam removal it is important to involve stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations and local inhabitants in the process.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.0980392156862746,448959853,1,,

The National Bureau of Statistics has revealed that the average price for refiling a 5kg or 12.5kg Cylinder of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Cooking Gas) has increased again.

The bureau, in its latest price watch report, stated that for a 5kg cylinder, Nigerians paid N6,154.50 to refill in February 2024.

This represents a 19.75% increase when compared to the N5,139.25 average price that was recorded in the month of January 2024.

While on a year-on-year basis, NBS added that the 5kg refill price is 33.78% from N4,600.57 in February 2023.

While for a 12.5kg cylinder of cooking gas, Nigerians paid an average price of N15,060.38 to refill in February 2024.

The report further showed the states and regions with the highest and lowest prices average prices to refill 5kg and 12.5kg.

Reacting to the new price, Helen Duru, who lives around Igando area of Lagos, told Legit.ng that she has been struggling to cook.

""Most of the time, I wait for the power supply and quickly cook with my electric stove. Thank God I use a postpaid meter, so it is cheaper.

""What the government is doing to citizens is unfair. Why would they sit down and watch citizens suffer this much to buy food items and also to cook?""

Also, Mosurat Abiodun also called on the government to intervene because it is getting unbearable.

""Imagine spending up to N17,000 to refill my 12.5kg cooking gas, something I used to do for just N9,000 some months ago.

""I don't know why this is happening, but it's high time the government stepped in. That N17,000 is almost 40% of my monthly salary.""

Marketers give reasons for high cooking gas cost

Earlier, Legit.ng reported that cooking gas marketers under the Nigerian Association of Liquified Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) accused the Liquified Petroleum Gas terminal operators of causing the country's high cooking gas cost.

The Government's ambitious plan to fit heat pumps in homes across the UK in order to hit its net-zero goals is doomed to fail unless ministers quickly adapt their strategy, an industry insider has said.

Ministers say they want 600,000 heat pumps installed per year by 2028 - while just 18,900 were installed between May 2022 to December 2023. By 2035, ministers want to see up to 1.6 million heat pumps being fitted a year.

However, a recent report has found that up to five million homes across the UK may be unsuitable for heat pumps in another blow to the Government's plan.

In the report from the Heating and Hot Water Council, it found that nearly 4-5 million homes in the could be unsuitable for heat pump installations due to microbore piping.

It is estimated of the approximate 25 million homes in the UK, a fifth of those were built with microbore between the 1970s and 1990s meaning that a heat pump installation would be even more expensive with some units costing as much as £14,000 to fit, work less effectively and require a bigger unit.

Speaking on the issue, Johan du Plessis, the CEO and founder of Tepeo, told : ""Generally people assume that it is older builds that face compatibility issues with heat pumps.

""The reality is that microbore piping, generally used in more modern homes, presents severe challenges to heat pump installation. Yet again, this shows that we need a greater variety of low-carbon, domestic heating products on the market.

""While heat pumps are a great solution for many homes and are likely to be the answer for at least 60 per cent of the UK's housing stock, the government has treated them as a silver bullet for decarbonizing our homes. Consumers need choice, and the government's narrow support for heat pumps alone is failing to provide them with that.""

Microbore pipes are easy to install and are typically 6-12mm in diameter, but heat pumps work on much lower flow temperatures and need a constant flow of warm water which is restricted by the smaller diameter of microbore pipes, and therefore would need more energy to run.

Heat pumps are seen as a way of reducing the up to 18 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions, produced by traditional gas boilers, but the National Audit Office (NAO) has said the Government's assumptions about levels of consumer demand and manufacturer supply are ""optimistic"" with many people clueless as to what they are and their role.

At present, grants of up to £7,500 are available to make the switch to heat pumps under the flagship ""boiler upgrade scheme"" but due to the higher price of electricity compared with gas, people have been slow to switch to heat pumps.

The report from the NAO says the Government is around two years behind on its promise to rebalance the energy costs - for example by moving green and energy efficiency levies from electricity to gas, the NAO said.

Our analysis of official UK Government data on oil and gas spills found that 1,175 tonnes were spilled between January 2011 and December 2023 - 2,252 spills in total.

Some 308 tonnes of oil spilled into marine protected areas (MPAs) over the 13-year period. Green groups stressed that marine life is put at risk by spills, as well as toxic chemicals, microplastics, and seismic blasting noise pollution from oil and gas production.

Exposure to toxic oil fumes has been recognised to kill whales and dolphins years after exposure, according to the Centre for Biological Diversity.

Nearly all the spilled oil - 97 per cent - came from oil rigs, while the remainder was spilled from mobile rigs, pipelines and vessels.

The Ferret's investigation is part of a special series called Scotland's Seas in Danger, and it follows the UK Government's controversial plans to authorise hundreds of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea.

Environmental campaigners said our findings showed the scale of ""chronic oiling"" of the North Sea by the fossil fuel industry. Greenpeace said drilling for oil can ""devastate marine ecosystems"", yet the UK Government is ""greenlighting a new North Sea drilling frenzy - including in - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the climate crisis"".

In reply, the UK Government said it has an extensive framework of environmental protection measures in place to deal with spills. A trade body for the oil and gas industry said companies have ""comprehensive oil spill response plans in place to mitigate against potential incidents occurring and minimise the impact should they occur"".

The Ferret analysed the data on unplanned hydrocarbon releases at North Sea oil and gas facilities, which were reported to the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED).

Offshore oil and gas operators in UK waters must report all accidental releases of oil or chemicals to OPRED within six hours, regardless of the volume of the spill. They use the Petroleum Operations Notice 1 (PON1) reporting system.

The vast majority of incidents - 99 per cent - were below two tonnes and averaged two kilograms. Spilled liquids include crude oil, diesel, condensate, hydraulic oil, and lube oil. Most spills included oil and liquid gas - 125 tonnes worth.

Their causes include spills while filling bunkering vessels, overfilling vessels, holes and ruptures in pipelines, valve, seal and pump failures, equipment failure, and subsea releases.

There have been 25 incidents since 2011 where more than two tonnes were spilled, releasing 1,051 tonnes of oil.

In 2012, 605 tonnes of natural-gas condensate was spilled at the Elgin field platform, operated by TotalEnergies.

The second worst spill in Scottish Seas was in 2020 when 238 tonnes of diesel was spilled into the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt MPA.

There have been 215 spills into MPAs since 2011, totalling 308 tonnes of oil. Some 116 spills were reported in the Faroe-Shetland Sponge Belt and 93 in East of Gannet and Montrose Fields - a habitat for the ocean quahog clam, which is native to the North Sea and lives up to 400 years.

In 2011, two spills released 580kg of liquid gas into waters nine miles off the coast of Fraserburgh. The area was designated as the Southern Trench MPA in 2020 and is a breeding ground for the minke whale, a protected species.

BP, Shell and TotalEnergies operated the wells and vessels that spilled the most. They collectively accounted for 82 per cent of spills in terms of quantity and 42 per cent by number of spills.

The spills in the three most ""leaky"" fields - Elgin (operated by TotalEnergies), Foinaven (BP) and Gannet F (Shell) - were all in, or in close vicinity, of the MPAs. Of all spilled oil in the Scottish North Sea, 79 per cent came from one of these three fields.

Both the number of spills and the quantity of leaked substances have decreased over the years, with an average of 200 spills per year between 2011 and 2019, compared to 112 spills per year since 2020.

In January, the UK Government gave 17 oil companies the right to drill for fossil fuels in 24 new licence areas across the North Sea. These followed an initial tranche of 27 licences offered in October last year. The licences were granted in the Central North Sea, Northern North Sea and West of Shetland areas.

Firms could begin producing oil and gas before the end of the decade, the North Sea Transition Authority said.

According to the Scottish Government's 2020 Marine Assessment, even small oil spills can have an environmental impact if they happen in conservation areas.

Green groups condemn spills

Philip Evans, Campaigner at Greenpeace UK, claimed that The Ferret's findings ""proves many of the UK's marine reserves are paper parks protected in name only, where fossil fuel giants like Shell drill - and spill - to their hearts' content"".

He added: ""Drilling for oil at sea can devastate marine ecosystems, but the government is greenlighting a new North Sea drilling frenzy - including in - that will further imperil ocean life and worsen the climate crisis while doing nothing to lower our energy bills or boost our energy security.""

Naomi Tilly, campaign lead at Oceana UK, said: ""While catastrophic oil spills grab headlines - as they should - the less well-known 'chronic oiling' of UK seas has an insidious impact, creating an almost constant hazard for ocean wildlife.

""Sea birds are especially vulnerable, for instance, as the oil strips them of the ability to stay warm, dry and afloat. Even if they escape hypothermia or drowning, oiled feathers make flight more tiring, which on a migration can be the difference between life and death.""

She added: ""Of course it isn't just sea birds, whales and dolphins that ingest the toxic oil as they come up for air - shellfish accumulate the contamination in their bodies, the list goes on. Yet our government continues to allow oil and gas developments to be sited within our marine 'protected' areas. This utter disregard for some of the UK's most inspiring wildlife is not what the British people want or deserve.""

Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens MSP, said that the ""number, volume and location of these spills are extremely concerning"". He added: ""We've all seen the damage even a single spill can do. To have so many, especially in close proximity to designed to protect vulnerable species and habitats, should ring alarm bells.

""While oil companies rake in billions, they seem to be taking safety for granted, putting our seas, their fragile ecosystems, and the communities that rely on them at risk. Government and regulators must ensure the proper precautions are in place and followed, and act swiftly where they aren't.""

Caroline Rance, Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner, said: ""With a spill recorded every couple of days on average for the past decade it's clear this industry can't operate without causing serious harm.""

She added: ""The repeated damage to is totally unacceptable and these offenders must be taken to task to explain these incidents and put in place plans to stop it happening again in future. Oil will spill and gas will leak so any new oil and gas production will inevitably lead to further pollution of this type, in addition to the climate devastation it will bring.""

Mark Wilson, health, safety and environment operations director at Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said the oil industry ""recognises that there is no room for complacency when it comes to unintentional releases to sea"". He added: ""The industry takes all such releases seriously, regardless of size or potential for harm and are focused on driving continuous improvement.

""The reporting of unintentional releases of oil is conducted in an open and transparent manner no matter how small the release. For context, the UK annually produces about 40-45 million tonnes of oil and up to 40 billion cubic metres of gas. This equates to just under half the UK's demand for oil and gas.""

A spokesperson for the UK Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it monitors offshore pollution incidents ""closely"" and investigates all reports of accidental releases. ""If required, appropriate action will be taken, including the use of fines or referral for criminal prosecution,"" the spokesperson added. ""We have a comprehensive legal framework of environmental protection measures for offshore oil and gas activities, which covers all stages of the licensing and consenting process.""",theferret.scot,news,The Ferret,Billy Briggs,-0.08235294117647063,448959479,1,https://ez9mxwef6ut.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Marine-series-cover-series.jpg,eng-9413113

Coal, often considered the dirtiest fossil fuel, is experiencing a resurgence despite global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. More than two years after climate negotiators attempted to phase out coal, the industry is proving remarkably resilient, fueled by a mix of factors including China's energy insecurity, rising Indian demand, the fallout from the Ukraine war, and challenges in international programmes to reduce fossil fuel reliance.

China's energy insecurity has pushed Beijing to rely more on trusted power sources, including coal, leading to a record-high output last year. Prices, while lower than the 2022 peak after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, remain high, with benchmark Newcastle coal futures trading at around $130 a tonne.

Asia, particularly China and India, will play a significant role in the coal resurgence, accounting for more than 70% of global coal consumption by 2026. These countries, along with Indonesia, are operating new coal power plants and have proposed additional ones, according to Global Energy Monitor.

Rob Bishop, CEO of Australian miner New Hope Corp, highlighted the continued demand for coal in Asia, indicating that coal will remain a significant energy source for the foreseeable future.

This extended reliance on coal is a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against swiftly shifting away from carbon-intensive power, citing benefits in terms of reliability and cost. However, this trend is concerning for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

Despite expectations of coal production plateauing, recent events like power shortages in China and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have bolstered coal demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects coal output to stabilise through 2026, aligning with industry forecasts of a gradual decline.

In China, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates as low-cost reserves have been tapped, leading to the need for deeper and more expensive mines. However, the growth of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, is expected to exceed the growth in electricity consumption, providing a lifeline for coal as a reliable baseload option.

India is forecast to see growth in coal output this year, surpassing 1 billion metric tonnes for the first time, as the country aims to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports.

Indonesia, the top thermal coal exporter, expects stable production for the next two years, driven by domestic demand from the nickel processing sector. However, accelerating the end of coal remains challenging in economies with newer plants, rising energy demand, and a need to create jobs.

Advancements in solar, wind, batteries, and energy storage systems are making renewable energy more affordable and could transform the energy mix in the future. However, the transition away from coal is expected to be gradual, testing previous expectations of a rapid decline in coal usage.

While coal's days are numbered, the world will need operators to mine coal and support the transition to renewable energy over many decades.

Senate Bill 1137 never went into effect. It is on hold until the vote in November.

Meghan Sahli-Wells, former mayor of Culver City and a board member of Elected Officials to Protect America, noted the referendum is funded by the fossil-fuel industry.

""Basically, they're asking to continue to poison California communities, when California communities have fought so hard for these protections,"" Sahli-Wells contended.

Oil and gas interests argued the changes could phase out thousands of wells as permits are not renewed and raise gas prices. However, a 2022 study from Harvard University found elderly people living near drilling or fracking wells are at higher risk of early death from diseases related to air pollution.

A ""Yes"" vote on the referendum would keep the restrictions in place. A ""no"" vote would repeal them.

Alex Walker-Griffin, mayor of Hercules, said poor air quality near oil and gas wells disproportionately affects neighborhoods of color.

""This is an issue that will plague low-income communities, places like Kern County,"" Walker-Griffin explained. ""Those households that are nearby, those are farmworkers, those are people who are already at a disadvantage.

Reminding that Turkey's energy needs are growing, Bayraktar said, ""We predict that the demand in Turkey will continue to increase in the coming period until the 2040s. Our per capita electricity consumption is approximately 4 thousand kilowatt hours. Therefore, our demand is increasing. ""We are also trying to reduce our dependence on foreign sources."" he said.

Strategies in Equation

Bayraktar noted that they have put forward some strategies, especially renewable energy, in this equation and said, ""Turkey must definitely include its domestic and renewable resources, including our domestic coal. Our second important priority is energy efficiency. In other words, while Turkey continues to increase its demand by importing so much energy, it must use its energy efficiently."" said.

Energy Transformation

Emphasizing that another factor here is energy transformation, Bayraktar said, ""As the trend towards greener resources continues, we know that oil and natural gas will definitely continue to have a place in economies in the coming decades. Therefore, since these will not be reset in one day, Turkey must find its own oil and natural gas."" he said.

Searches Will Be Accelerated

In this context, Bayraktar said that they made the largest natural gas discovery in the history of the Republic in the Black Sea in August 2020 and said, ""Some of the gas currently used in our homes is produced as our own gas in the Black Sea. This is of course just the beginning. As of today, we have reached a production figure of 3,7 million cubic meters. ""In 2024, we will accelerate exploration in three locations, especially in the Black Sea."" said.

Best Quality Oil

We are talking about the pump track that Alhaurín de la Torre has had since 2020, in the El Algarrobal area. It is a space designed for cyclists - specifically for BMX bikes - which is also enjoyed by people who use skateboards or scooters.

The pump track takes advantage of a unique design and layout and allows riders to use it almost without needing to pedal. It is one of the largest in Andalucía, as announced at the time by Alhaurín de la Torre town hall.

The work on the site, which is open from Monday to Sunday from 8am to 10.30pm, was completed in the year the coronavirus pandemic broke out and so its opening had to be delayed. Today, it is a place where young and old, groups of friends or families gather to engage in outdoor sport.

The circuit, made of asphalt, is marked with yellow and blue lines and has curves and slopes which serve to enhance the jumps and the skill of the cyclists; in fact, it is the skill of each cyclist or skater that will allow them to complete the entire route without hardly propelling themselves. The track is also divided into two parts, depending on its difficulty: one for children and the other for adults or more experienced users.

And another thing of interest for many families: next to the pump track, there is a sports court with goals and mini-basketball hoops, also free of charge, so that the day's sports and leisure activities can revolve around sport on two feet or two wheels. In addition, to round off the morning, very close to the area, on Avenida Isaac Peral and its surroundings, there are several bars and restaurants where you can enjoy some tapas at good prices.",surinenglish.com,news,surinenglish.com,,0.1764705882352942,448958615,1,https://s3.ppllstatics.com/surinenglish/www/multimedia/2024/03/06/pista-ciclista-alhaurin-torre%20(1)-kgk--1200x840@Diario%20Sur.jpg,

To compete with gasoline as a fuel, thebiofuels need to be economically feasible and demonstrated on a large-scale. Biogas and ethanolhave a great potential as commercial biofuels, even though it has difficulties, for example, highcapitalinvestment, absence of demonstrated innovations, and availability of raw materials and soforth. This thesis focuses on different application-driven bioprocess developments for improvingthe techno-economic feasibility of the biogas and ethanol industries.The biogas industry was studied from three different perspectives:1) Modeling approach in which a Process Simulation Model (PSM) model was developed forpredicting the biogas productions, as exploiting new substrates is vital for a biogas industrygrowth. The PSM model was created using Aspen Plus® which includes 46 reactions of differentphases in the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) processes. It also contains certain important processparameters, thermodynamics, rate-kinetics, and inhibitions involved in the AD processes. PSMwas a library model for the AD processes, which was validated against the laboratory andindustrial data. The validation showed that the PSM predicted the biogas production about 5% inexcess, which could ease the biogas industry to predict biogas from new substrates.2) Simulation approach to study the imperative components affecting the profitability of theplant. For this purpose, a local municipality plant was studied under distinct situations. The choiceof upgrading method, capacity, cost of waste and its processing, number of digesters used, etc.were exploited. The results showed that the collection and transportation fee, landfilling fee, andthe reduced operation of a plant were the main considerations in influencing its profitability.Moreover, it was identified that for bigger cities the decentralization strategy could beat theexpense of collection and transportation of waste, and the plant could obtain a 17.8% return oninvestment.3) Rethinking digester technology in which the cost of the digester was significantly lessenedusing a cutting-edge textile, which was principally intended for developing countries. The digestercost played an important role in consuming biogas for different applications. The textile digesterwas tested on a laboratory scale, followed by field tests in different countries including India,Indonesia, and Brazil. Textile digesters cost one-tenth of the conventional digesters, and thepayback was more or less between 1-3 years, when replacing the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)and kerosene as a cooking fuel for households.When it comes to ethanol, the first generation ethanol production using grains was financiallypossible with a payback of about 13 years. Nonetheless, with the fluctuation of the oil prices, theethanol industries need to look for alternative sources of revenues. Different retrofits wereconsidered, including the effect of thin-stillage/whole-stillage to ethanol and biomass, in additionto the integration of the first and second generation ethanol production. The results revealed that4% additional ethanol could be obtained when the thin-stillage was converted into ethanol andfungal biomass, while the payback was reduced to 11.5 years. The integration of the first andsecond generation ethanol production revealed that it has a positive influence on the overalleconomics of the process with a payback of 10.5 years. This could help the ethanol industries toconsider a revamp for a better environmental, economic, and energy efficient process.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.08235294117647052,448958606,1,,

Bayraktar stated that Turkey needs to produce more value-added products and reduce its foreign dependency in energy in order to solve the current account deficit problem and said, ""We are working with the aim of absolutely ending foreign dependency in the field of energy and natural resources in the next 30 years in the Turkey Century."" said.

The Need Is Increasing

Reminding that Turkey's energy needs are growing, Bayraktar said, ""We predict that the demand in Turkey will continue to increase in the coming period until the 2040s. Our per capita electricity consumption is approximately 4 thousand kilowatt hours. Therefore, our demand is increasing. ""We are also trying to reduce our dependence on foreign sources."" he said.

Strategies in Equation

Bayraktar noted that they have put forward some strategies, especially renewable energy, in this equation and said, ""Turkey must definitely include its domestic and renewable resources, including our domestic coal. Our second important priority is energy efficiency. In other words, while Turkey continues to increase its demand by importing so much energy, it must use its energy efficiently."" said.

Energy Transformation

Emphasizing that another factor here is energy transformation, Bayraktar said, ""As the trend towards greener resources continues, we know that oil and natural gas will definitely continue to have a place in economies in the coming decades. Therefore, since these will not be reset in one day, Turkey must find its own oil and natural gas."" he said.

Searches Will Be Accelerated

In this context, Bayraktar said that they made the largest natural gas discovery in the history of the Republic in the Black Sea in August 2020 and said, ""Some of the gas currently used in our homes is produced as our own gas in the Black Sea. This is of course just the beginning. As of today, we have reached a production figure of 3,7 million cubic meters. ""In 2024, we will accelerate exploration in three locations, especially in the Black Sea."" said.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The conflict in Eastern Europe also kept oil prices from moving lower. Russia launched the largest missile and drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure of the war to date on Friday, hitting the country's largest dam and causing blackouts in several regions, Kyiv said. However, chatter has emerged within the market that Russia would further discount its barrels in light of the escalation, analysts said.

A steeper discount could make Russian crude more attractive to international buyers. Meanwhile, the US dollar was set for a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's surprise interest rate cut on Thursday bolstered global risk sentiment.

Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices edged up this week to a six-week high amid supply concerns and following some spot demand pickup from buyers.

When environmentalists talk about climate change, it's typically in stark terms, describing it as a crisis that threatens the future of the planet. A scrappy group of filmmakers and activists think it can also be funny.

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humour to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

In recent years, research has shown that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from distribution infrastructure and other sources. A 2022 Harvard study also found that natural gas used in homes contains hazardous pollutants.

Called ""Hot & Toxic,"" the campaign's trailer is a riff on a reality television show in which 21 irritating housemates symbolising pollutants associated with natural gas descend on an unsuspecting homeowner. The message is clear: Using natural gas inside your home is not safe.

The absorption maxima (λ) of HAuCl were observed at 218 and 291 nm, which were assigned to the ligand-metal absorption owing to the charge transfer energies. The λ for sodium alginate was observed at 266 and 349 nm. The reduction of HAuCl using sodium alginate as a reducing and stabilizing agent was confirmed principally by surface plasmon excitation causing the color shift from yellow to pink in the solution, which was the most substantial and apparent sign of the formation of GANPs. The surface plasmon vibration bands of nanoparticles (noble metals, particularly gold and silver) are much stronger than any other metals. The absorption spectrum showed the λ at 546 nm which was associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that confirmed the successful reduction of Au into Au by the sodium alginate substrate. The shift of the λ absorption band to a lower wavelength, as compared to the starting material, confirmed the reduction of the GANPs. These results unequivocally indicated the effectiveness of the sodium alginate as a reducing, capping, and stabilizing agent wherein the product λ absorption band was observed at 546 nm as the newly appearing peak, while the presence of the λ absorption peak at 266 nm indicated the alginate presence, thereby confirming the alginate moieties presence on the gold nanoparticles in the nanopreparation. These findings also aligned with the previous report.

FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to analyze the functional groups' presence in the GANP, HAuCl, and sodium alginate. The comparisons of IR absorption bands of the starting materials and the prepared nano-product confirmed the formation of the intended nanopreparation (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Sodium alginate showed absorption peaks at 3451, 2128, 1665, 1426, 1060, and 819 cm. The absorption peak at 3451 cm was assigned to the free hydroxyl groups, while the peaks at 1665 cm were allotted to the carbonyl functionality. For the HAuCl, several absorption peaks at 3456, 2092, 1643, 1393, 1123, and 814 cm were observed. The spectrum of GANPs showed four different peaks at near similar wavelengths in comparison with the sodium alginate and HAuCl. The four peaks of the GANP were observed at 3470, 2086, 1648, and 720 cm, respectively. The peak at 3470 cm, was assigned to the O-H stretching vibration, while peaks at 2086 cm and 1648 cm corresponded to the asymmetric stretchings of C=C and C=O groups. The peak at 720 cm was referred to as the alkane functionalities of the GANP. The O-H groups peak shift from 3456 to 3470 cm, indicating the interactions between the alginate moiety and the HAuCl starting materials wherein the redox between the alginate and the gold substrate exchanged electrons to reduce the Au ions to Au through the reduction process.

Figure 5 represents the SEM magnified pictures of the starting materials and the final product. The surface morphology of the GANPs (magnification 150,000×) confirmed the formation of nanoparticles, which are present in the GANP. It showed no aggregation and smooth surface of the nanoparticles (Fig. 5A). Figure 4B,C showed the magnified pictures of the raw materials, HAuCl, and sodium alginate. The sodium alginate showed a highly porous and rough surface, that was feasibly conjugated with the forming AuNPs during the process of preparation of the nano-product in the aqueous environment, thereby also providing it coating/capping and stabilization. The SEM analysis of the HAuCl (120,000) showed comparatively bigger sizes, and irregular shapes with a mean particle size of 70 nm which was expected due to the HAuCl clusters and its spherical morphology (Fig. 5B). The alginate analysis is shown in Fig. 4C. The histogram analyses showed a mean size of 23.66 nm of the prepared nanoparticles. The findings are consistent with previous report.

The EDX analysis showed the elemental peaks of the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), and calcium (Ca) atoms at the energy value of 5 keV for the sodium alginate. The elemental peaks of chlorine (Cl), potassium (K), and gold (Au) were also observed at the 5 keV energy values in the EDX spectra of the HAuCl. The E-mapping analysis of the GANP confirmed the presence of Au, Na, O, and C in the sample of prepared final nanomaterial which demonstrated the characteristic peak of Au with a weight percentage of 19.55, while the percentages of O and C were 45.4 and 33.8, respectively. The C is sourced from the alginate moieties that are present in the nanoparticles of the prepared nanomaterial. These findings are consistent with the previous report (Fig. 6).

The XRD of GANPs (Fig. 7) at 2Ө orientation showed six peaks at 28.68°, 38.18°, 44.39°, 64.57°, 77.54°, and 81.72°. These peaks corresponded to the (110), (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes, respectively, when compared with the Joint Committee on Powder Standards (JCPDS), File no. 04-0784 and 01-074-0895. These peaks confirmed the crystalline nature of the GANPs and provided confirmatory proof that the material can be indexed as a face-centered-cubic structure. Out of the related plane, the (111) plane showed a higher intensity than other planes, demonstrating that the (111) plane is the typical orientation. In case of HAuCl, six peaks, 15.36°, 28.113°, 40.366°, 50.317°, 58.316°, and 66.148° were detected at angle 2Ө which corresponded to planes (200), (- 112), (021), (- 421), (- 711), and (- 803), respectively, as compared with the JCPDS, File no. 01-073-1234. The XRD of sodium alginate at 2Ө observed two peaks at 19.84° and 28.68° due to the reflection of their (001) plane from the amorphous halo and (110) plane from the polyguluronate unit, the findings are consistent with the previous report. The lattice size (D) of GANPs was also collected using Scherer's equation which predicted the average size of the nanoparticles of the prepared nanomaterial GANPs at about 37.53 nm.

Isolation and identification of anaerobic bacteria from acne

The study included 70 patients with acne vulgaris. The male patients' percentage was 69% while females constituted 31% (Fig. 8A). This is because men delay treatment, and are more exposed to the factors of the outside environment, such as exposure to the sun, high temperature, air pollution, halogenated hydrocarbons use, inhaled and passive exposures, as well as exposures to mineral oils, all that serve as risk factors for acne. Also, in personal hygiene-related habits wherein facial cleansers for the skin are consistently used, certain studies have indicated a significant relationship between the severity of acne and personal hygiene. Acne can be affected by factors, e.g., family history, the nature of the skin, oily and mixed skin, obesity, sweetened food, smoking, poor quality of sleep, and stress. Also, the usage of skincare products, especially in females, the acne incidence was statistically higher in females at 74.5%. Figure 8B summarizes the distribution of acne, gender, and regions of acne together with acne-sourced bacterial strains between the genders. Herein, the males showed the highest infection by Clostridium innocuum, which may be because of smoking, fast food, and hygienic causes, as it is among the most common bacterial infections that could translocate from body part to the skin and tissues and cause serious effects. The age of acne patients was between 15 and 30 years, which could be due to the enlargement of keratinocytes and sebaceous glands over-activity resulting in excessive production of oily sebum causing acne. Moreover, other factors, such as school-age stress also result in the prevalence of acne. Finally, the results indicated that different acne sampling sites have different types and numbers of acne-sourced bacterial strains. It was observed that among the face sampling sites, the cheek and jaws were mostly containing the anaerobic bacterial types. Any alteration of the skin bacteria composition changes the functions of skin microbiota and affects the development and occurrence of skin disease. It is important to mention that most of these functions are associated with the metabolism of essential chemicals, such as lipids, cofactors, vitamins, and amino acids. The alteration in these compounds may also significantly disturb the host skin homeostasis through stimulation of the immune cells and keratinocytes of the skin (Fig. 8C). The heat map showed the distribution of these bacteria on different face regions, and from these clinical specimens of bacteria, 24 were C. innocuum, 21 were Lactobacillus plantarum, 13 were Anaerococcus prevotii, and 12 were Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus that were isolated to investigate the antibacterial activity potential of GANPs.

Antibacterial activity

The antibacterial activity of GANPs at various concentrations (6.4, 3.2, 1.6, and 0.8 mg/ml), revealed the inhibitory effects of the nanopreparation against C. innocuum, L. plantarum, P. asaccharolyticus, and A. prevotii (Fig. 9). The bacteria with the highest inhibitory diameter in the agar well-diffusion tests were A. prevotii, with an average inhibition zone diameter of 21.88 mm at 6.4 mg/ml concentration, followed by L. plantarum with an average inhibition zone diameter of 21.68 mm, and P. asaccharolyticus with an average inhibition zone diameter of 20.43 mm, respectively. The bacteria with the lowest inhibitory diameter in this study was C. innocuum which showed an average inhibition zone diameter of 19.37 mm at 6.4 mg/ml, owing to their ability to produce toxin-forming spore-forming that made it more resistant to most of the antibiotics. The Gram-positive bacteria were more resistant to the antimicrobial mechanisms of nanoparticles. The thickness of the peptidoglycan layer found in Gram-positive bacteria cell walls was thought to be responsible for this resistance. The GANPs are regarded as antimicrobial agents able to generate a clearance zone for antimicrobial activity due to its nano-sized components and better penetration ability. The GANPs can bind to the cell membrane, disrupt the permeability of the outer cell membrane to penetrate the inner layer of the cell membrane, and block the respiratory chain dehydrogenase, together with disassociating the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby also disabling the proton channel force through the cytoplasmic membrane. By reducing the size of the nanoparticles, the interaction between the nanoparticles and the bacterial cell may result in increased release of the cored gold particles to improve the antibacterial properties. The electrostatic attraction between the bacterial cell membrane and the GANPs may also lead to an increased accumulation of gold on the bacterial cell membrane, which can lead to high stress on the bacterial membrane and the further penetration of GANPs into the cytoplasm, eventually leading to cell lysis. The current findings agreed with Li et al. who demonstrated that the AuNPs owing to their favorable surface chemistry, may be utilized as an antibacterial agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

The MIC of GANP at various concentrations was tested with 6.4 mg/ml to 12.5 µg/ml against C. innocuum, L. plantarum, P.s asaccharolyticus, and A. prevotii. The influence of GANPs on the growths of bacterial isolates from acne was determined colorimetrically using resazurin. The GANPs showed excellent potential against these pathogenic bacteria. From 6.4 mg/ml to the concentrations of 400 µg/ml, complete killing of the bacteria in the wells was recorded in the wells. The MIC of GANP for P. asaccharolyticus and A. prevotii at a concentration of 200 µg/ml showed a color change to pink due to the activity of bacteria, while the MIC for C. innocuum and L. plantarum was at 400 µg/ml. These results showed that P. asaccharolyticus and A. prevotii were more sensitive to GANP (Fig. 10). Seemingly, following the previous report, the GANP also exhibited antibacterial effects in two ways, first, they restricted the membrane potential, and interacted with the mitochondria to inhibit the ATPase and then reduce the ATP levels, indicating a general decline in metabolism. Second, affects bacterial DNA by preventing ribosomal subunits from attaching to tRNA. The GANP improved the chemotaxis in the early phases of the biochemical reactions. The mechanism of action of gold nanoparticles didn't include pathways associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes cell death by bactericidal antibiotics. The results from this study demonstrated the GANP's significant anti-bacterial activity at lower concentrations against anaerobic bacteria sourced from the acne.

The anti-biofilm activity of GANPs at various concentrations (100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, and 700 µg/ml) against C. innocuum, L. plantarum, P. asaccharolyticus, and A. prevotii were evaluated utilizing a microtiter plate staining procedure with crystal violet and measurements by a microplate absorbance reader at 590 nm. The addition of GANPs inhibited the formation of biofilm of most of the acne-sourced bacterial strains, as indicated by a decrease in the optical density values with the rising concentrations of the nanopreparation (Fig. 11), The GANPs exhibited significant changes in all the bacterial strains from the highest up the concentration of 700 µg/ml to the lowest, except for A. prevotii which showed activity at 100 µg/ml, which did not prevent the formation of biofilm. Two different concepts have been proposed to explain these effects, the GANPs may weaken the biofilm formation in bacteria by moving into the bacterial cell wall and interfering with the enzymes and proteins required for microbial adhesion, which results in decreased biofilm formation. The GANPs inhibits biofilm formation by inhibiting the formation of exogenous polysaccharides. The NPs inhibit the biofilm formation by penetrating the water channels /aqua pores that transport water and nutrients through the layers of polysaccharides present in the bacterial cell walls. The ongoing results have demonstrated the impact of GANPs on the formation of bacterial biofilms and significant variations were noted with the change in the bacterial species, types of nanoparticles, nanoparticles' size, and nanoparticle concentrations. These results agreed with Al-shukri et al. findings which demonstrated that AuNPs at high concentrations (75, 100, and 200 µg/ml) influenced the formation of biofilms as compared to the low concentrations of the AuNPs.

The anti-adhesion activity of GANPs at various concentrations (100, 200, 600, and 700 µg/ml) against C. innocuum, L. plantarum, P. asaccharolyticus, and A. prevotii were evaluated utilizing a microtiter plate staining procedure with crystal violet and measurements by a microplate absorbance reader absorbance investigation at 630 nm (Fig. 12). The addition of GANPs inhibited the initial adherence of acne-sourced bacterial strains to polystyrene microplate, as indicated by a decrease in the optical density (O.D.) values with the rising concentration of the GANP nanoformulation. The role of GANPs as an antimicrobial agents involved two steps upon incubation with bacterial cells. First, the aggregation of GANPs under bacterial cells followed by interaction with the surface after reaching it, causes an increase in cell wall tension. Secondly, after penetration, the nanomaterial-based nanoparticles migrate into the interior of the biofilm and bacterial cell components causing nano-toxicity leading to metabolic imbalance followed by bacterial cell death. The GANPs penetration depends on several factors, such as the structure of the biofilm surface, chemical composition, biofilm maturity, size of the nanoparticles, surface charge, and nanoparticle concentration. The antimicrobial potentials of GANP were dependent upon the perturbations that occurred in different bacterial components and the biofilm. All biofilm penetration methods involved hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waals attraction-based interactions. The current results were in agreement with previous result wherein it was exhibited that the AuNPs capping by Arabic Gum exhibited a noteworthy anti-adhesion activity against Cutibacterim acne.

Effect of GANPs on human blood components

The human blood components were treated with 1 mg/ml of GANPs and exhibited no significant effects as compared with the control (Table 2). The hemolysis percentage of the RBCs was at 1.27% which was the acceptable level of less than 5% standard, under limited hemolysis. Following the criterion in the ASTM E2524-08 standard (test procedure for analyzing the hemolytic properties of nanoparticles), greater than 5% hemolysis suggests that the test nanoparticle damaged the RBCs. A quantitative analysis of the released hemoglobin also indicated potential damage of RBCs after administration, which is a good predictor of carrier's in vivo toxicity. These results indicated that the GANPs can be used as a biocompatible and non-toxic agent and an efficient antibacterial agent with the potential to ameliorate the problems associated with development of the multi-drug-resistant bacteria. These findings agreed with the reports from Nimi et al. who showed that there is no aggregation of blood cells (WBCs, RBCs, and Platelets) after incubation with AuNPs at the given concentration of 1 mg, were in the hemolysis induced by the AuNPs at 0.1%.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2313725490196079,448957662,1,https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-57643-5/MediaObjects/41598_2024_57643_Fig1_HTML.png,

United States Central Command (CENTCOM) updated on incidents in the Red Sea area over the past day, reporting on a Houthi attack against a Chinese oil tanker.

According to the statement, the Iranian-backed Houthis fired four anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) into the Red Sea ""in the vicinity"" of the Chinese-owned and operated Panamanian-flagged M/V Huang Pu.

About 12 hours later, a fifth ASBM was fired toward the M/V Huang Pu and the ship issued a distress call but did not request assistance. According to the CENTCOM statement, the Chinese oil tanker suffered minimal damage and no casualties were reported, though there was a fire on board but it was extinguished within 30 minutes.

""The Houthis attacked the MV Huang despite previously stating they would not attack Chinese vessels,"" CENTCOM pointed out, referring out what were previously reports of the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist group promising Moscow and Beijing that their vessels would not be harmed and even ratifying the agreement in Oman.

In addition, CENTCOM said U.S. forces, including USS Carney, preemptively engaged six Houthi unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the southern Red Sea area and five crashed into the sea, while the last ""inland into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.""

James Stewart wrote in The Sunday Times: ""Transform your springtime stomps by taking the path less travelled and choosing a new route from the 173,000 acres of UK woodland, which are, in fact, vestiges of temperate rainforest.

""As well as being hotspots for thriving biodiversity, they are enchanting places to visit where you'll stumble across secret gorges and spot rare birdlife.

""Here are the ones worth pulling on your wellies for -- with lovely places to put your feet up afterwards.""

""The RSPB has taken Naddle Farm in the east Lake District under its wing to protect a tract of ancient forest where walkers can come to spot pied flycatchers, ring ouzels, peregrine falcons and merlins,"" Stewart said.

He continued: ""The reserve also includes a mosaic of upland habitats -- where you can spot fell ponies grazing -- and Haweswater Reservoir itself.""

A scrappy group of filmmakers and activists think it can also be funny.

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humor to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

In recent years, research has shown that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from distribution infrastructure and other sources. A 2022 Harvard study also found that natural gas used in homes contains hazardous pollutants.

Called ""Hot & Toxic,"" the campaign's trailer is a riff on a reality television show in which 21 irritating housemates symbolizing pollutants associated with natural gas descend on an unsuspecting homeowner. The message is clear: Using natural gas inside your home is not safe.

""I did not come here to make friends,"" the actor playing Carbon Monoxide, or C.Mo, says directly to the camera as if being interviewed.

""I came here to cause chest pain, nausea and vomiting.""

In addition to the trailer, the campaign includes social media content and billboards in Los Angeles and Washington. It is sponsored by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises and manages charitable giving.

""We really took a lot of care to design it in the most engaging way possible so it feels like a reality TV show,"" James Hadgis, a filmmaker who was tapped to run the Gas Leaks Project as its executive director, said in an interview. ""I hope it brings people in to want to watch it and make it fun and funny and click to learn more.""

Asked to comment on the campaign, the American Gas Association trade group said natural gas is fundamental to energy security, economic prosperity and achieving the nation's environmental goals.

""Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,"" AGA President Karen Harbert said in a statement.

Though the campaign is kicking off with warnings about the public health impacts of natural gas, Hadgis said he is eager to produce more content focused on climate.

Gas Leaks Project was created by a coalition of firms focused on climate communications, including Fossil Free Media, Energy Media, Sunstone Strategies and Climate Nexus.

""A lot of climate messaging is really boring,"" said Jamie Henn, founder of Fossil Free Media. ""We need to be out there talking to people a little less like their science teachers and a little more like their best friends.""",mvariety.com,news,Marianas Variety News & Views,Reuters,0.1686274509803922,448954520,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mvariety.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/30/d308e3a4-e99e-11ee-a3be-b39c2b7568de/65ffb9509ec21.image.jpg?crop=1846%2C969%2C0%2C76&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9421201

The lawsuit, which names President Joe Biden, the Department of Energy (DOE) and high-ranking DOE officials as defendants, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from the pause, which the White House announced on Jan. 26 to give the DOE time to assess the climate impacts of new LNG export capacity. The states filed their challenge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, alleging that the federal government broke the law by broadly denying relevant permits.

""The LNG export ban violates the Congressional Review Act, providing further reason to conclude the LNG export ban exceeds the Department's statutory authority and is not in accordance with law,"" the lawsuit states. The filing further contends that the policy is ""arbitrary and capricious and unlawful"" under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and that it ""violates the APA because it was promulgated without notice and comment.""

The states that are suing the administration are Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.

""Biden's unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. ""The ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs.""

The decision will ultimately do nothing to reduce global emissions because it will empower foreign natural gas production in countries that do not produce gas as cleanly as the U.S., energy sector experts previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The administration's decision was met with applause from the environmental lobby, and White House national climate advisor Ali Zaidi has suggested that concerns about negative geopolitical consequences for the U.S. are overblown because many key allies are transitioning away from fossil fuels in the long-term anyways, especially in Europe. Amos Hochsetin, a key energy advisor in the Biden administration, has similarly implied that the rest of the world may not really need American LNG.",theminnesotasun.com,news,The Minnesota Sun,,-0.2705882352941177,448953663,1,https://theminnesotasun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/power-plant_840x480.jpg,eng-9419145

The arrival of spring signals significantly warmer and lighter days ahead, so what better way than to get out and explore Cumbria's majestic landscape?

James Stewart wrote in The Sunday Times: ""Transform your springtime stomps by taking the path less travelled and choosing a new route from the 173,000 acres of UK woodland, which are, in fact, vestiges of temperate rainforest.

""As well as being hotspots for thriving biodiversity, they are enchanting places to visit where you'll stumble across secret gorges and spot rare birdlife.

""Here are the ones worth pulling on your wellies for -- with lovely places to put your feet up afterwards.""

""The RSPB has taken Naddle Farm in the east Lake District under its wing to protect a tract of ancient forest where walkers can come to spot pied flycatchers, ring ouzels, peregrine falcons and merlins,"" Stewart said.

He continued: ""The reserve also includes a mosaic of upland habitats -- where you can spot fell ponies grazing -- and Haweswater Reservoir itself.""

‘The Houthis attacked the MV Huang despite previously stating they would not attack Chinese vessels,’ the US military said in a statement

A Chinese-owned oil tanker was attacked off Yemen by ballistic missiles fired by Houthi rebels, who have intensified strikes on Red Sea shipping, the US military said.

The Panamanian-flagged, Chinese-owned and operated Huang Pu issued a distress call on Saturday but did not request assistance, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on social media platform X early on Sunday.

“No casualties were reported, and the vessel resumed its course,” the statement said.

The Iran-backed rebels, who control much of Yemen’s Red Sea coast, have launched dozens of missile and drone strikes on shipping over the past four months, actions they say are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

CENTCOM and the British Navy’s United Kingdom Marine Trade Operations (UKMTO) said a fire had broken out on board the ship but was extinguished within 30 minutes.

The Marinetraffic tracking website later had the vessel sailing out of the Red Sea into the Gulf of Aden heading for its next port of call which, according to maritime security agency Ambrey, was New Mangalore in India.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which UKMTO said struck 23 nautical miles west of the Yemeni port of Mokha.

CENTCOM said Houthi rebels had launched four anti-ship ballistic missiles in the Red Sea near the Huang Pu before a fifth hit the vessel.

“The Houthis attacked the MV Huang despite previously stating they would not attack Chinese vessels,” it said.

According to Ambrey, “the tanker’s registration details, including name and operator, had been changed as recently as February 2024”.

It had been registered in 2019 by British firm Union Maritime Ltd, Ambrey said, and another vessel affiliated with the same company had previously been targeted by the Houthis.

The Houthis have vowed to target Israeli, British and US ships, as well as vessels heading to Israeli ports, disrupting traffic along the vital trade route.US and UK launch new wave of strikes on Houthis over continued Red Sea attacks

The United States, which leads an international coalition meant to protect Red Sea shipping, has been hitting Houthi targets in Yemen since mid-January.

CENTCOM said that, following the attack on the Huang Pu, US forces engaged six drones launched by the Houthis, five of which crashed into the Red Sea.

...as VP Jagdeo pussyfooting on updating nation on total barrels after two years

Kaieteur News - One of the eight discoveries made by ExxonMobil Guyana Limited (EMGL) in the Stabroek Block, since 2022, holds an estimated reserve of 746 million barrels of oil.

This was disclosed by Exxon's partner, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Limited, in its 2023 Annual Results.

ExxonMobil is the operator of the Stabroek with a 45% stake, with partners CNOOC Ltd and Hess holding interests of 25% and 30%, respectively.

CNOOC said in the report that the Lancetfish discovery, which was made in April 2023, averaged some 100 million tons, which is equivalent to 746 million barrels, according to the conversion formula of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.

Despite making eight new successful discoveries in the Stabroek Block since April 2022, the ExxonMobil-led joint venture has not provided an update of the total estimated recoverable resources to the nation.

The last resource count, dated April 26, 2022, declared the recoverable resource for the Stabroek Block at nearly 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Since then, Exxon announced eight subsequent discoveries, the Seabob-1 and Kiru-Kiru-1 wells, Sailfin-1, Yarrow-1, Fangtooth SE, Lancetfish-1, and Lancetfish-2 wells, along with the recently announced Bluefin discovery.

In an invited comment, Opposition Parliamentarian, David Patterson said the nation was not being updated on its oil reserves as this would trigger massive countrywide protests for a better deal.

The previous Coalition government had accepted a 2% royalty and granted excessive tax holidays to the Contractor and its sub-contractors. Guyana merely receives 12.5 of profits, after Exxon deduct 75% each month to recover its investments.

Patterson believes that the blackout of information on the recoverable resources could be a strategic move by the oil major to avoid an intensified public pressure for renegotiation of the lopsided Production Sharing Agreement (PSA).

""If Guyanese are clamouring every single day for a renegotiation when we only have 11 billion barrels proven reserves, imagine the clamour and the outcry when they (Exxon) actually finish appraising these wells and it jumps from 11 billion barrels to say something like 40 billion barrels and the true magnitude of what Exxon has already discovered becomes known,"" the former Minister said.

ExxonMobil at a press conference in February this year told reporters that the company was not focused on updating the reserves, but on monetizing the resources found, a position that is supported by the Government of Guyana.

Vice President, Bharrat Jagdeo, who is the chief policymaker for the sector said at his Thursday press conference that government receives quarterly reports from the operator of the Block, containing updates on the reserves.

He was however reluctant to share the updated numbers and told reporters he would check whether the reports received from Exxon contained any ""proprietary information"".

Notably, while the President of ExxonMobil Guyana, Alistair Routledge said the company was no longer focused on updating the numbers, the Senior Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corporation, Neil Chapman revealed that appraisal activities are ongoing to help the company understand the resources.

This process helps to reduce the range of uncertainty in the volumes of hydrocarbons in place; define the size and configuration of the reservoir and collect data for the prediction of the performance of the reservoir during the forecasted production life.

Chapman said, ""We have six drilling ships in the basin in pretty close proximity. And these drill ships are doing a combination of what I call exploration drilling, appraisal drilling and development drilling.""",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,-0.0117647058823529,448952721,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/Block-1.jpg,eng-9416848

Kaieteur News - The current 'battle' between oil giants ExxonMobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation over the Stabroek Block is because of the lucrative Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) Guyana signed onto, Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said on Thursday at his weekly press conference.

ExxonMobil, the operator of the Stabroek Block, and its block partner CNOOC have both moved to arbitration to assert their rights over Guyana's golden oil field, the Stabroek Block. This is as a result of Chevron's US$53 billion takeover of Hess Corporation (the third-partner in the Stabroek Block).

Buying over Hess Corporation would give Chevron access to Hess' most valuable asset in Guyana. ExxonMobil Guyana holds a 45% interest, while Hess Guyana holds 30% interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited with 25% interest. The case was filed at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, arguing that Exxon and CNOOC has a right of first refusal over Hess' stake.

The Vice President was on Thursday asked to comment on the battle between the oil giants over Guyana's oil block. Jagdeo first highlighted the profitability of the Stabroek Block. He said, ""I don't think Chevron has done this because of the need to know more about reserves. I think they have seen the discoveries; the discoveries keep coming. They know that the reserve will expand in the future.""

He said that the oil block's current valuation and the anticipation of further discoveries for future earnings is what attracted Chevron. The Vice President even suggested that the US$53 billion price tag Chevron offered Hess was mostly because of the Stabroek Block.

""So, it is something that I believe is driven largely because of the need to diversify their portfolio Chevron, but also to get into a lucrative agreement and this is a lucrative agreement because of that PSA,"" Jagdeo said too.

Production from the Stabroek Block developments sits above 600,000 barrels per day (bdp) - with Exxon having the Liza 1, Liza 2 and the Payara projects online. The oil companies have embarked on an aggressive drilling campaign in the Stabroek Block targeting three other developments: Yellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail projects. It should be noted that Yellowtail and Uaru have already been approved, while Whiptail is under review awaiting government approval any day now.

The PSA the Vice President is referring to is one that is heavily criticized for benefitting the oil companies more than it does the country.

Former Minister of Natural Resources, Raphael Trotman, who served under the APNU + AFC Coalition government between 2015 and 2020, was the one who signed the heavily criticized lopsided PSA with Exxon. The 2016 deal gives Guyana an industry-low 2% royalty. Presently, Guyana shares revenue with ExxonMobil after the company deducts 75 percent towards the cost incurred to develop the resources in the Stabroek Block.

This arrangement, with the lack of ring-fencing, sees Guyana paying for projects that are yet to commence production activities. Each month bills from future producing developments are added to the list of expenses to be cost recovered by Exxon. After the 75 percent is deducted to pay back the oil company, Guyana then shares 50/50 of the 25 percent remaining with Exxon as profits. This amounts to 12.5 percent of profits from the operations.

Also, under the signed deal, Guyana has agreed to, under the taxation provisions, to pay ExxonMobil's share of Corporation and Income Tax. As such it would mean, that Guyana foregoes each year, billions of US dollars. On top of this, documentation to this effect is then provided to the US-based company allowing it to not have to pay any taxes in its home country for its earnings overseas.

Since the deal was made public, there have been many calls by civil society for the administration to bring ExxonMobil Guyana back to the table to carve out a better or more even deal which will garner more benefits for the country.

According to a Bloomberg report, commenting on the dispute with Chevron, CNOOC Board Secretary Xu Yugao, revealed that the company had filed for arbitration on March 15. CNOOC will do whatever it takes to protect the interests of the firm and its shareholders by legal means, he said at a briefing in Hong Kong. ""We will uphold the terms of the partners' agreement to safeguard our shareholders' interests,"" Upstream Online quotes Yugao.

On Monday, Exxon Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Darren Woods told Reuters the company filed for arbitration because discussions were not happening with Chevron and Hess around the right of first refusal provision. ""Those discussions needed to happen and hadn't been happening,"" Woods said in a Reuters article. He said Exxon wanted to have its right of first refusal recognized before it could decide on its strategy for the Stabroek block. An Exxon executive has said the arbitration could take five to six months.",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,-0.04313725490196074,448952720,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/BHH-1024x627.png,eng-9416848

- accompanied by Dominican Republic Chamber of Commerce

Kaieteur News - Former United States of America (U.S.A.) President William Jefferson Clinton (Bill Clinton) is scheduled to arrive in Guyana this week to scope out opportunities in the country's rapidly developing Oil and Gas Sector.

This is according to Ambassador of the Dominican Republic to Guyana, Ernesto Torres Pereyra who said that members of the Dominican Chamber of Commerce will accompany the former American President.

At a press conference on Saturday at the Embassy of the Dominican Republic, the Ambassador said, ""I think the most important drivers of the whole process of development of this country besides the government which has had an incredible role, (is) the private sector. So, in the case of President Clinton he has very close relationship, (that is) to keep players in the private sector of the Dominican Republic.""

He explained that Former President Clinton, ""expressed his desire to understand more of the process that has been taking place here in Guyana, and since we have people like Rolando Gonzalez Bunster from Inter Energy and all the other members of our Chamber of Commerce are definitely coming to explore the opportunities. They decided to come together. So, they can also present that notion of the United Caribbean altogether.""

The Ambassador added: ""We are extremely excited of the recent developments, the possibility through the Chamber of Commerce of bringing in the former president William Jefferson Clinton to Guyana. That shows that truly Guyana is in the focus of the international community (and) for good reasons, so we are extremely excited.""

Commending both President Ali and President Abinader on their achievements so far he noted, ""they both have been very vocal of the importance of offering the people of the Caribbean a set of new strategies to bring the Caribbean together and to show the world that with that determination they can continue to promote the idea that the Caribbean is the region of potential, a region of peace, (and it can) attract foreign investment.""

The Ambassador boasted that, ""The fact that President Clinton comes also is a simulative station of that notion. The fact that he decides to come to participate in the forum shows that we all trust the process that is taking place here and trust is essential when it comes to investment.""

THE FORUM

The media was informed that the forum at which the Former U.S. President will be speaking, will take place on Tuesday, March 26 at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre.

""I believe Former President and current Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo who will also participate in the forum... Rolando Gonzalez Bunster from Inter Energy will also be participating. I think Peter Ramsaroop from GoInvest too will also offer some remarks and after the panel discussion there will be some further discussions by President Clinton and a couple of other invitees,"" he said.

Ambassador Pereyra added that this is the first edition of the United Caribbean Panel, where discussions surrounding, ""what we referred (to) before that notions of how strong we can be as a region if we unite our efforts, to develop the structures, (and) to ensure our security in many key areas like energy, food and also to bring all the private sectors of all the countries together, to continue enhancing and developing the capabilities and capacities. The key players honestly, they are really, really excited with this possibility.""

He told the media that being able to host, ""a personality of this calibre personally and professionally it means a lot. But when it comes to Guyana, I believe it sends the message that for good reasons, Guyana is attracting attention.""",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,0.2862745098039217,448952256,26,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/EX-1.jpg,eng-9421765

Mar 24, 2024 ExxonMobil, News, Oil & Gas

Kaieteur News - As the Gas-to-Energy (GTE) pipeline, being constructed by ExxonMobil Guyana Limited (EMGL) moves closer to completion, key issues regarding the controversial venture is still to be addressed.

The most hazardous risk associated with the project is a leaking pipeline that can threaten health and even result in an explosion. The pipeline passes through a number of residential communities, farmlands, waterways and roadways in proximity to public facilities such as schools and businesses; however the question of compensation in the event of a disaster is still to be addressed.

Exxon hosted an Open House discussion on Tuesday at Aracari Resort, Versailles, West Bank Demerara where the public had an opportunity to ask questions and share their concerns on the project. A number of citizens seized the opportunity to engage Exxon and the company's subcontractors, hired to complete the offshore and onshore structures.

This newspaper caught up with the GTE Project Manager, Friedrich Krispin who provided an update on the construction of the pipeline. He was also asked how the company would handle compensation for residents affected by an explosion or any unfortunate incident that occurs during the operation of the pipeline. Krispin said that while these are matters discussed by the oil company, he was unable to address the issue.

He explained, ""I can tell you that by principle, the most important thing that we can do is to build this pipeline to the highest standards and operate it to the highest standard so there will never be a leak of any kind. Whether we sit down and talk about different scenarios, yes we do, we're contemplating. Can I tell you what exactly we're gonna do with compensation, I don't think I can tell you that today.""

EMGL had submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), highlighting the risks associated with the project, as well as measures to mitigate those potential scenarios.

It was stated that gas leaks, and worse yet explosions are likely to occur as a result of corrosion, objects striking the pipeline, and a buildup of stress in the pipe wall, causing buckling. Even though this hazard was identified, Exxon's Consultant did not see it fit to also attach a detailed response plan, accompanied by the various scenarios in which such an event can occur.

The operator is now in the process of completing that study.

In the meantime, there is no word on insurance or liability coverage for the pipeline aspect of the GTE project.

This is particularly concerning, as citizens are now before the Court fighting for ExxonMobil to provide full protection for the state and its neighbours in the event of an oil spill that occurs at the Stabroek Block, where over 600,000 barrels of oil per day is now being produced.

The GTE project will utilize gas from the Liza One and Liza Two fields in the Stabroek Block. Exxon is responsible for the pipeline that will be used to transport the gas to the Wales development site to be utilized for power generation and the sale of remaining liquids.

Government is building a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) facility to treat and separate the gas in addition to a 300 megawatt power plant.

ExxonMobil told this newspaper on Tuesday that the pipeline is already 50% complete and will be handed over to government by year end, in accordance with its initial timeline.

The pipeline will transport up to approximately 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of dry gas to the NGL Plant, according to the EIA submitted by Exxon.",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,-0.05098039215686279,448952113,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/Krispin.jpg,

Or follow us on Google News!

We increased our forecast prices for crude oil and petroleum products for the remainder of 2024 in our March Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) following the announcement that OPEC+ will extend the existing voluntary production cuts through the second quarter of 2024. We now forecast significantly less global oil production than world oil consumption through the first half of 2024, requiring draws on world petroleum stocks (inventory). Stock draws tend to increase oil prices.

We reduced our forecast for world oil production in the second quarter of 2024 (2Q24) to 101.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in the March STEO in response to OPEC+ extending its cuts. That results in global oil production that is 0.9 million b/d less than our forecast of 102.2 million b/d for world oil consumption. Although we expected some OPEC+ countries to continue to restrict production, we expect the March 3 announcement to result in larger cuts to production than we had previously assumed. The announcement includes an additional voluntary production cut from Russia.

The current OPEC+ agreement includes two types of production cuts. The first type is officially stated production targets, and the second type is additional voluntary cuts pledged by certain OPEC+ countries. Although our previous forecast assumed that some OPEC+ members would maintain voluntary cuts -- which had been set to expire after 1Q24 -- through 2Q24, this new announcement pledges that cuts will be continued for all member countries through the first half of 2024. Because OPEC+ did not relax production targets and because Russia added new voluntary production cuts, market participants will have to withdraw oil from stocks to meet demand, which puts upward pressure on oil prices.

The draw on global oil stocks during 2024 will keep Brent crude oil prices elevated, averaging $88/b in 2Q24, $4/b higher than we had forecast in the February STEO. Prices will remain relatively flat for the rest of the year before falling to $82/b by the end of 2025 as OPEC+ supply cuts expire and production increases.

Several factors present uncertainties to our forecast:

Crude oil prices make up more than 50% of U.S. retail gasoline prices. Refining costs fluctuate seasonally but usually determine between 10%-25% of the retail gasoline price. Distribution costs and taxes make up the rest. Following large planned and unplanned refinery outages in the United States in recent weeks, we increased our refining margin forecast, which is the difference between the wholesale gasoline price and the Brent crude oil price. Both higher crude oil prices and refining margins led us to increase our regular-grade retail gasoline price forecast by 20 cents per gallon for June, July, and August from what we forecast in the February STEO.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,,-0.08235294117647063,448952011,1,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-oil-production-increases.png,

The Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, gave the estimate at the 2024 edition of CERAWeek, a global oil and gas event in Houston, the United States, organised by S&P Global.

The programme which ended on Friday was themed: ""Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, Climate, Technology and Geopolitics.""

Kyari argued that the main focus of the NNPC at the moment, is building capacity to deliver gas into the domestic market, reiterating that Nigeria remains a gas country with associated oil rather than the other way round.

Nigeria has over 208 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of proven gas reserves and about 600 TCF in potential reserves, but can hardly get the resource out of the ground due to lack of infrastructure and the much-needed investment in the sector.

But highlighting the ongoing conversations around energy transition, the NNPCL GCEO noted that the country takes the issue of energy availability very seriously as well as the cheapest route to explore it.

The NNPC's chief executive argued that there is now a clear opportunity that gas has today, which wasn't there 10 years ago, explaining that the NNPC and its partners are building a number of trunk lines that will supply gas within the network.

According to the GCEO, within the next three to four years, there will likely be in-country gas infrastructure to raise supply, especially domestically.

""What we see is that we will probably need between $10 billion to $15 billion in two to three years. That should cover the immediate gap. And of course, looking beyond providing gas in the domestic market, which is to see how relationships and partnerships can create gas for export.

""And of course, when you look at that, and then probably you see another incremental $10 billion to $12 billion which will create the opportunity for growth,"" he stated.

Besides, the NNPC helmsman said that there is an ongoing engagement, which has reached a very advanced stage to create a pipeline that can pass through 13 African countries into Morocco and then to Europe, estimated at $25 billion.

He mentioned the ongoing construction of the NLNG Train 7, expressing the hope that it will likely double Nigeria's current capacity in the liquefied natural gas space when completed.

""Also, we are working on two other projects. One is the fixed LNG project and we have reached an advanced stage of commitment so that we can bring back another 10 million tonnes facility in the country, and several other floating LNG projects.

""But obviously, we have a line of sight around at least three to four LNG projects. We are also engaging our partners to see how we can add another train on the LNG making it eight. We see huge opportunities,"" he pointed out.

Both CENTCOM and the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed that a fire broke out on the ship but was quickly put out within half an hour.

""March 23, the Iranian-backed Houthis launched four anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) into the Red Sea in the vicinity of M/V Huang Pu, a Panamanian-flagged, Chinese-owned, Chinese-operated oil tanker.At 4.25 pm (Sanaa time), a fifth ballistic missile was detected as fired toward M/V Huang Pu. The ship issued a distress call but did not request assistance. M/V Huang Pu suffered minimal damage, and a fire on board was extinguished within 30 minutes.

The attack, which struck 23 nautical miles west of the Yemeni port of Mokha, had no immediate claim of responsibility. Despite the rebels previously stating they would not target Chinese vessels, they launched five anti-ship ballistic missiles at the Huang Pu, as disclosed by CENTCOM.""The tanker's registration details, including name and operator, had been changed as recently as February 2024"", according to maritime security agency Ambrey.

Originally registered in 2019 by British firm Union Maritime Ltd, the vessel had connections to a company previously targeted by the Houthis. The rebels have threatened to attack ships from Israel, the UK, and the US, as well as those heading to Israeli ports, disrupting trade in the region.Following the assault on the Huang Pu, US forces intercepted six drones launched by the rebels, with five crashing into the Red Sea and the sixth entering a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen, as per CENTCOM.

The United States, leading an international coalition to safeguard Red Sea shipping, has been targeting Houthi positions in Yemen since mid-January.The rebels, backed by Iran, have been targeting ships in the Red Sea frequently over the past few months in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.(With AFP inputs)

Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi on March 20 commissioned the first round of auction of oil and gas blocks to investors as a step towards implementing the blue economy agenda.

Speaking during an event held at the Golden Tulip Hotel, Dr Mwinyi said the government had reviewed the legal and contractual frameworks around oil and natural gas before launching the round, to attract investors into the hydrocarbon industry.

""We made the review to create a friendly investment environment in the oil and gas sector here in Zanzibar because companies need to invest in a safe place where they can be profitable,"" said Dr Mwinyi, assuring investors that the government was committed to creating a favourable investment environment.

The launch opened up oil and gas exploration activities in the new offshore blocks.

The eighth-phase government has embarked on the ""blue economy"" policy, which places the oil and gas sector among the main priority areas.

""The government believes that the blue economy has many opportunities to promote economic development plans that aim at reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities,"" said Dr Mwinyi.

He said that the exploration activities for oil and gas in Zanzibar started in the 1950s with the British Petroleum (BP) Company, in collaboration with Shell, conducting detailed investigations and drilling two wells on both sides of Unguja and Pemba, which were completed in 1963.

He said that after the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964, oil and gas exploration activities were under the government of the United Republic of Tanzania through the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC).

Various studies were conducted on the mainland and offshore of Zanzibar, leading to the identification of blocks in Zanzibar.

The Minister for Blue Economy and Fisheries in Zanzibar, Mr Shaaban Ali Othman, said eight blocks out of the 12 existing blocks were launched yesterday.

""We are waiting for applications from investors for the eight blocks that are up for grabs in the next 10 years,"" he said, welcoming investors.

He said both the laws governing the sector and the production sharing agreement (PSA) model were reviewed to facilitate investment.

The chief executive officer of the Zanzibar Petroleum Regulatory Authority (ZPRA), Mr Adam Abdallah Makame, said that within six months, they will provide an opportunity for investors to submit applications and purchase data about the blocks.

The regulator will then evaluate the applications and find an investor who can invest in the blocks.

He said that in searching for a company to invest in the blocks, the government prioritises expertise and also provides an opportunity for more than one company to collaborate to apply for one block.

""In our analysis, we focus more on professional capability than financial capacity,"" he said.

The chief executive officer of the Zanzibar Petroleum Development Corporation (ZPDC), Mr Mikidadi Alli Rashid, said the investors will sign the PSA model with the minister and ZPDC to officially start oil and gas exploration and drilling.

He said that after signing the agreement, they will negotiate to determine what each party will get from each block.

""So far, not less than five companies have shown interest in investing in Zanzibar,"" said Mr Rashid without naming the companies.

In managing expectations, he urged residents to be patient, as oil and gas exploration and potential development take time.",thecitizen.co.tz,news,The Citizen,,0.2549019607843137,448951307,26,https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/resource/image/4563530/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/635faa279f6025a659ec0e079e947dc8/fc/oil-pics.jpg,eng-9417071

The government has allowed Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to export crude oil it has stored in underground strategic storages at Mangalore to give operational flexibility to the foreign firm, an order of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said on Saturday. At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85% of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under USD 130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a USD 20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.08235294117647052,448950991,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108743775,imgsize-252348,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/industry/coal-the-dirtiest-fossil-fuel-is-preparing-for-a-long-goodbye.jpg",

In January of this year, Azerbaijan exported 28,058.72 tons of oil products worth 17,434.46 thousand US dollars.

The State Customs Committee, the value of the oil products exported by Azerbaijan during the reporting period decreased by 2.6 times and the volume by 2.4 times compared to the corresponding period of 2023. Last year, Azerbaijan exported 925,225.07 oil products worth 572,210.25 thousand US dollars.

It should be noted that during the reporting period, the value of the oil products exported by Azerbaijan increased by 8.5% and the volume by 20% compared to the indicator of 2022. The change in the oil product export also raised some questions about the reasons and perspectives behind the matter.

Speaking on the issue to Azernews, American expert Peter Tase, while explaining the reasons, noted that the legislation approved by the National Assembly of Azerbaijan in support of defending the environmental resources and development of green energy are an outstanding move that will improve the economic prosperity of Azerbaijan and have increased environmental results towards the European continent. ""These actions delivered by Azerbaijan are ambitious and ought to be followed by the world's most developed nations.""

According to him, Baku is seriously promoting the renewable energy industry. ""The traditional forms of energy that have powered human progress over the last century are evolving and Azerbaijan under the guidance and statecraft of President Ilham Aliyev, has become a beacon of prosperity and democracy in Eurasia. The demand for affordable and reliable energy is only increasing and Baku is rapidly shifting towards renewable energy,"" he added.

""The challenge at hand is how to continue to power human progress in a way that is reliable and affordable but also, critically, more sustainable and equitable; these tenets are artfully and vigorously being perfected by the scientists and leadership of Azerbaijan,"" Tase concluded. -- Azer news",pakobserver.net,news,Pakistan Observer,,0.3803921568627451,448950675,1,https://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Oil-gains-as-OPEC-resumes-output-cut-extension-talks-after-impasse.jpg,

This is causing expansion issues in the LNG industry as needed investment capital by the industry is negatively impacted.

The Biden administration says they are pausing the permitting while they study climate change. However, the Biden administration is also unilaterally sending LNG to Europe to support the NATO objective to hamper the Russian economy (not working).

As a consequence, the Biden administration (think Biden family) is controlling the outflow of LNG; essentially putting themselves in a position of financial influence over the LNG industry. Who is controlling whom, and why?

HOUSTON, Texas -- The liquefied natural gas industry has criticized the Biden administration for pausing export permits on LNG as uncertainties arise for developers planning massive amounts of investment.

Major U.S. exporter Freeport LNG's Chief Executive Officer Michael Smith said Wednesday in an interview on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that ""you won't get this resolved till after the presidential elections"" in November.

The U.S. Department of Energy, which issues permits for LNG export projects to countries that are not part of free trade agreements, announced in January that the government will pause permits to review how the projects affect climate change, national security and the economy.

The world's largest LNG exporter's sudden policy announcement has rippled through Asia, the largest consumer of the gas.

On Monday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the audience at CERAWeek that the review will be in the ""rear-view mirrors"" by March next year. However, the secretary's comments have not satisfied LNG companies.

""I am encouraged by the secretary's comments, but I think that there's still some significant risk that the timing will slip from what she said,"" Smith said, pointing to similar study done by the Obama administration more than a decade ago, which led to a lengthier permitting process.",theconservativetreehouse.com,news,The Last Refuge,,0.1529411764705881,448950488,1,https://theconservativetreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/joe-and-hunter-biden.jpg,eng-9418167

Today's Highlight in History:

On March 24, 1989, the supertanker Exxon Valdez (vahl-DEEZ') ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and began leaking an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil.

On this date:

In 1765, Britain enacted the Quartering Act, requiring American colonists to provide temporary housing to British soldiers.

In 1832, a mob in Hiram, Ohio, attacked, tarred and feathered Mormon leaders Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon.

In 1882, German scientist Robert Koch announced in Berlin that he had discovered the bacillus responsible for tuberculosis.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill granting future independence to the Philippines.

In 1976, the president of Argentina, Isabel Peron, was deposed by her country's military.

In 1980, one of El Salvador's most respected Roman Catholic Church leaders, Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was shot to death by a sniper as he celebrated Mass in San Salvador.

In 1995, after 20 years, British soldiers stopped routine patrols in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

In 1999, NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, marking the first time in its 50-year existence that it had ever attacked a sovereign country.

In 2010, keeping a promise he'd made to anti-abortion Democratic lawmakers to assure passage of his historic health care legislation, President Barack Obama signed an executive order against using federal funds to pay for elective abortions covered by private insurance.

In 2013, hundreds of thousands marched in Paris protesting the imminent legalization of same-sex marriage. (It would be signed into law just over two months later).

In 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525, an Airbus A320, crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board; investigators said the jetliner was deliberately downed by the 27-year-old co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz.

In 2016, a U.N. war crimes court convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide and nine other charges for orchestrating a campaign of terror that left 100,000 people dead during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia; Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison. (The sentence was later increased to life in prison.)

In 2018, in the streets of the nation's capital and in cities across the country, hundreds of thousands of teenagers and their supporters rallied against gun violence, spurred by a call to action from student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

In 2020, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Summer Olympics in Tokyo would be postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus.

In 2021, Jessica Walter, whose roles included a scheming matriarch on TV's ""Arrested Development"" and a stalker in the film ""Play Misty for Me,"" died at 80.

Today is Sunday, March 24, the 84th day of 2024. There are 282 days left in the year.

Today's Highlight in History:

On March 24, 1989, the supertanker Exxon Valdez (vahl-DEEZ') ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and began leaking an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil.

On this date:

In 1765, Britain enacted the Quartering Act, requiring American colonists to provide temporary housing to British soldiers.

In 1832, a mob in Hiram, Ohio, attacked, tarred and feathered Mormon leaders Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon.

In 1882, German scientist Robert Koch announced in Berlin that he had discovered the bacillus responsible for tuberculosis.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill granting future independence to the Philippines.

In 1976, the president of Argentina, Isabel Peron, was deposed by her country's military.

In 1980, one of El Salvador's most respected Roman Catholic Church leaders, Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was shot to death by a sniper as he celebrated Mass in San Salvador.

In 1995, after 20 years, British soldiers stopped routine patrols in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

In 1999, NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, marking the first time in its 50-year existence that it had ever attacked a sovereign country.

In 2010, keeping a promise he'd made to anti-abortion Democratic lawmakers to assure passage of his historic health care legislation, President Barack Obama signed an executive order against using federal funds to pay for elective abortions covered by private insurance.

In 2013, hundreds of thousands marched in Paris protesting the imminent legalization of same-sex marriage. (It would be signed into law just over two months later).

In 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525, an Airbus A320, crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board; investigators said the jetliner was deliberately downed by the 27-year-old co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz.

In 2016, a U.N. war crimes court convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide and nine other charges for orchestrating a campaign of terror that left 100,000 people dead during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia; Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison. (The sentence was later increased to life in prison.)

In 2018, in the streets of the nation's capital and in cities across the country, hundreds of thousands of teenagers and their supporters rallied against gun violence, spurred by a call to action from student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

In 2020, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Summer Olympics in Tokyo would be postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus.

In 2021, Jessica Walter, whose roles included a scheming matriarch on TV's ""Arrested Development"" and a stalker in the film ""Play Misty for Me,"" died at 80.

Oil Kings 7

It was an ugly game for the Red Deer Rebels.

After three goals that were redirected off skates in front of the net gave the Oil Kings a 3-0 lead it only got worse for the Rebels who fell 7-3 on Saturday night at the Peavey Mart Centrium.

Head coach Dave Struch said it was not only a tough loss but a disappointing effort.

""After three weeks all of the work that they've put in and the commitment they've had towards each other for each other to get better, we've only seen one bad period in Lethbridge last week,"" he said.

""I'm really disappointed to see the effort they put forth tonight.""

The Oil Kings found the back of the net midway through the first period. Edmonton's Gracyn Sawchyn made a push toward the net and after he was knocked down it redirected off his skate and into the net.

Less than a minute into the second period, the Oil Kings extended their lead when Marshall Finnie fired in his 20th of the year that redirected off a skate in front.

Seven minutes later, the Rebels got into penalty trouble. With two guys in the penalty box, the Oil Kings took a 3-0 lead on the 5-on-3 powerplay scored by Adam Jecho.

""Three goals off skates but that's still not an excuse,"" Struch added. ""We were energy takers tonight and we needed energy givers. We didn't have enough of it.""

Red Deer broke the shutout midway through the frame when rookie forward Jeramiah Roberts buried an opportunity on the offensive rush off the pass from Quentin Bourne.

Four minutes later, Gavin Hodnett put the Oil Kings up by three once again and they didn't stop there. With less than two minutes to go, Oil Kings Skyler Bruce scored their fifth of the game on the offensive rush after he was left alone in front of the net.

In the third period, Roberts scored his second of the game to cut into Edmonton's lead just minutes into the final frame.

However, that was as close as Red Deer would get. Shortly after, Edmonton scored two goals within a minute of each other from Jecho and Smyth Rebman to lead 7-2.

As a result, the Rebels made a goaltending change taking out Chase Wutzke after he let in seven goals on 26 shots. Netminder Rhett Stoesser stepped in and made 10 saves in the third period.

Red Deer scored one more before the end of the period off the stick of defenceman Mats Lindgren.

The Rebels will now wrap up the regular season in Edmonton on Sunday at 4 p.m. before kicking off their first-round playoff series against the Medicine Hat Tigers next week.

All week Struch has preached playing the right way heading into the playoffs. He hopes to see more of that on Sunday.

It is based on a three-year average of polling.

What struck me in their report is how unhappy the Middle East is. The only Middle Eastern country in the top twenty is Kuwait (for the first time in this cycle). Kuwait has oil wealth and is a compact country with lots of social interaction. The high score may reflect Kuwait's lively labor movement. That sort of movement isn't allowed in the other Gulf States. The United Arab Emirates came in at 22, and Saudi Arabia at 28.

These countries are all very wealthy and their people are very social and connected to clans and other group identities, including religious congregations.

But everyone else in the Middle East is way down the list.

As usual, Gallup found that the very happiest countries were Scandinavian lands shaped by social democratic policies. It turns out that a government safety net of the sort the Republican Party wants to get rid of actually is key to making people happy.

Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden take the top four spots. Israel, which also has a Labor socialist founding framework, is fifth. The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Luxembourg fill out the top nine.

The Gallup researchers believe that a few major considerations affect well-being or happiness. They note, ""Social interactions of all kinds ... add to happiness, in addition to their effects flowing through increases in social support and reductions in loneliness."" My brief experience of being in Australia suggests to me that they are indeed very social and likely not very lonely on the whole. Positive emotions also equate to well-being and are much more important in determining it than negative emotions. The positive emotions include joy, gratitude, serenity, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and altruism, among others.

Benevolence, doing good to others, also adds to well-being. Interestingly, the Gallup researchers find that benevolence increased in COVID and its aftermath across the board.

They also factor in GDP per capita, that is, how poor or wealthy people are.

Bahrain comes in at 62, which shows that oil wealth isn't everything. It is deeply divided between a Sunni elite and a Shiite majority population, and that sectarian tension likely explains why it isn't as happy as Kuwait. Kuwait is between a sixth and a third Shiite and also has a Sunni elite, but the Shiites are relatively well treated and the Emir depends on them to offset the power of Sunni fundamentalists. So it isn't just sectarian difference that affects happiness but the way in which the rulers deal with it.

Libya, which is more or less a failed state after the people rose up to overthrow dictator Moammar Gaddafi, nevertheless comes in at 66. There is some oil wealth when the militias allow its export, and despite the east-west political divide, people are able to live full lives in cities like Benghazi and Tripoli. Maybe the overhang of getting rid of a hated dictator is still a source of happiness for them.

Algeria, a dictatorship and oil state, is 85. The petroleum wealth is not as great as in the Gulf by any means, and is monopolized by the country's elite.

Iraq, an oil state, is 92. Like Bahrain, it suffers from ethnic and sectarian divides. It is something of a failed state after the American overthrow of its government.

Iran, another oil state, is 100. Its petroleum sales are interfered with by the US except with regard to China, so its income is much more limited than other Gulf oil states. The government is dictatorial and young people seem impatient with its attempt to regiment their lives, as witnessed in the recent anti-veiling protests.

The State of Palestine is 103, which is actually not bad given that they are deeply unhappy with being occupied by Israel. This ranking certainly plummeted after the current Israeli total war on Gaza began.

Morocco is 107. It is relatively poor, in fact poorer than some countries that rank themselves much lower on the happiness scale.

Tunisia is one of the wealthier countries in Africa and much better off than Morocco, but it comes in at 115. In the past few years all the democratic gains made during and after the Arab Spring have been reversed by horrid dictator Qais Saied. People seem to be pretty unhappy at now living in a seedy police state.

Jordan is both poor and undemocratic, and is ranked 125.

Egypt is desperately poor and its government since 2014 has been a military junta in business suits that brooks not the slightest dissent. It is 127. The hopes of the Arab Spring are now ashes.

Yemen is 133. One of the poorest countries in the world, it suffered from being attacked by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from 2015 until 2021. So it is war torn and poverty-stricken.

Lebanon ranks almost at the bottom at 142. Its economy is better than Yemen's but its government is hopelessly corrupt and its negligence caused the country's major port to be blown up, plunging the country into economic crisis. It is wracked by sectarianism. If hope is a major positive emotion that leads to feelings of happiness, it is in short supply there.

Some countries are too much of a basket case to be included, like Syria, where I expect people are pretty miserable after the civil war. Likewise Sudan, which is now in civil strife and where hundreds of thousands may starve.

Poverty, dictatorship, disappointment in political setbacks, and sectarianism all seem to play a part in making the Middle East miserable. The role of the United States in supporting the dictatorships in Egypt and elsewhere, or in supporting wars, has been sinister and certainly has added significantly to the misery. For no group in the region is this more true than for the Palestinians.",juancole.com,news,Informed Comment,Juan Cole,0.192156862745098,448949964,1,https://media.juancole.com/images/2024/03/the-middle-east-ranks-at-the-bot-750x422.jpg,

That is why his administration tried ludicrously to spin the new tailpipe emissions rule as an expansion of ""consumer choice.""

""This technology-neutral and performance-based standard gives the auto industry the flexibility to choose the combination of pollution-control technologies best suited for their customers,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said last week. ""Let me be clear: Whether it's battery electric, plug-in hybrid, advanced hybrid, or cleaner gasoline vehicles, we understand that consumer choice is paramount.""

Regan's entire statement is false. The EPA regulation is designed to limit what type of cars and trucks we may buy. The rule limits carbon tailpipe emissions to levels so low that they can only be achieved by having 67% of cars and trucks sold be electric vehicles. Car companies that build too many gasoline vehicles will face billions of dollars in fines.

The EPA's message to manufacturers is clear: You must stop building gasoline cars, or we will put you out of business.

When Biden unveiled his electric vehicle mandate last year, the phaseout of gasoline cars was more aggressive, with 60% of all cars sold set to be electric by 2030 and 67% by 2032. But auto unions balked at these numbers as unrealistic. Biden has therefore slowed the implementation of the final rule while keeping the final target. Manufacturers now must have only half their fleets electric by 2030, with a sudden jump to 67% only two years later.

Electric vehicles have grown from 3% of all sales in 2021 to 8% last year, goosed by $7,500 federal tax credits. But sales have slowed again as drivers have discovered that battery-powered cars are unreliable and inconvenient. Battery range can be cut in half by cold weather or heavy loads. That doesn't even touch the fact that electric vehicle charging stations are few and far between. Even when they are available, many don't work.

As more drivers experience electric vehicles, they like the ban on gas-powered vehicles less. In 2021, just 51% of adults opposed phasing out gas-powered vehicles, according to Pew. Today, it's 59%. Excuse the tautology by drivers who want to be able to buy the cars they want to buy.

By back-ending the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles, Biden is trying to postpone the pain. But that increases uncertainty in the industry. If it becomes clearer two years from now that even the EPA's new, more lenient schedule is unrealistic, will Biden push it back again? Will he abandon his campaign promise that half of all cars sold will be electric by 2030? At some point, as the technology fails him, Biden has to admit reality, right?

Or maybe he doesn't. Even if Biden wins this year, he'll be out of office by the time the strictest EPA regulations hit. That is the next guy's problem. But it is also everyone's problem, which is why, if you want to keep gas-powered cars an option, Biden must be voted out of office.",washingtonexaminer.com,news,Washington Examiner,Washington Examiner,0.02745098039215677,448949646,1,https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AP23335086763953-scaled-e1708192518672.jpg,eng-9417990

""The rapid expansion in use is attributed to yields nearly four times other vegetable oil crops, with similar production costs; favourable characteristics for the food industry (its relatively high smoke point and being semisolid state at room temperature); and strategies aimed at ensuring government policies are supportive to the expansion of palm oil cultivation, production and use.""

While these factors work in favour of the food industry, the study added that palm oil contains ""a much higher percentage of saturated fats compared to other vegetable oils"".

Therefore, as consumers, we must be aware of the ill effects of consuming palm oil.

Specific health concerns associated with the consumption of palm oil

Sanchi Tiwari, nutritionist at Lord's Mark Biotech explains, ""Saturated fats are notorious for raising LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, which dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and strokes.""

The accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the arteries causes atherosclerosis, she adds, which narrows blood vessels and impairs crucial organ function.

Furthermore, concerns have been raised about hormonal imbalances and potential toxicity due to oxidised palm oil, according to Lovneet Batra, clinical nutritionist and founder, Nutrition by Lovneet. ""This could lead to reproductive issues and affect the health of vital organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs,"" she suggests.

Dr Asmita Sawe, nutritionist and founder of Rejoice Wellness, reveals that the World Health Organization, and the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute have directed ""consumers to limit the consumption of palm oil, palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat.""

Alternatives or strategies for consumers looking to reduce their intake of palm oil

As a nutritionist, Batra advocates for making informed choices to reduce palm oil consumption while maintaining a balanced diet. Here are some alternatives and strategies she recommends:

Choose healthier cooking oils: Opt for oils with higher levels of unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocado oil, or sunflower oil. These oils are lower in saturated fats and offer various health benefits, including improved heart health.

Read food labels: Be mindful of packaged foods and read the ingredient labels to identify products containing palm oil. Look for alternatives with healthier oil options or consider preparing meals using whole, natural ingredients whenever possible.

Cook at home: Cooking meals at home allows you to have better control over the ingredients used. Experiment with different cooking oils and explore healthier cooking methods like steaming, baking, or grilling to reduce the need for added fats.",indianexpress.com,news,The Indian Express,Lifestyle Desk,-0.0117647058823529,448949165,1,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/palm-oil-2.jpg,eng-9413228

Look at the royal power President Joe Biden just exercised.

On Wednesday, the Biden administration, through the EPA, issued new regulations on vehicle emissions. In practical terms, around two-thirds of new cars must be electric or hybrid by 2032. The EPA believes the ""most likely"" result of the requirement will be that a majority of new vehicles sold will be all-electric in 2032. Traditional, gas-powered vehicles will make up less than 30 percent of new car sales.

This would be a major change. In the fourth quarter of last year, fully electric vehicles accounted for just 8.1 percent of sales. If you include hybrids, the number was 17.7 percent in the third quarter. The number of EV sales has increased in recent years. In 2014, there were a bit under 120,000 EVs sold in the U.S. In 2023, it was around 1.6 million.

This dramatic growth didn't happen in a vacuum. Democrats have spent years tilting the playing field to EVs. There are federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 available for EV buyers. Biden pushed through $7.5 billion to build EV charging stations.

It goes beyond that, however. Even before this rule, the EPA required car companies to meet tailpipe emissions standards. Functionally, it required car companies to produce a fleet of cars with a certain miles per gallon fuel economy. Companies that didn't meet these requirements had to purchase regulatory credits to make up the difference. Regulatory credits offer nothing of value. They're essentially government-mandated permission slips that car companies need to turn in.

Since 2009, other car companies have paid Tesla $9 billion to buy its extra regulatory credits. These regulations benefit Tesla because it only makes EVs. Some credits went to satisfying requirements outside the U.S.

This didn't just enrich Tesla. These regulations pushed car companies towards EVs -- even when consumers didn't want them. This scheme added a hidden cost to gasoline-powered vehicles. It also influenced what cars would even be available. Car companies knew these requirements probably would only increase with time. It's one reason why they've invested heavily in EV technology, though it doesn't make financial sense.

In the third quarter of last year, Ford lost around $36,000 on every EV it sold. In total. Ford lost $4.7 billion on EVs last year. Car companies weren't anticipating consumer demand, but regulatory requirements.

Customers, however, aren't buying. Last November, CNBC reported, ""EV sales have slowed."" Dealerships reported that EVs weren't moving. Companies, including Tesla, lowered prices to try to increase demand. Ford announced it was scaling back its EV investment.

It's easy to see why consumers are hesitant. For one, charging a vehicle can take a few minutes or a many hours depending on a variety of factors. Finding an available charger on a road trip is a level of hassle and stress that's hard to plan around.

Biden's move to institute an artificial limit on gas-powered cars is a terrible idea. But take a step back. How this happened should be even more concerning. The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the ability to make laws. Set aside another concerning fact, that the Founders didn't give the federal government this much authority.

A de facto EV mandate came from the president. The executive branch is supposed to execute the laws, not make them. Giving the president the ability to make sweeping new laws, under the guise of regulations, makes a mockery of the separation of powers and destroys the constitutional order.

Put another way: Biden's royal dictate banning many gas-powered cars would make King George blush.",reviewjournal.com,news,Las Vegas Review-Journal,,-0.003921568627450966,448949157,1,https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18987652_web1_17426380-b979f8e0e2bb463ea4064cacbcfad3d4.jpg,eng-9418000

Also handed over to the NSCDC were two tugboats, two badges, and nine storage facilities with an unspecified quantity of crude oil.

Commander of NNS Delta, Commodore Abba Muhsin, disclosed that the suspects were apprehended on March 8, this year at WATSON jetty, Edjeba in Warri South Local Government Area of the state.

Commodore Muhsin, who was represented during the handing over of the suspects and other facilities by Base Operations Officer, Commander Patrick Onoja Ali, was nabbed following an intelligence report about the activities of the suspected oil thieves.

""On March 8, this year, NNS Delta got intelligence on some suspected illegal oil bunkering operations happening at WATSON jetty, Edjeba in Warri. So, our men were deployed to this location. We conducted raids from different locations and at the end, 10 suspects, two tug boats, two badges, and nine storage facilities were apprehended,"" he said.

Muhsin warned perpetrators of illegal oil bunkering to steer clear of NNS Delta's area of operations vowing they would be tracked down and made to face the full wrath of the law.

""Our target are those who hide under legal means to perpetrate oil-related illegalities and those who outrightly perpetrate such illegalities. If you do not change, we will unbundle and flush you out of Delta.

""This is one of the series of actions, in support of Operations Delta Sanity of the Nigerian Navy and Operations Delta Safe of Defence Headquarters as part of the Navy's Coast Guard functions towards nation building,"" he said.

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's ""huge"" state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group -- oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

""In that region, oil is cheaper than water,"" notes Rettig. ""The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.""

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

""The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,"" she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

""China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors -- in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,"" she said. ""Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.""

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first ""hydrogen society.""

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.3568627450980393,448948151,1,,

Officials in two Russian regions bordering Ukraine say Ukrainian drones have killed two people and hit an oil refinery, setting it on fire.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said several drone and missile strikes killed a man and a woman in Belgorod city and in one of its suburbs.

""In Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building -- a married couple was in one of these apartments. To great grief, the man died on the spot from his wounds before the arrival of the ambulance crew,"" Gladkov said on Telegram, adding that a second person, a woman, was killed and two were wounded in Chernyansky district.

Belgorod has been hit repeatedly over the months by Ukrainian strikes. While casualties have been relatively low, the attacks have rattled local residents, and caused an exodus of people.

Russian military authorities have struggled to repel the Ukrainian air attacks, as well as several ground incursions by groups allegedly linked to Ukrainian intelligence.

In the Samara region, hundreds of kilometers from the Ukrainian border, the Kuibyshev and Novokuibyshev oil refineries were attacked by drones early on March 23, said the governor of the region, Dmitry Azarov.

At Kuibyshev, a massive blaze was sparked by the strike, but the attack at the second was repulsed, Azarov said, adding that there were no deaths or injuries.

The Kuibyshev refinery is one of the largest in the region.

The attack came just days after news reports said U.S. officials had asked Ukrainian authorities to stop targeting Russia's oil infrastructure.

Ukraine has continued its monthslong campaign of using drones to target Russian oil and other infrastructure. The effort has partially disrupted Russian gasoline supplies, and driven domestic prices higher.

Fears that disrupted Russian oil prices could ripple through global markets prompted U.S. officials to quietly urge Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported March 22.

The repeated warnings were delivered to senior officials at Ukraine's state security service, its military intelligence directorate, three unnamed officials were quoted as saying.

An official in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office later denied the report.

There have been at least 12 attacks on major Russian refineries since 2022, and at least nine this year, the Financial Times reported.

The Eagles earned 434 points, their lowest winning point total, to secure the win over runner-up Kenyon (391).

Emory only won two events -- one individual and one relay -- but used a deep team to amass the most points by the end of the meet. 13 of their 18 qualifiers scored in individual events, while two more were key members of relays. Day 1 was Emory's weakest, as they sat back in 3rd at the end of the session, but they flew into the lead on day 2 and didn't look back. The only events they had no scorers in were the 200 IM and the diving events, though they had no divers on their roster this year.

The Eagles were led by a strong upperclassmen contingent. Benjamin Thorsen was their top individual scorer, earning 44 points thanks to his performances in the 500 free (4:26.34, 6th), 400 IM (3:51.84, 1st), and 200 fly (1:48.47, 8th). The junior also contributed to Emory's runner-up 800 freestyle relay and 5th-placing 400 freestyle relay.

105 of Emory's points were earned by the class of 2024: Nicholas Goudie, Jake Meyer, and Ryan Soh all capped off excellent collegiate campaigns. Meyer was the runner-up in both breaststroke events, but the sting of his departure is lessened by the performances of Henri Bonnault and Liyang Sun at these championships, who are carrying forward a strong Emory tradition.

The younger Thorsen, Harrison Thorsen, had an excellent first NCAAs. He swam the exact same line-up as his older brother, making two B-final appearances in the 500 free (12th) and 400 IM (9th) before besting his brother in the 200 fly in his first A-final appearance (6th).

Emory brought the maximum 18 athletes to NCAAs, all of whom were swimmers.",swimswam.com,news,SwimSwam,Laura Rosado,0.3411764705882352,448947950,1,https://swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/emory-men-2024-d3-champions.jpg,

Also handed over to the NSCDC were two tugboats, two badges, and nine storage facilities with an unspecified quantity of crude oil.

Commander of NNS Delta, Commodore Abba Muhsin, disclosed that the suspects were apprehended on March 8, this year at WATSON jetty, Edjeba in Warri South Local Government Area of the state.

Commodore Muhsin, who was represented during the handing over of the suspects and other facilities by Base Operations Officer, Commander Patrick Onoja Ali, was nabbed following an intelligence report about the activities of the suspected oil thieves.

""On March 8, this year, NNS Delta got intelligence on some suspected illegal oil bunkering operations happening at WATSON jetty, Edjeba in Warri. So, our men were deployed to this location. We conducted raids from different locations and at the end, 10 suspects, two tug boats, two badges, and nine storage facilities were apprehended,"" he said.

Muhsin warned perpetrators of illegal oil bunkering to steer clear of NNS Delta's area of operations vowing they would be tracked down and made to face the full wrath of the law.

""Our target are those who hide under legal means to perpetrate oil-related illegalities and those who outrightly perpetrate such illegalities. If you do not change, we will unbundle and flush you out of Delta.

""This is one of the series of actions, in support of Operations Delta Sanity of the Nigerian Navy and Operations Delta Safe of Defence Headquarters as part of the Navy's Coast Guard functions towards nation building,"" he said.

Commander NNS Delta assured that his command will remain resolute to free its areas of operations from all forms of illegal oil theft and other activities and commended all government agencies that support its operations.

Receiving the suspects, the Commander of Warri Anti-Vandal Patrol of the NSCDC Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Abdullahi Murtala, said the Corps will carry out further investigations and possible prosecution of the suspects.

County,"If you're planning a road trip during spring break, you might want to plan for extra fuel costs.

The average price for a gallon of regular gas climbed to $5.02 in Los Angeles County on Saturday, an increase of roughly 23 cents compared to February, according to AAA. The average price of a gallon in L.A. County is about 4 cents higher than California's statewide average.

This is the first time since late November 2023 that the average price of a gallon of fuel has topped the $5 mark in L.A. County.

The trend in the county is on pace with what is happening across the country. The cost of regular gas is also up nationally, with the price per gallon increasing by approximately 27 cents to $3.53 a gallon since February.

Residents of California typically pay some of the highest gas prices in the country due to taxes. The average cost is roughly 81 cents in combined state and federal taxes per gallon in the state, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

Californians pay an average of $4.98 per gallon, the highest in the country. Hawaii is second at $4.70, while Washington is third at $4.41. Colorado has the cheapest average price at $3.07 per gallon. Residents in Missouri pay $3.09, while Texas is the third-lowest average at $3.17, according to AAA.

Other factors are also impacting the prices at the pump. A stubborn inflation rate continues to impact consumers. The U.S. Department of Labor says consumer prices rose by 0.4% from January to February. This affects the price of gas, food, energy, and airline prices, among other things.

The transition from winter to spring also plays a role in prices at the pump. With many children on spring break from school, more families are traveling.

""We're entering Spring Break season, and historically, March and April bring higher gas prices as demand rises,"" said Aixa Diaz, AAA spokesperson. ""With milder temperatures come more road trips, and this time of year tends to be a precursor to the summer driving season.""

Rosenqvist, just a few weeks into a debut at his new home at Meyer Shank Racing, again flashed top-level speed in his No. 60 Honda, following a front-row start two weeks ago in the 2024 season-opener at St. Pete. And unlike St. Pete, he finished on the right side of an uber-tight qualifying run - edging Team Penske's Scott McLaughlin for a pole in the first of two 10-lap heat races.

""It was a tricky day, man, but we kinda nailed it,"" Rosenqvist said, after his lap of 1:38.5831 that left him less than two hundredths of a second ahead of the Penske driver for the heat race pole. ""I did my lap at, like 99.5%. I didn't over-push anywhere, and I think that was the right strategy. You see so many people making mistakes. And if you get the gust of wind in the wrong place, you can end up in the wall.

""If I would have had done one little mistake, I would have been like (6) in my group. It's a very thin line from sitting here and scratching your head back in the truck.""

A juggernaut of a first group, where drivers had just eight minutes and one or two opportunities to lay down an optimal lap, finished with three drivers outside IndyCar's presumed top-4 teams starting in the front two rows for Sunday's first Group 1 heat. The somewhat surprising finishing order now sets the stage for what is expected to be a pair of energy-packed pair of 10-lap sprint races, without concern for fuel saving or much tire management.

Answers to your questions: Here's how IndyCar's $1 Million Challenge works

Trailing Rosenqvist and McLaughlin in the opening heat race Sunday will be Rinus VeeKay (Ed Carpenter Racing) and Christian Lundgaard (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing), followed by the Penske pair of Josef Newgarden and Will Power. The Juncos Hollinger Racing tandem of Romain Grosjean and Agustin Canapino will start on the 4 row for the Group 1 heat, with Scott Dixon, Santino Ferrucci, Colton Herta, Nolan Siegel, Kyle Kirkwood and Sting Ray Robb completing the lineup.

""The adrenaline is definitely higher when you're starting that lap, like, 'Okay, this is one-and-done',"" Rosenqvist said of the new-look qualifying format. ""Going into this, in a way, we're supposed to feel less pressure, being here because there's no points or anything, but I was actually more nervous than ever, probably. It felt really good just getting the lap done with such a tight field.""

Group 2's qualifying session brought the chaos a day early, as Andretti Global's Marcus Ericsson lost his rear tires while on a flying lap in Turn 8 of the 17-turn, 3.067 course inside the uber-exclusive, private gated community in the middle of the Coachella Valley desert. Unable to save his slide, Ericsson backed his No. 28 Honda into the tire barrier with 1:19 left in the session with Arrow McLaren's Callum Ilott and Pato O'Ward on top of the timing charts and an inexperienced trio of Pietro Fittipaldi, Colin Braun and Christian Rasmussen immediately trailing.

After Ericsson's car was towed off the track, race control restarted the session, giving those who wished one more shot to roll out of the pits and take a stab at a final flying lap. Having burned their push-to-pass boost and turned their optimal lap early in the session, Arrow McLaren held Ilott and O'Ward in the pits while most of the rest of the group made a final run.

The teammates plummeted in consequence to the 8th and 9th starting spots in their group, respectively, just behind fellow Arrow McLaren teammate Alexander Rossi, whose final lap sent him from 11th to 7th for the Group 2 heat.

Insider: IndyCar needs success with $1 Million Challenge

Like he did most of the nine hours of testing, Palou rocketed to the top in the closing minutes, followed closely by his Chip Ganassi Racing teammates in 2nd (Marcus Armstrong) and 4th (Linus Lundqvist). Graham Rahal took advantage of his final post-red lap to leap from 13th to 3rd. Rosenqvist's rookie MSR teammate Tom Blomqvist had a similarly-impressive day and will start 5th for his heat, with RLL's Fittipaldi in 6th. Kyffin Simpson (10th), Rasmussen (11th), Braun (12th) and Ericsson (13th) will bring up the rear, needing to force the issue quickly if they hope to advance to Sunday's finale.

""I'm going to put a bumper on the rear (of my car), because it's going to be tight. With the push-to-pass enabled on the start, and the tow (of the trailing cars), it's going to be tight,"" Palou said of his ensuing heat race. ""Nobody's safe. It's obviously the best spot - like, I wouldn't change it at all. But it's not guaranteed.

'I don't give a (expletive)': IndyCar drivers predict $1 Million Challenge battles to be 'chaotic'

""There's other races where you say, 'Okay, if you're through Turn 1, it's guaranteed you're going to be pretty much in the top-3 or top-5.' Here, I don't think that's the case. Hopefully we can get a good start and defend a little bit in Turn 1. I'll see what Felix does (in the previous heat) and I'll follow, or just do the complete opposite, depending on how he goes.""

The top-6 finishers in both heats will advance to a 20-lap main event, alternating starting spots between groups, with a $500,000 grand-prize, instead of points, on the line for Sunday's overall victor. Sunday's heat races begin at 12:30 pm.

The officials said miners were identified as Johar Khan Ishaqzai, Shah Khan and Bacha Khan Yousafzai and two of them belonged to Shangla area of Swat while the third one hailed from Quetta.

A heavy contingent of Levies Force and personnel of other law enforcement agencies rushed to the site and challenged the armed men. However, in an ensuing exchange of fire, the kidnappers managed to flee along with the coal miners.

While no one claimed responsibility, officials believed the armed men belonged to a banned outfit and kidnapped the miners for ransom.

Protest in Quetta

Protesters demand compensation for Harnai blast victims

On Saturday, hundreds of coal mine workers staged a sit-in to press the authorities to ensure safety and protection of miners in Balochistan, after the kidnapping of miners in Duki area and the methane gas explosion that claimed 12 lives in the Zardalo area of Harnai.

The protesters chanted slogans against the mine owners, directorate and other relevant authorities.

Led by Pakistan Workers' Federation, Balochistan chapter, Secretary General Pir Mohammad Kakar, the protesting coal mine workers gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club before taking out a rally carrying placards and banners inscribed with their demands.

Besides Mr Kakar, labour leaders Karim Harper, Malik Saeed Lehri and Usman Ali while addressing the protesters condemned the abduction.

According to them, over 60 coal miners have lost their lives in different incidents in Balochistan during the last two months. The three miners were kidnapped only three days after the methane explosion that claimed 12 lives of mine workers, they said, while deploring the indifference of the mines directorate and other relevant authorities towards the safety and protection of coal miners.

Mr Kakar demanded that each victim of the recent Harnai explosion be paid Rs2.5m compensation.

The Executive Order is primarily intended to catalyse the attraction of investments, reduce project costs, and shorten the contracting cycle in the oil and gas industry with the ultimate goal of increasing the production of hydrocarbon resources, revenue generation, and job creation.

The Executive Order fundamentally relates to tax incentives exemption, remission, and other incentives for the development, production, processing, and consumption of non-associated gas (NAG) in the country.

President of the group, Mrs Eyono Fatayi-Williams, said in a statement that the new presidential executive order comes with the long-required incentives for unlocking oilfield development investments in the nation's petroleum sector.

The order which also provides fiscal and commercial incentives for investments in the midstream petroleum industry would be the first set of spurs on commercial players in the industry in the past 20 years.

The WIEN boss said with the incentives hosted in the executive order, it was expected that some of Nigeria's discovered gas fields would now begin to see development and production investments.

""The incentives provided by Mr President will trigger a full chain activity in the petroleum industry, commercialize the nation's huge natural gas resources, and guarantee supply sufficiency for commercial, industrial, and domestic application of fuel gas in the economy,"" Fatayi-Williams said.

She pointed out that the incentives which include 10-year tax credits and allowances have made the executive order one of the strongest propellers of gas-driven industrial catalysts in the economy.

She added that unlocking the development of non-associated gas in Nigeria would assist players in the midstream and downstream petroleum industry to drive home some of the nation's economic aspirations for the gas industry, including the autogas policy, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration programme, national gas expansion programme and gas-to-power programme.

According to the WIEN President, the Executive Order would not only enable the much-needed investments in the upstream petroleum industry but also enhance ease of doing business by providing fiscally-congenial space for the inflow of investment capital into the nation's oil and gas sector.

With the investment incentives now thrown at the industry, Fatai-Williams called on all WIEN members to seize advantage of the tax credits and allowances to launch into the field with full female energy to support realisation of the goals of the unfolding reforms in the energy industry.

Fatayi-Williams pointed out that the incentives would spur full value chain activity in the industry where most members of WIEN have already taken active positions.

She noted that apart from being the most reliable industrial fuel and the cleanest available domestic fuel, natural gas holds enormous potential to restore complete commerciality in the electricity supply industry.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.388235294117647,448946864,26,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Women-in-Energy-Network.jpg,

Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.05882352941176472,448946691,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108743101,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-252348,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-9418993

PALAKKAD : The 'spirit' is waning as the mercury rises. Daily toddy production in Palakkad's Chittur -- the toddy hub of the state -- is plummeting. A coconut palm that used to generate an average of 2 to 2.5 litres of toddy daily is now yielding just 1-1.5 litres, say tappers, who attribute the sharp decline to the heatwave conditions prevailing in the state.

""From the nearly 30-odd litres that we got from 12 trees daily, output has dropped to around 18-20 litres. The decline will be severe by mid-April, when production can slip to half as litre per tree. Since our farm is located close to the river, it won't affect us in a big way, but there are large numbers of farms where water scarcity is a big issue. Production in these areas will come to a grinding halt during the summer,"" says G Marimuthu, a tapper who was also president of Perumatty grama panchayat in 2015.

After hovering around 39 degrees Celsius over the last several days, the mercury touched 41°C in Palakkad on Thursday.

The excise department permit allows for transportation of 2.05 lakh litres of toddy daily from Chittur. However, only an average of 1.4 lakh litres have passed through the checkpoints at Parali and Alathur every day in the last week.

""Shortage of toddy is an issue during peak summer. This is now very visible. In areas such as Meenakshipuram and Kollengode, shops are facing a shortage. We used to sell nearly 80 litres of coconut toddy every day at each of our shops, but we now get just around 60 litres from tappers,"" says Premam V V, a manager of five toddy shops in Alathur.

Some shop licensees add that demand for toddy is declining due to the availability of foreign liquor and synthetic drugs. According to Madhu C, district secretary of the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, one of the largest trade union federations in the country, foreign liquor has hurt the demand for toddy. ""Some of the licensees have a permit for 1,300 litres daily, but they are now only able to sell around 800 litres. Moreover, youngsters are shunning toddy shops. Only the elderly still consume toddy from shops.

Russia's oil infrastructure took another hit as drones targeted refineries in the Samara region.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery narrowly escaped damage, while the Kuibyshev refinery suffered a fire in one of its refining columns, Gov. Dmitry Azarov said.

The US has urged Ukraine to halt these attacks, according to The Financial Times, due to concerns over potential oil price increases and retaliation from Russia.

Responders managed to contain the blaze in Samara, averting a potential disaster at the facility, which boasts an annual oil processing capacity of 7 million tons, it was reported.

The targeted refineries, both part of Rosneft PJSC's Samara region group, play a crucial role in Russia's oil production landscape.

Footage distributed on social media claimed to show a Russian refinery ablaze in Samara last night. Business Insider was not able to verify its origins.

Ukraine's drone strikes on Russia's oil industry have inflicted significant damage, reducing processing capacity by 10%, said a

British defense intelligence update on Saturday.

""These strikes are imposing a financial cost on Russia, impacting the domestic fuel market. Depending on the extent of the damage, major repairs could take considerable time and expense. Sanctions are highly likely increasing the time and cost of sourcing replacement equipment,"" said the UK Ministry of Defence.

The strikes have targeted refineries, storage depots, and other key sites, exacerbating economic pain and raising fears of further escalation.

Another US concern at Ukraine's degrading of Russia's energy infrastructure, the FT said, is that Russia could retaliate by targeting energy infrastructure the West relies on, such as the CPC pipeline that transports oil from Kazakhstan to global markets.

According to Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna, officials in Kyiv believe that the refineries are ""absolutely legitimate targets from a military point of view.""

""We understand the calls of our American partners,"" she said. ""At the same time, we are fighting with the capabilities, resources, and practices that we have.""

It's not the first time the Biden administration has attempted to rein in Kyiv over its war strategy.

It previously warned Ukraine against using US-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.

Ukraine got around this ban by developing its own weapons that could strike inside Russia. Indeed, the refineries targeted in the Samara oblast last night are over 800 miles from Kyiv.

On Thursday, Russia retaliated against Ukraine's energy hubs, including the country's largest dam, with a wave of missiles and drones that left a million people without power.

Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Russia wanted to provoke ""a large-scale failure of the country's energy system,"" per BBC News.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

Indian oil refiners -- Moscow's second-biggest customers after China since the 2022 invasion -- will no longer accept tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot PJSC because of the risk posed by sanctions.

Since the start of October, the US has ratcheted up sanctions on the wider fleet of tankers moving Russian crude oil. Dozens of those targeted have been languishing ever since, and more barrels of Russian diesel are floating idly on the oceans than at any time since 2017, according to analytics firm Kpler.

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterized by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards $90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a grueling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

""It's a growing squeeze on Russian export flows, particularly to India,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. ""We're at the stage where sanctions-related friction is becoming very evident.""

Since October, the US has designated 40 individual Russian oil tankers. Four of the more recently targeted ones are continuing to make deliveries, but no sanctioned ship has collected a cargo since being named by the US Treasury, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Now, an increasingly tough trading environment has delivered a powerful symbolic blow to the Kremlin as India -- a stalwart commercial ally throughout war -- shuns its fleet. At the same time, Ukraine has started blowing up Russian oil refineries, though it's not clear how much support for the strategy it enjoys in Washington.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and on exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. ""It comes at a time when the US is struggling to send more aid to Ukraine, when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline, and when Russia appears to be gaining the upper hand.""

State-run Sovcomflot transported about a fifth of all Russia's crude deliveries to India last year. The figure appeared to be in decline even before the news that nation's refineries would no longer accept the ships.

""We expect and welcome that global oil buyers will be much less willing to deal with Sovcomflot than in the past,"" a US Treasury spokesperson said, adding that the measures should have no oil market impact because Russia will maintain an incentive to sell oil.""

Now that fleet will need to find work elsewhere -- and there are signs it's struggling. At least seven of the vessels have come to a halt in the Black Sea and disappeared from digital monitoring systems, tanker tracking by Bloomberg shows. Sovcomflot admitted this week that sanctions had hurt its operations.

""The targeting of Sovcomflot represents a significant tightening of US sanctions against Russia,"" said Janis Kluge, senior associate for Eastern Europe and Eurasia at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ""It will not solve the problem of circumvention, but it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

Even so, Russia can still draw on a so-called ""shadow fleet"" of vessels amassed shortly after the 2022 invasion -- often older ships without proper insurance and with unclear ownership -- to make its deliveries. By some estimates, there are as many as 600 such carriers in operation, alongside Greek tankers that continue to serve the trade under the G-7 price cap.

Delivery costs for Russian oil are huge. It costs about $14.50 a barrel to delivery a Baltic Sea cargo to China, according to data from Argus Media. Well over half that sum is attributable to sanctions, it estimates.

""Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts,"" said Bronze at Energy Aspects.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to March 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Kluge.",ajot.com,news,American Journal of Transportation | AJOT | 1-800-599-6358,,-0.3333333333333334,448945721,1,https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Russian_diesel_chart.jpg,ukr-235913

The Buckner Volunteer Fire Department responded to reports of a pungent odor around North Mcdyby Street at 6:50 p.m. Officials arrived on the scene and confirmed the smell appeared to be ammonia.

Buckner officials called on the Christopher, Coello and Benton fire departments to aid in the situation.

Investigators say a farm area on the northern half of State Route 14 utilized Anhydrous Ammonia nurse tanks. While the tanks had left the scene by this point, investigators believe the gas had already leaked out. Officials noted a thick presence of the gas in the zone and spreading across to homes across the road.

Officials scoured the surrounding areas until the tanks were discovered and the leaks confirmed. Investigators closed the leak and turned off the tanks.

The Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) has issued a 24-hour forecast indicating that a low-pressure system, stemming from the prevailing heat, is covering the upper parts of the country. This system is expected to bring very hot weather and isolated thunderstorms throughout the day. The general public is advised to take precautions and look after their health due to the extreme heat.

The southern and southeast winds are carrying moisture from the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea to the lower northeastern, lower central, and eastern regions of Thailand. This influx of moisture could lead to thunderstorms in some areas. People in the upper parts of Thailand are urged to be cautious of the potential dangers posed by these thunderstorms during this period.

In the seas, the east and southeast winds are affecting the Gulf of Thailand, the southern region, and the Andaman Sea. These conditions are expected to lead to thunderstorms in some areas of the south, with wave heights in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea reaching about 1 metre. In areas experiencing thunderstorms, waves could exceed 1 metre. Fishermen are advised to avoid sailing in these conditions.

Additionally, the upper northern parts, the lower northeastern region, the central region, including Bangkok and its vicinity, and the eastern region, continue to experience moderate to high levels of dust particles/smog. This is due to weakening winds in these areas and poor air circulation.

The weather forecast for Thailand from 6am today to 6am tomorrow predicts hot weather with patchy clouds in the daytime for the northern region, with minimum temperatures ranging from 17 to 25 degrees Celsius and maximum temperatures hitting 36 to 40 degrees Celsius. Southwest winds are expected to travel at speeds of 5 to 15 kilometres per hour.

In the lower northeastern region, hot weather with patchy clouds during the day is anticipated, along with a 10% chance of thunderstorms in areas including Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Kalasin, Mukdahan, Yasothon, Amnat Charoen, and Ubon Ratchathani. Minimum temperatures are forecast to be 22 to 25 degrees Celsius with maximums of 36 to 38 degrees Celsius and southwest winds at 10 to 15 kilometres per hour.

Temperature rises

The central region is also set to experience very hot weather, with light rain in some lower parts. Minimum temperatures are expected to be 24 to 26 degrees Celsius, with maximums reaching 37 to 40 degrees Celsius, and southern winds at 10 to 15 kilometres per hour.

In the eastern region, hot weather with patchy clouds during the day is forecast for the upper parts, with a 20% chance of thunderstorms, particularly in Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Trat. Minimum temperatures could be 24 to 26 degrees Celsius, with maximums of 33 to 37 degrees Celsius, and southerly winds at speeds of 10 to 30 kilometres per hour. Sea waves are expected to be less than 1 metre high but could exceed 1 metre in stormy areas.

For the southern region (east coast), hot daytime weather with a 10% chance of thunderstorms is predicted, mainly affecting Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, and Nakhon Si Thammarat. Minimum temperatures may range from 23 to 25 degrees Celsius, with highs of 33 to 38 degrees Celsius, and southeast winds at 15 to 30 kilometres per hour. Sea waves are likely to be about 1 metre high, with higher waves in stormy areas.

In the southern region (west coast), hot daytime weather with light rain in some places is expected. Minimum temperatures could be 24 to 26 degrees Celsius, with maximums of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius, and easterly winds at 15 to 30 kilometres per hour. Sea waves are anticipated to be about 1 metre high, with higher waves in stormy areas further from the coast, reported KhaoSod.

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

There's a lot going on out here in the desert.

For instance, it's called the $1 Million Challenge even though the winner will only get a half million bucks. Hey, it's better marketing. The Challenge is being held at a very nice club racing track called The Thermal Club about 30 miles east of Palm Springs. Indycar held a test session here a year ago last February, and everything went so well that they're back again this year and decided to tack on a race after testing.

The track is so small and tight, and the surface so abrasive to tires, that officials decided to split everything up into two heat races Sunday morning. The top six finishers of those two heat races qualify for the main event after that. Saturday was qualifying for the heat races, and that's what Palou and Rosenqvist each won.

It wasn't easy.

With a rainstorm pelting the greater Southern California area a hundred miles to the west, that meant lots of wind blasting into the Palm Springs area. With wind in the desert, you get sand picked up. With sand comes something out of an old Hollywood Bible movie - think the Ten Commandments, Exodus, or Lawrence of Arabia.

""We were getting blasted by what appeared to be a giant haboob in the golf cart,"" said commentator and former racer Townsend Bell, referring to the desert wind named for the Arabic word for ""blasting"" or ""drifting.""

""It's so wind-dependent,"" said Graham Rahal of the track conditions. Rahal qualified third in the second group. ""Wind on the side of the car is terrible, but then getting the power down in all the hairpins is awful.""

""It's so tricky out there, man,"" said Rosenqvist. ""The wind is changing, there's dust on the track.""

""One thing about this track, with basically a sandstorm that just came through, every outing the car felt different,"" said Rinus Veekay, who qualified third in the first session. ""We just kind of nailed it.""

So then what's the key to winning this event?

""Stay on the track,"" he said. ""You only gotta lead one lap that's the last one.""

Crazy desert weather dominated qualifying for the Indycar NTT $1 Million Challenge in California, as Felix Rosenqvist and Alex Palou each topped their respective qualifying sessions for Sunday's two heat races.

There's a lot going on out here in the desert.

For instance, it's called the $1 Million Challenge even though the winner will only get a half million bucks. Hey, it's better marketing. The Challenge is being held at a very nice club racing track called The Thermal Club about 30 miles east of Palm Springs. Indycar held a test session here a year ago last February, and everything went so well that they're back again this year and decided to tack on a race after testing.

The track is so small and tight, and the surface so abrasive to tires, that officials decided to split everything up into two heat races Sunday morning. The top six finishers of those two heat races qualify for the main event after that. Saturday was qualifying for the heat races, and that's what Palou and Rosenqvist each won.

It wasn't easy.

With a rainstorm pelting the greater Southern California area a hundred miles to the west, that meant lots of wind blasting into the Palm Springs area. With wind in the desert, you get sand picked up. With sand comes something out of an old Hollywood Bible movie - think the Ten Commandments, Exodus, or Lawrence of Arabia.

""We were getting blasted by what appeared to be a giant haboob in the golf cart,"" said commentator and former racer Townsend Bell, referring to the desert wind named for the Arabic word for ""blasting"" or ""drifting.""

""It's so wind-dependent,"" said Graham Rahal of the track conditions. Rahal qualified third in the second group. ""Wind on the side of the car is terrible, but then getting the power down in all the hairpins is awful.""

""It's so tricky out there, man,"" said Rosenqvist. ""The wind is changing, there's dust on the track.""

""One thing about this track, with basically a sandstorm that just came through, every outing the car felt different,"" said Rinus Veekay, who qualified third in the first session. ""We just kind of nailed it.""

So then what's the key to winning this event?

""Stay on the track,"" he said. ""You only gotta lead one lap that's the last one.""

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security. | Reuters

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto retained the figure skating world title with a stellar performance in Montreal on Friday and became the first woman to win three straight crowns since American Peggy Fleming in 1968.

Sakamoto was in fourth place after the short program, but the 23-year-old's dazzling free skate to Wild Is The Wind/Feeling Good by Lauryn Hill helped her match 1968 Olympic champion Fleming, who won three world titles between 1966-68.

Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Sakamoto's run began with a double axel and a triple Lutz, before a series of intricate combination jumps brought thunderous applause from the crowd at the Bell Centre.

""I was fourth in the short program, so I was a little anxious about that, but today I was in a really good place emotionally,"" said Sakamoto, who finished with 222.96 points. ""I was able to calm down today. I was able to keep focused and do my elements one after the other and I am happy with this result.""

American Isabeau Levito, a world junior champion in 2022, won silver with a score of 212.16 while Kim Chae-yeon of South Korea took bronze with 203.59.

Earlier on Friday, veteran ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates scored a 90.08 for their rhythm dance routine at the world championships, putting the Americans on the cusp of a second consecutive world title.

Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri were in second after notching a 87.52, and home favourites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada held third with 86.51 ahead of Saturday's free dance.

Performing to music by Queen, Chock and Bates drew roars from the crowd for their smooth twizzle sequence, closing rotational lift and sassy attitude.

""We went out there, and I know it sounds cheesy, but to have the time of our lives,"" said Bates. ""We've been looking to a Montreal worlds for a long time. Being here for an 11th world championship, healthy and still enjoying it all, it's the greatest victory of all.""

Chock, 31, and Bates, 35, relocated to Montreal after a disappointing finish at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang.

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Data from Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi suggests that around 85% of traditional wine-growing regions will be unable to produce grapes suited for their traditional products by 2050, as reported by NPR.

""Wine is kind of the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture because so much of the character of wine is tied to the local climate,"" Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told the news outlet.

Champagne, which is made only in the region of France after which it is named, is one of the popular drinks expected to be in trouble.

Chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, the three types of grapes typically used in the blended sparkling wine, have all been affected by severe weather events, which have become more common as the result of an overheating planet. Flavor can be impacted as well.

""In a chardonnay grape, what you're looking for in a cooler climate is generally a taste that's apple or a little citrusy, whereas in a warmer climate the warmth can change the grapes qualities to be more like a tropical fruit, or even banana-like,"" ClimateAi head of wine and events Jasmine Spiess explained on NPR's Morning Edition.

Some grape growers in Champagne saw as much as 90% of their crops destroyed in April 2021 when temperatures suddenly dropped below freezing overnight, according to France Today, which pointed out that the trend of higher temperatures was likely to blame.

The outlet wrote that the ""historically cool northern climate"" has warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius (around 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 20 years, meaning that the vines were budding earlier than normal and moving up the harvest to earlier in the year.

Meanwhile, some new wine-growing regions are emerging, according to Spiess, who told NPR's Morning Edition that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden may have increasingly favorable conditions for producing wine.

Scientists at the University of Minnesota are among those who have been developing grapes to be more resilient to the effects of a changing climate, meaning some additional solutions could be around the corner.

However, transitioning away from dirty-energy fuels is still the best way to slow down rising temperatures driving the extreme weather, which contributed to the lowest level of wine production in 60 years in 2023, according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine.

""This is very much a now problem,"" ClimateAi vice president of operations and strategy Will Kletter told CNN in December. ""That means more expensive wine, or maybe the wine that's produced is not of the same quality, and maybe you can't even access some of the wines that you're used to enjoying. And that's a problem that we're facing today.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.05882352941176472,448943727,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1ABPp.Awz2foe4268te0OA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/8ac7a34dcb29cae54e306c4cb1bcc249,eng-9411766

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto retained the figure skating world title with a stellar performance in Montreal on Friday and became the first woman to win three straight crowns since American Peggy Fleming in 1968.

Sakamoto was in fourth place after the short program, but the 23-year-old's dazzling free skate to Wild Is The Wind/Feeling Good by Lauryn Hill helped her match 1968 Olympic champion Fleming, who won three world titles between 1966-68.

Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Sakamoto's run began with a double axel and a triple Lutz, before a series of intricate combination jumps brought thunderous applause from the crowd at the Bell Centre.

""I was fourth in the short program, so I was a little anxious about that, but today I was in a really good place emotionally,"" said Sakamoto, who finished with 222.96 points. ""I was able to calm down today. I was able to keep focused and do my elements one after the other and I am happy with this result.""

American Isabeau Levito, a world junior champion in 2022, won silver with a score of 212.16 while Kim Chae-yeon of South Korea took bronze with 203.59.

Earlier on Friday, veteran ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates scored a 90.08 for their rhythm dance routine at the world championships, putting the Americans on the cusp of a second consecutive world title.

Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri were in second after notching a 87.52, and home favourites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada held third with 86.51 ahead of Saturday's free dance.

Performing to music by Queen, Chock and Bates drew roars from the crowd for their smooth twizzle sequence, closing rotational lift and sassy attitude.

""We went out there, and I know it sounds cheesy, but to have the time of our lives,"" said Bates. ""We've been looking to a Montreal worlds for a long time. Being here for an 11th world championship, healthy and still enjoying it all, it's the greatest victory of all.""

Chock, 31, and Bates, 35, relocated to Montreal after a disappointing finish at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang.

The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Oljas Bektenov has held a meeting with the Executive Vice President of Shell, Peter Costello, to discuss the status of their collaborative projects in the oil and gas industry, Trend reports.

Therefore, maintaining oil and condensate output at a level of at least 11 million tons annually is the top objective, according to the Karachaganak expansion project. In order to do this, the involved parties will guarantee the prompt commissioning of extra compressors for raw gas reinjection.

Concurrently, the question of building a 4 billion cubic meter per year gas processing plant in Karachaganak at the expense of the shareholders is being discussed in order to guarantee the project's complete operation.

Furthermore, particular focus was placed on the Kashagan field's consistent operation. Production of gas reached 11.86 billion m3 and oil 18.77 million tons in the last year. 5.83 billion m3 of gas were reinjected into the reservoir. The question of constructing a gas processing facility in Kashagan is in the development stage in order to fully exploit the field.

Oljas Bektenov emphasized the importance of incorporating more Kazakh content into projects, especially by relocating production facilities.

""Today, the proportion of local content in project operators' labor is adequate; nevertheless, the proportion of local content in products purchases is still quite low. This necessitates more communication with regional producers who are interested in making goods,"" he stated.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Rosenqvist, just a few weeks into a debut at his new home at Meyer Shank Racing, again flashed top-level speed in his No. 60 Honda, following a front-row start two weeks ago in the 2024 season-opener at St. Pete. And unlike St. Pete, he finished on the right side of an uber-tight qualifying run - edging Team Penske's Scott McLaughlin for a pole in the first of two 10-lap heat races.

""It was a tricky day, man, but we kinda nailed it,"" Rosenqvist said, after his lap of 1:38.5831 that left him less than two hundredths of a second ahead of the Penske driver for the heat race pole. ""I did my lap at, like 99.5%. I didn't over-push anywhere, and I think that was the right strategy. You see so many people making mistakes. And if you get the gust of wind in the wrong place, you can end up in the wall.

""If I would have had done one little mistake, I would have been like (6) in my group. It's a very thin line from sitting here and scratching your head back in the truck.""

A juggernaut of a first group, where drivers had just eight minutes and one or two opportunities to lay down an optimal lap, finished with three drivers outside IndyCar's presumed top-4 teams starting in the front two rows for Sunday's first Group 1 heat. The somewhat surprising finishing order now sets the stage for what is expected to be a pair of energy-packed pair of 10-lap sprint races, without concern for fuel saving or much tire management.

Answers to your questions: Here's how IndyCar's $1 Million Challenge works

Trailing Rosenqvist and McLaughlin in the opening heat race Sunday will be Rinus VeeKay (Ed Carpenter Racing) and Christian Lundgaard (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing), followed by the Penske pair of Josef Newgarden and Will Power. The Juncos Hollinger Racing tandem of Romain Grosjean and Agustin Canapino will start on the 4 row for the Group 1 heat, with Scott Dixon, Santino Ferrucci, Colton Herta, Nolan Siegel, Kyle Kirkwood and Sting Ray Robb completing the lineup.

""The adrenaline is definitely higher when you're starting that lap, like, 'Okay, this is one-and-done',"" Rosenqvist said of the new-look qualifying format. ""Going into this, in a way, we're supposed to feel less pressure, being here because there's no points or anything, but I was actually more nervous than ever, probably. It felt really good just getting the lap done with such a tight field.""

Group 2's qualifying session brought the chaos a day early, as Andretti Global's Marcus Ericsson lost his rear tires while on a flying lap in Turn 8 of the 17-turn, 3.067 course inside the uber-exclusive, private gated community in the middle of the Coachella Valley desert. Unable to save his slide, Ericsson backed his No. 28 Honda into the tire barrier with 1:19 left in the session with Arrow McLaren's Callum Ilott and Pato O'Ward on top of the timing charts and an inexperienced trio of Pietro Fittipaldi, Colin Braun and Christian Rasmussen immediately trailing.

After Ericsson's car was towed off the track, race control restarted the session, giving those who wished one more shot to roll out of the pits and take a stab at a final flying lap. Having burned their push-to-pass boost and turned their optimal lap early in the session, Arrow McLaren held Ilott and O'Ward in the pits while most of the rest of the group made a final run.

The teammates plummeted in consequence to the 8th and 9th starting spots in their group, respectively, just behind fellow Arrow McLaren teammate Alexander Rossi, whose final lap sent him from 11th to 7th for the Group 2 heat.

Insider: IndyCar needs success with $1 Million Challenge

Like he did most of the nine hours of testing, Palou rocketed to the top in the closing minutes, followed closely by his Chip Ganassi Racing teammates in 2nd (Marcus Armstrong) and 4th (Linus Lundqvist). Graham Rahal took advantage of his final post-red lap to leap from 13th to 3rd. Rosenqvist's rookie MSR teammate Tom Blomqvist had a similarly-impressive day and will start 5th for his heat, with RLL's Fittipaldi in 6th. Kyffin Simpson (10th), Rasmussen (11th), Braun (12th) and Ericsson (13th) will bring up the rear, needing to force the issue quickly if they hope to advance to Sunday's finale.

""I'm going to put a bumper on the rear (of my car), because it's going to be tight. With the push-to-pass enabled on the start, and the tow (of the trailing cars), it's going to be tight,"" Palou said of his ensuing heat race. ""Nobody's safe. It's obviously the best spot - like, I wouldn't change it at all. But it's not guaranteed.

'I don't give a (expletive)': IndyCar drivers predict $1 Million Challenge battles to be 'chaotic'

""There's other races where you say, 'Okay, if you're through Turn 1, it's guaranteed you're going to be pretty much in the top-3 or top-5.' Here, I don't think that's the case. Hopefully we can get a good start and defend a little bit in Turn 1. I'll see what Felix does (in the previous heat) and I'll follow, or just do the complete opposite, depending on how he goes.""

The top-6 finishers in both heats will advance to a 20-lap main event, alternating starting spots between groups, with a $500,000 grand-prize, instead of points, on the line for Sunday's overall victor. Sunday's heat races begin at 12:30 pm.

Overall, the Cavs are 7-10 exiting the All-Star break and are 6-9 without Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland's best player, who has been dealing with a bothersome knee injury. Despite being undergunned without Mitchell available, the offense still averages 107.3 points per game since exiting the All-Star break, the eighteenth-best in the NBA.

More worryingly, while Cleveland has only scored more than 100 points 14 times in this 17-game post-All-Star break stretch, their defense has failed to contain the opposition - allowing 109.8 points per game, which is also the eighteenth-best in the NBA. While that 2.5-point differential doesn't seem like much, having only the eighteenth-best offense and the eighteenth-best defense isn't a recipe for success, especially if you're the Cavs who pride themselves on defense.

Evan Mobley to the Cavs' rescue?

Thankfully, Cleveland might get a major boost on defense against the Miami Heat with Evan Mobley possibly returning to action. Mobley has been sidelined for ten games after suffering a nasty ankle sprain in Cleveland's 105-104 home win over the Boston Celtics. But, against the Heat, Mobley is listed as questionable and will likely be a game-time decision, possibly giving the Cavs a major defensive boost.

Whether or not he plays will ultimately hinge on how Mobley's ankle responds to the teams' morning shootaround in South Beach and Cleveland's usual pre-game warmup. If everything feels good and he gets clearance from the Cavs' medical staff, Mobley will get the green light to play and likely draw the start, even if it's on a possible minute restriction.

While Mobley might not be able to give Cleveland an offensive boost for a Cavs squad still without Mitchell (knee), Max Strus (knee), Dean Wade (knee), Ty Jerome (ankle), Pete Nance (NBA G League assignment) and Isaiah Mobley (NBA G League assignment), he'll again help close the gap and force the Cavs to throw their weight around on the defensive side of the ball.

In their past matchups with Miami, Cleveland head coach J.B. Bickerstaff has empowered Mobley to match Heat superstar Jimmy Butler minute for minute on defense, making the Cavs nearly impossible to score against. Sure, Mobley is more than comfortable defending Butler one-on-one and grades out as one of the NBA's better perimeter defenders. He's also comfortable switching into the interior, walling off the paint alongside Cleveland big man Jarrett Allen. But that's obvious for Mobley whenever he suits up for the Cavs.

Instead, most importantly when it comes to this matchup, Mobley is empowered to play free safety in Cleveland's defense. He can read and react to how the Heat are playing on offense, paying close attention to Butler while Miami grinds to find a bucket. With how sound Mobley is defensively, it leads to easy turnovers forced by the Cavs and even easier fast-break buckets on the other end of the floor. For whatever reason Mobley seems to be the Heat's kryptonite and, as long as he's with Cleveland, the Cavs will keep exploiting that advantage.

Granted, if Mobley does play, he won't be at 100% since he's missed ten games. There's bound to be rust on either end of the floor, and if he's under a minute restriction, it'll be hard to fully understand where his game is currently this season. Regardless, Mobley returning to the fold with nearly ten games left in the regular season is huge for a Cavs team that wants to make some noise in the playoffs - especially if they draw the Heat in the first round. This game can serve as another test for Cleveland on pressure points they can hit against Miami and, if they do collide in the postseason, makes the matchup more favorable for Mobley and the Cavs on defense.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Evan Dammarell,0.1764705882352942,448942927,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The_Cavs_could_get_a_major_defensive_boost_if_Evan_Mobley_returns_to_action_against_the_Heat.jpg,

UVA Women Win their 4th Consecutive NCAA Division I Championship,"In spite of losing one of the greatest college swimmers in history Kate Douglass, the Virginia women were still about as good as last year's team en route to their 4th-consecutive NCAA Team Championship. The Cavaliers scored 527.5 points, 14 fewer than last season.

They did that on the strength of the Walsh sisters, including the younger Gretchen who had one of the great NCAA Championship meets ever with 3 individual wins and 3 all-time Records. That included a staggering 47.42 in the 100 fly when only five women have even been 48, and a 44.83 in the 100 free when only four women have even been 45.

But they also showed some new facets - like a breakout meet for transfer Jasmine Nocentini, who became a star at this meet by winning the 100 breaststroke in 56.09, and swimming some of the best sprint free times ever. Her 50 free time of 21.10 for 3rd place makes her the 7th-best performer ever in that event, and she also placed 4th in the 100 free in 47.00. She was a good swimmer, an All-American, before transferring to Virginia, but at this meet she became a bona fide star.

Nocentini swam two years at Florida International before transferring to Northwestern for the 2022-23 season. She ended her senior season at Northwestern early with a shoulder injury at a point when she was the top-ranked swimmer in the Big Ten in the 50 free and 100 breast. Her best 100 breast time coming into the 2023-24 season was 58.23; she won the 100 breast in Athens with 56.06, the 2nd-fastest performance in history.

Virginia also turned into a diving school, with Lizzy Kaye becoming the school's first diving All-American ever when she finished 10th on 3-meter, then becoming the school's first First Team All-American when she finished 8th on 3-meter. If Virginia can springboard themselves into a 30-point yearly diving program, the rest of the NCAA is in huge trouble.

There were a couple of key points in this meet where the Cavaliers aptly counterpunched areas that should have been dominant strengths for the Longhorns. Kaye was one of them. The other was in the 200 fly, where Virginia got two in the A-Final even with Alex Walsh opting to swim the 200 breast instead. Freshman Tess Howley, who hadn't been a best time since 2021, finished 4th, while Abby Harter finished 6th - both moving way up from their 16th (Harter) and 17th (Howley) seeds.

Texas still won diving (77-18) and the 200 fly (56-28), but Virginia's resilience in those events kept the Longhorns from the avalanches that they could have had.

Virginia sent a maximum roster of 18 athletes to NCAAs:

Special shoutout to Ella Bathurst, who qualified for NCAAs but was dropped to make room for Kaye.

With the women, Virginia matches Cal as the 5th-most NCAA Division I Women's Swimming & Diving titles in history. They also move into rare territory as only the third women's program in D1 history to four-peat, joining Stanford, who five-peated from 1992 through 1996, and Texas, who five-peated from 1984 through 1988.

On the men's side, only Texas (1988-1991, 2015-2018), Michigan (1937-1941), USC (1963-1966, 1974-1977), Auburn (2003-2007), and Indiana (1968-1973) have done it. noting that all but the Texas streaks happened before the NCAA hosted its first women's championship in 1982.

Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries

By Bloomberg News

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programmes to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbour, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a tonne, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70 per cent. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93 per cent of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tonnes, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilise through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21 per cent over the past three years to 4.7 billion tonnes. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tonnes for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",business-standard.com,news,Business Standard,,-0.02745098039215688,448942431,1,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-03/24/full/1711245683-216.jpg,eng-9418993

Click here for the first part.]

CEBU CITY, Philippines - The same analysis by Cebu Daily News Digital (CDN Digital) showed that even private schools, which usually have better facilities and smaller student populations than government-run schools, were affected by the heat last summer.

St. John Paul II Cognition School, a private school in Mandaue City, a highly urbanized metro in Cebu, has smaller student sizes than Leyte National High School in Tacloban City, Leyte. Yet, teachers and students there also complained of unbearable heat.

The school suspended in-person classes from April 24 to April 28 due to extreme heat - the first time the school did so. At the time, the heat index in Cebu reached dangerous levels, ranging from 38 to 40 degrees Celsius.

Since the majority of their students live nearby and just walk to and from school, Wilmonina Bering, the principal, said officials were worried that the children would get sick or, worse, hospitalized.

""When I see kids walking to the school with scorching heat outside, it pains me. I worry for them, especially their health,"" she said in Cebuano.

Children are the most vulnerable to heat, as studies show they have lesser capacity to regulate body temperature than adults. When kids are exposed to unbearable hot weather for long periods, they are likely to suffer from heat-related illnesses.

By 2050, around 33 million children in the Philippines will be exposed to heat waves due to global warming, according to projections from the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).

This means that less than 30 years from now, at least 8 out of 10 Filipino kids will suffer from high heat waves.

A 2021 study in the United States also found that heat adversely impacted learners in the U.S. and other countries and that poor and marginalized students are at a disadvantage.

By collating standard achievement test scores from 58 countries and 12,000 U.S. school districts, researchers discovered that the rate of learning declines when there's an increase in the number of hot school days.

No similar study has been done in the Philippines. But the group Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) planned to have one soon to get a closer look at how extreme heat affects learners and teachers, said their Rep. France Castro.

In Leyte National High School, teachers like Edsyl Colico expressed concerns over students who endure the hot and humid weather on empty stomachs, making their learning experience more burdensome.

""I feel for the children. Many of them do not have packed lunches or snacks. Some do not even eat well at home. And when they arrive in their classrooms, they have another problem to contend with: the heat,"" Colico said.

Even access to clean water is a challenge for these students.

""I keep reminding my students to hydrate, to take a bath if they have water at home. We cannot avoid the fact that some of them have limited to no access to running water every day. Some of them can shower only at night because that's the time they have water,"" Colico said.

Even without the heat issue, there are already clear learning disparities between students from affluent households and those from poorer families. Remote learning widened the gap.

Public school students do not have access to computers and the internet, which are necessary tools for remote learning, said Jose Ramon Albert, a senior research fellow at the think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS).

While many public schools implement the cheaper option of asynchronous remote learning using printed modules, experts said that real-time online learning is still the better option.

Remote learning also depends on the quality of support students get from their homes, as a 2020 PIDS study found that the latter has a strong correlation with test scores.

""Poor parents, especially mothers, have no time and no capacity to be co-facilitators of learning,"" Albert said in an interview. This is because many of them are not educated and need to be away from their children to work.

The lower quantity and quality of home support among poorer households is an obvious consideration for the disparity, said PIDS President Aniceto Orbeta Jr in his 2022 paper.

""One can also expect home conditions of more impoverished families to be less conducive to learning, and this becomes more critical when education happens at home,"" Orbeta said.

Some public schools also face a disproportionate number of healthcare workers to handle heat-related illnesses.

For example, Leyte National High School only has two nurses for their over 8,000 students. This meant that a single nurse was expected to handle at least 4,000 students.

When over a thousand students were rushed to the clinic last summer, nurses like Nancy Britannia had to work double time. At one point, she had to extend her shift up to 9 p.m. to make sure no student was left unattended in the clinic.

Britannia said their clinic needs more nurses, especially now that hotter summers are becoming the norm.

""We're really hoping for additional manpower in the clinic, more so that summer is coming again soon,"" she said.

Experts believe that the warmer temperatures experienced last year, as a result of climate change, will likely worsen the condition of poor children in the Philippines, according to a report from the non-profit organization Save the Children Philippines.

The group said 5.6 million poor Filipino families are exposed to risks and hazards from disasters, including tropical cyclones and heatwaves. It is projected that Filipino children born in 2020 will live in a world where there are nearly five times more scorching heat waves than today.

Decades-long education problems aggravate the dire situation

The extreme heat in the summer of 2023 worsened existing issues plaguing the Philippine education system. The country continues to struggle with poor quality of education, classroom congestion, and substandard facilities, among others.

A 2022 World Bank report on global learning poverty revealed that 9 in 10 Filipinos could not read and understand a simple text at ten years old. The school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic, among the longest in the world, exacerbated the problem.

The 2022 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results also indicated that Filipino students are five to six years behind in learning competencies. The Philippines ranked in the bottom 10 out of 81 countries in mathematics, science, and reading comprehension.

On top of this, there is a glaring shortage of teachers in public schools.

During the Senate budget deliberations late last year, it was revealed that nearly 90,000 teaching positions have yet to be filled by the Department of Education (DepEd). For the academic year 2023-2024, the agency planned to hire 9,650 teachers but it was able to fill only 35 percent.

The Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 admitted that the education infrastructure ""continues to grapple with inadequacies"" of classrooms, teachers, textbooks, facilities, and modern equipment.

When classes started last August 2023, DepEd recorded over 23 million enrollees, both in public and private schools. Public schools have a high teacher-to-student ratio, sometimes reaching one to 60 in highly congested schools in cities.

Based on the ACT survey, around 7 out of 10 teachers who complained of unbearable heat were handling large classes with over 40 students cramped inside a classroom.

In the case of Leyte National High School, where the average classroom size ranges from 40 to 45 students, some teachers took it upon themselves to address the heat problem. They even asked their students to bring fans and extra shirts.

When face-to-face classes were suspended for two weeks last summer in Leyte National High School, teachers tried little ways to improve ventilation, including replacing their existing thick curtains with thinner ones to help facilitate airflow.

Selected schools in Eastern Visayas also decided to simply implement shifting. On some days, a number of students would go to school, while the rest would do modular learning.

""The purpose was to decongest the classroom,"" said Jasmin Calzita, public information officer at DepEd Region 8. This meant that selected classes would be doing face-to-face classes in the morning while others would attend them in the afternoon, Calzita explained.

But four out of 10 of the teachers surveyed by ACT said nothing was done to address the dire situation in their schools. Majority of them reported having electric fans in their classrooms, but these are not enough, students and teachers complained.

""Even if we have electric fans, it's like the same thing as throwing back water to the sea... It does absolutely nothing because our environment is already hot,"" Anthony Egot, a senior high school student at Leyte National High School, said.

At one point last summer, Egot's academic performance slightly declined. He said his headaches, triggered by the hot and humid weather, kept on distracting him during classes.

""I guess that's one of the things that really affected my attention or my focus. And if I had the focus, I would have been more able to listen to my teacher's lessons,"" Egot said.

Reverting to the Old School Calendar is not the cure for all the ills

It is summer again, and the Philippines is about to enter a new school year this 2024. This time, though, the DepEd decided to reintroduce the old school calendar to protect teachers and students from the hazard of extreme heat.

After months of deliberation with various groups, the government decided to slowly return to the previous academic calendar, where classes start in June and end in March.

""The idea of having classes during the hottest months of the year is no longer favorable both for the teachers and students. It's also no longer favorable for the education sector,"" Benjo Basas, chairperson of Teachers Dignity Coalition (TDC), told CDN.

Some experts, however, pointed out that the government must do more to address climate change's impact on education.

""We cannot keep shifting our calendars as we try to keep up with climate change,"" Dr. Anna Cristina Tuazon, an Associate Professor at the Department of Psychology of the University of the Philippines Diliman, wrote for her column Safe Space in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

The Movement for Safe, Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education (SEQURE), a coalition of education experts, also said the government must allocate a higher budget for education to include disaster-resilient infrastructure, upgraded facilities, and a science-based climate change and climate justice curriculum.

More than this, the group said the government must stop ""all economic plunder that (will push) higher the risks of environmental destruction due to foreign and large scale economic activities in Philippine ecosystems.""

""The Philippine education system is just a microcosm of Philippine society. The government is not stopping climate risk projects that destroy forestand coastal ecosystems vital to managing climate change,"" SEQURE told CDN. ""It is the Filipinos who greatly faced the impacts of the current climate crisis.""

""The Philippine education sector is most affected by these disasters. Even if the Department of Education and other government agencies have climate change adaptations and mitigation programs, it will remain a band-aid solution and high risk and vulnerability of school children and education remain,"" the group added.

Bernie Lamograr, the Leyte National High School assistant principal, shared the same sentiment.

""There are leaders who do not believe in climate change but it's really here. Like we at the bottom really feel it. The government has to do something about this because it's affecting everyone. They only have short-term solutions, like giving ayuda or financial help. But it should be preventive and curative.""

In the meantime, students and teachers have to mostly fend for themselves again as they face a possibly even hotter summer in 2024. And as early as the first week of March this year, some schools started suspending face-to-face classes once more as the summer heat this year begins to bite again.

METHODOLOGY

Heat index data was acquired from the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), covering the period from January 2022 to July 2023.

Missing data due to technical errors at weather stations (encoded by Pagasa using the negative value -999) were excluded from our analysis. A complete list of the steps undertaken in scraping, cleaning, and analyzing the heat index data can be found on the Data Diary sheet of the DataDoc on Heat Index.

We also used rankings of the Heat-Health Risk Index (HHRI) from the study by Ronald Estoque, et. al, published in Nature Communications, which are available online.

Other datasets included in this story are the online survey by the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) in March 2023 about teaching experiences during hot and humid days.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

The rules still need to overcome opposition by another state agency.

They were approved Thursday by the board of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, despite a late objection from the state Department of Finance because of cost effects on the state, the Los Angeles Times reported.

There is no federal heat standard in the United States. California has had heat protection rules for outdoor work such as agriculture and construction since 2006. But tackling indoor heat protections has taken years since the state passed legislation in 2016 to draft standards for indoor workers.

The proposed regulations would apply to workplaces ranging from warehouses to schools and kitchens, requiring cooling devices, access to water and cooling-off break areas at certain temperature thresholds as well as monitoring for signs of heat illness.

Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, applauded the vote and said 15 million workers in the state stand to benefit.

""The hottest years on record have occurred in the last 10 years. That means the danger of working in high heat has become more acute in the time it has taken to finalize these standards,"" Kaoosji said in a statement.

California experienced an e-commerce-driven boom in the construction of massive warehouses for companies such as Amazon. Concerns about heat illnesses have been repeatedly raised by workers in the industry.

Amazon said in a statement that its heat safety protocols often exceed industry standards, and it provides air conditioning in all of its fulfillment centers and air hubs.

The Department of Finance sought to halt the Cal/OSHA board's vote, citing concerns about huge costs to correctional and other facilities.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, told the Times the impact ""could be in the neighborhood of billions of dollars.""

The state Office of Administrative Law will need the Department of Finance's approval before it can move forward with the regulations, Palmer said.

Palmer also said the Department of Finance only received some of the data involving the regulations in February.

""This was a decision that was driven by our inability to do our fiscal due diligence and evaluate this data late in the process that had a potential impact to the state,"" he said.

Labor and climate activists opposed the effort to remove the heat-protection item from Thursday's meeting agenda, and board Chair David Thomas agreed.

Last month, a significant attack on Iran's major gas pipelines disrupted vital services, affecting industry and the millions of people relying on gas for heating and cooking across several provinces.

Despite the clear impact, Iranian officials hesitated to point fingers, even as Western sources attributed the blasts to Israel. This incident, followed by subsequent disruptions at the Bandar Abbas Aftab oil refinery and other key sites, reveals a strategic vulnerability.

For Israel, this marks a critical moment to assess the broader consequences of these actions and the apparent reluctance of the Iranian regime to escalate tensions by assigning blame.

To understand why Tehran dispensed with its usual fire and brimstone threats against the ""Zionist enemy,"" a summary of the decades-long shadow war between the two countries is in order.

From its revolutionary start in 1979, the regime has viewed the eradication of Israel, also known as ""Little Satan,"" and the creation of a Palestinian state from the ""river to the sea"" to be a religious and political imperative. With few military resources to take on a regular army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG) has encouraged several - mostly Shia - militias known as the ""axis of resistance.""

Iran's proxies, Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the Houthis, and the Iran-aligned forces in Syria, were to serve as the ""ring of fire"" around Israel. In other words, they could be unleashed in a coordinated move, according to the regime's needs.

In response, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) developed the containment doctrine known as MABAM, a Hebrew acronym for ""war between wars."" According to the former chief of staff, Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the Israeli military sought to prevent a larger conflagration by localized retaliation against the offending proxy or proxies.

Although the IDF targeted Iranian nuclear scientists and IRGC forces attached to militias in Syria and elsewhere, a direct strike on Iranian infrastructure and facilities was ruled out. For instance, between 2010-2012, when the Netanyahu government discussed bombing Iran's nuclear sites in Natanz and Fordo, the idea was overruled by the military.

Naftali Bennett, who became prime minister in 2020, challenged the notion that it was too risky to take on Iran directly. In a well-publicized round of interviews, he called for implementing the Octopus Doctrine: Rather than going after the Octopus's militia tentacles, Israel should cut off the head, Iran.

Bennett argued that the previous doctrine was not likely to deter the regime which, despite its lavish praises for the ""brothers"" of the ""axis of resistance,"" considered them hardly more than cannon fodder. In contrast, the clerical autocracy was particularly sensitive to the loss of its citizens' lives and to potential economic damage from targeted attacks on critical infrastructure.

Bennett's short tenure and the return of the Likud coalition in January 2023 made the Octopus Doctrine redundant. Whatever the merits of attacking Iran directly, the government prioritized pacifying Hezbollah and Hamas. The former built up a large arsenal of missiles, rockets, and drones that threatened Upper Galilee and beyond. The latter used its own considerable arsenal to leverage its demands by periodically barraging Israel.

Each attack was followed by an IDF response, an unsettling reality for settlements along the Gaza border and up to the center of the country. In the years since Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Strip, the military launched numerous reprisals: Operation Summer Rain (June 2006), Operation Autumn Clouds (November 2006), Operation Hot Winter (February 2008), Operation Double Challenge, Operation Cast Lead (December 2008), Operation Pillar of Defense (November 2012), Operation Protective Edge (July 2014), Operation Black Belt (November 2019), and Operation Guardian of the Walls (May 2021).

Ironically, the brutal attack of October 7 reconfigured Israel's security paradigm. The ongoing war in Gaza has resulted in over 1,800 deaths among soldiers and civilians so far. Concurrently, almost daily fire exchanges with Hezbollah have forced around 100,000 residents to flee their homes.

Houthi attacks on Israeli-owned vessels passing through the Bab-al Mandab Strait, coupled with sporadic bombings near Eilat, have escalated tensions. Drone attacks by Iranian-linked militias in Syria further exacerbate the situation, contributing to a near-worst-case scenario as outlined in the ring of fire playbook.

The strikes in Iran signal a return to the Octopus Doctrine minus the Bennett fanfare. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister and a retired general, is said to support a hardline approach toward both Iran and Hezbollah.

The time is certainly opportune to confront the regime bedeviled by a severe economic crisis, including a staggering budget deficit, skyrocketing inflation, and growing dissatisfaction among the population.

A Farsi-language report titled ""The Actual Budget Deficit in Iran's Economy"" sheds light on the severity of the situation. Accordingly, the government is grappling with a budget deficit of some $18 billion and an astounding debt of three quadrillion tomans, equivalent to $71 billion, approximately 31% of Iran's gross domestic product.

Internal issues in Iran have led to nationwide protests

The economic hardships have led to waves of nationwide protests over the past four years. Labor unrest has also been prevalent. In 2023 alone, Iran has witnessed at least 320 labor-related gatherings and 111 labor strikes, with workers demanding improved wages and working conditions.

The water crisis, or as it is called ""water bankruptcy,"" is potentially more destabilizing. The situation is particularly critical in the southern provinces of Sistan and Baluchestan and in Khuzestan, southwest of Iran, but other provinces are not immune, given the failure to institute water conservation measures.

Experts predict that in a few years, water availability will drop to 500 cubic feet per person, the level of absolute scarcity. With farmers abandoning land in the affected areas, extreme migration into the cities is expected to create social chaos within two decades.

Social protest stemming from the killing of Mahsa Amini has diminished due to brutal suppression, including long-term prison sentences and even executions. However, signs of dissatisfaction remain, with some women resisting the hijab law. The regime's legitimacy has been in constant decline, reaching a new low in the March election, where only 41% of eligible voters cast their ballots, the lowest since 1979.

While the extremely hardline government is not about to change its direction, especially on social issues like women's rights, the leaders worry about additional Israeli hits that can further destabilize the country. So much so, that the head of the IRGC Quds Force, Ismael Ghani, ordered Hassan Nasrallah to claim in public that Hezbollah ""will not drag Iran into a war"" should Israel attack.

Israeli leaders should take notice. From an Iranian perspective, the first test of the ring of fire not only failed but exposed the regime's fear of the type of economic dislocation that the pipeline attack has brought.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

The rules still need to overcome opposition by another state agency.

They were approved Thursday by the board of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, despite a late objection from the state Department of Finance because of cost effects on the state, the Los Angeles Times reported.

There is no federal heat standard in the United States. California has had heat protection rules for outdoor work such as agriculture and construction since 2006. But tackling indoor heat protections has taken years since the state passed legislation in 2016 to draft standards for indoor workers.

The proposed regulations would apply to workplaces ranging from warehouses to schools and kitchens, requiring cooling devices, access to water and cooling-off break areas at certain temperature thresholds as well as monitoring for signs of heat illness.

Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, applauded the vote and said 15 million workers in the state stand to benefit.

""The hottest years on record have occurred in the last 10 years. That means the danger of working in high heat has become more acute in the time it has taken to finalize these standards,"" Kaoosji said in a statement.

California experienced an e-commerce-driven boom in the construction of massive warehouses for companies such as Amazon. Concerns about heat illnesses have been repeatedly raised by workers in the industry.

Amazon said in a statement that its heat safety protocols often exceed industry standards, and it provides air conditioning in all of its fulfillment centers and air hubs.

The Department of Finance sought to halt the Cal/OSHA board's vote, citing concerns about huge costs to correctional and other facilities.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, told the Times the impact ""could be in the neighborhood of billions of dollars.""

There is only one doctor left in Kentucky who can officially diagnose miners with black lung disease so that they can get worker's compensation benefits. Kentucky Public Radio's Justin Hicks reports that that is partly due to a restrictive law passed by the state legislature six years ago. Some lawmakers are trying to change that.

JUSTIN HICKS, BYLINE: Brandon Crum's radiology clinic is in a former Walmart in Pikeville, Ky.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

HICKS: Each day, former coal miners come in gasping for air. He ushers them into an X-ray room to take a look.

BRANDON CRUM: That one X-ray that it takes maybe three minutes to do sums up an entire 20- or 30-year history of working in the mines.

HICKS: Many of Crum's patients are diagnosed with black lung. It's an incurable and fatal disease that's been directly linked to coal mining. Research has proven there's a surge of black lung now in Appalachia. Despite his detailed X-rays and patient histories, the state won't refer miners to Crum in order to determine if they should get worker's compensation benefits in Kentucky.

CRUM: I know of nowhere in the United States of America or the world except Kentucky where radiologists cannot read chest X-rays to diagnose a disease.

HICKS: It wasn't always this way. Kentucky used to let radiologists who specialized in coal dust do this work. But in 2018, Kentucky lawmakers changed things so that only pulmonologists can make the official black lung diagnosis. Crum says lawmakers did it to cover up a rise in the deadly disease among coal miners.

CRUM: Because I found too much black lung and complicated black lung. It's the truth.

HICKS: At the time, the coal industry testified that the law was to make diagnosis less subjective. Tyler White, who was president of the Kentucky Coal Association then, said the bill would combat their rising insurance premiums.

TYLER WHITE: These staggering increases deal a significant blow to employers and the overall cost of workers' compensation in Kentucky and now places the Kentucky coal industry at a material disadvantage to neighboring states.

HICKS: Just before the law went into effect, there were 10 doctors allowed to judge Kentucky black lung claims. Then, once fewer doctors were eligible, the rate of miners who were approved for benefits dropped drastically. Today, there's only one doctor who is screening black lung for workers' comp in the state. His name is Dr. Srinivas Ammisetty. He declined to be interviewed.

DOUG HOLLIDAY: He's a very nice person, an honest doctor, a fair doctor, but he's fallible just like anybody else.

HICKS: That's Doug Holliday. As a worker's comp attorney in Hazard, he's very familiar with Dr. Ammisetty, and he says the doctor has become the decisive voice for all of these cases.

HOLLIDAY: If a miner does not agree with the opinion that he has, he ought to have an opportunity to present evidence on the same footing that Dr. Ammisetty stands on.

HICKS: There's efforts to change this, though. Democratic State Representative Ashley Tackett Laferty says it's one of the reasons she ran for office.

ASHLEY TACKETT LAFERTY: There were quite a few bills that were harmful to our coal miners. So definitely, it was certainly a big motivation.

HICKS: Tackett Laferty is carrying a bill this year that would allow radiologists to give their medical opinions to the workers' comp board again, but even she wasn't aware there was only one doctor still participating.

LAFERTY: Well, I am glad to hear that this doctor is located in the vicinity of eastern Kentucky, but, yeah, that concerns me.

HICKS: The bill has been proposed before. But just like those other attempts, this year's version hasn't moved at all.

LAFERTY: We've really been working to try to bring it to the forefront, but, just, it seems like - that it's not working.

HICKS: Until then, coal miners seeking compensation from the mines they believe diseased them will continue to go to Dr. Ammisetty. Ammisetty says he plans to continue diagnosing black lung claims, although he closed his office in Pikeville at the start of the year.

Each session was only eight minutes long, shortened by IndyCar the day before, and tire degradation impacted runs quickly, so drivers mostly had one lap to ensure a quality run. Push-to-pass was provided to the field, giving drivers an additional tool to use to lay down faster laps.

With the unique format for this cash-prize race, there were two separate sessions run, with the driver fastest in each earning the pole for that specific group's heat that will determine the 12-cars to make the finale.

Rosenqvist, who qualified second at the first race at St. Petersburg, continued showing a strong level of comfort with his new ride at Meyer Shank Racing. Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin will start on the outside of the front row for the first heat race. Danish driver Christian Lundgaard was near the top of each open test session over the last two days, but was only able to muster the fourth fastest time in group one.

Session two was going smooth until Marcus Ericsson crashed at the same turn his teammate Kyle Kirkwood did earlier in the day. The ensuing red flag condition, by rule, froze the clock with 1:19 left. This gave teams the chance to run one hot lap, which some did. Callum Ilott who is filling in for injured David Malukas at Arrow McLaren Racing, held the provisional pole up to the red flag. However, Palou was able to get enough out of his tires to put up the fastest time. Teammate Marcus Armstrong will start next to him for Heat 2.

A random draw split the field into the two groups. The first session, consisting of 14 cars, had no incidents. Only Ericsson's crash affected the 13-car second session.

The qualifying speeds will also play a factor after the heat races are run tomorrow. The heat winner with the fastest time will start on pole for the final event.

Since the race is an exhibition, no points were given for winning the pole.

The first of two heats will start tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. ET, on NBC. After the heats are complete, the field will be set for the grand finale and the race for the $500,000 prize in the 2024 $1 Million Challenge.",frontstretch.com,news,Frontstretch,Tom Blackburn,0.2,448938890,1,https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alex-Palou-Thermal-1-Million-Challenge-By_-Chris-Owens_Ref-Image-Without-Watermark_m98726.jpg,eng-9421043

Palou, the reigning and two-time IndyCar Series champion, continued to further establish his strong pace in the weekend's testing after pushing a lap of 1m38.5675s (112.017 mph) to lead the second group.

Chip Ganassi Racing's Scott Dixon set the early mark of the eight-minute qualifying bout, nailing a lap of 1m39.7074.

However, Dixon's time at the top was brief as Christian Lundgaard (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing), who led the final test session earlier in the day, jumped to the lead with less than two minutes remaining.

Moments later, Team Penske's Scott McLaughlin relegated both and assumed the top spot with a minute left. A mere few second later, Rosenqvist delivered his pole-winning run.

Ed Carpenter Racing's Rinus VeeKay slotted third, pushing Lundgaard to fourth.

Rosenqvist ended up claiming the pole by only 0.0237s over McLaughlin and 0.0452s ahead of VeeKay.

The Team Penske duo of Josef Newgarden and Will Power came across fifth and sixth, respectively, which pushed the Juncos Hollinger Racing tandem of Romain Grosjean and Agustin Canapino to seventh and eighth.

The rotation among the group left Dixon, the six-time IndyCar Series champion, falling to ninth.

AJ Foyt Racing's Santino Ferrucci crossed 10.

Colton Herta (Andretti Global) was left abandoning an earlier run after dirt was thrown on the track from another competitor and never recovered to challenge a lap to make the top six, ending up 11.

Dale Coyne Racing rookie Nolan Siegel, who competes full-time in Indy NXT, stood as high as second in the group in the early going before fading to 12.

Kyle Kirkwood encountered similar issues as Herta, his Andretti team-mate, with having to abort an early effort and not able to attack a quick lap, locking in 13.

Sting Ray Robb (AJ Foyt Racing) wrapped up the group in 14.

The furious start to the second group saw Arrow McLaren set the early mark with Pato O'Ward hitting a 1m39.4293s flyer with three minutes remaining, but then knocked down a minute later by temporary team-mate Callum Ilott's lap of 1m39.2527.

Andretti Global's Marcus Ericsson was pressing for a quick lap until he appeared to hit a bump in Turn 8, which led to the rear of his No. 28 Honda to kick out and back into the tire barrier. The incident brought out the red flag with one minute, 19 second remaining.

When the session resumed, Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) established themselves as the trio of Palou, Marcus Armstrong and rookie Linus Lundqvist vaulted to the top three spots.

Lundqvist held that spot until Graham Rahal's No. 15 Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing Honda pulled off a late surge to claim third.

Meyer Shank Racing's Tom Blomqvist was able to slot fifth, behind Lundqvist.

Pietro Fittipaldi (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing) stormed to sixth.

Despite early pace by Arrow McLaren, all faded from seventh through ninth led by Alexander Rossi, then Ilott and followed by O'Ward.

Another CGR rookie, Kyffin Simpson, was able to secure 10.

Christian Rasmussen (Ed Carpenter Racing), rookie Colin Braun (Dale Coyne Racing), and Ericsson rounded out the rest of the group in 11, 12 and 13.

Drivers were split into two groups by a random draw, and the result was a large disparity between the two qualifying runs.

The first group was filled with drivers that have 142 wins between them, while the drivers in the second group only have 31 wins to their name.

Regardless, each driver had the same goal: set the fastest time in a single eight-minute session, utilizing Push to Pass and a new set of tires to start near the front.

Felix Rosenqvist blasted to the front in the first qualifying session, scooting ahead of the other 13 drivers that were pushing the limits on the cooling track and continuing his good run to start the season.

He lapped the course in 1 minute 38.5831 in his Meyer Shank Racing Honda, just a bit slower than the fastest times from the extensive test sessions over the past two days.

Scott McLaughlin and Rinus VeeKay finished second and third in the group, and will start up front for their opening heat race on Sunday.

For the second qualifying round, Alex Palou set the fastest time of 1 minute 38.5675. He took advantage of a lull in the wind to hold off the rest of the field, despite not using all this Push to Pass allocation.

His team-mate Marcus Armstrong set the second fastest time, and Graham Rahal and Linus Lundqvist earned positions on the second row of their heat race.

Marcus Ericsson spun after hitting a bump in the track on his fast lap attempt in group two, and his Andretti Global Honda hit the tire barriers harder than anyone has throughout the entire weekend.

India's coal and lignite production crossed 1 billion tonne as of March 22, surpassing last fiscal's output of 937.2 million tonne 25 days in advance, according to data from coal ministry.

Additionally, the country currently has 96 million tonnes coal stocks available with coal companies. The domestic coal-based thermal power plants maintain coal stocks of 48.2 million tonnes as of March 21 which is sufficient for 21 days, as per the ministry. Coal stocks at Coal India stood at 82.3 million tonnes as of March 22.

""This ample coal reserve ensures uninterrupted power supply across the nation, a crucial factor in sustaining economic activities and meeting the escalating electricity demand, especially during peak consumption periods,"" the ministry said.

The coal ministry has envisaged a target of 1 billion tonne production before the current financial year concludes.

It is now also confident of coal inventory to go up to 155 million tonnes by March 31. Moreover, the share of coal import has declined to 21% during April to January from 22.48% during the corresponding period of previous year, the ministry had said.

here has been a reduction of 36.69 per cent in the volume of coal imported for blending by thermal power plants, amounting to 19.36 million tons (MT) during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the same period of the previous year, the Coal Ministry said on Friday.

This reduction in imported coal for blending signifies a shift towards utilising domestic coal, thus reducing reliance on imports. Imported coal is blended with coal from domestic mines to increase its calorific value.

Conversely, there has been a notable increase of 94.21 per cent in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. These power plants are designed to run only on imported coal, and the growth in imports has been spurred by the sharp decline in international prices of the fuel.

India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54 per cent and 38 per cent respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Overall there has been a reduction in the share of coal import in the total coal consumption in the country. The share of coal import declined to 21 per cent during April 2023 to January 2024, which was 22.48 per cent during the corresponding period of previous year, according to the Coal Ministry statement.

Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278 per cent in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82 per cent during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24.

The reduction in auction premium is a testament to the ample availability of coal (currently 96 MT coal stock with coal companies) in the market, the statement added.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

No one -- not even BP or its drilling partners -- had been questioning whether the companies should bear the full cost of their legal liabilities for the oil spill damages and cleanup. Even without the huge escrow fund that the White House forced BP to surrender to the President's handpicked pay ""czar,"" existing law (rather than executive muscle) would have required BP and its partners to pay multiple tens of billions of dollars in fines, clean-up costs, and damages to those harmed by the spill. Accordingly, the President could have made far better use of his primetime speech if he had laid out a clear plan for how the U.S. government, BP, and other members of the private sector should work in partnership to stop the flow of oil and restore the Gulf Coast region.

The exceedingly adversarial tone and relationship that Obama has established with BP and its partners will, at best, slow the response and recovery effort. It is almost certainly ruining the Administration's chances of receiving (or benefiting from) offers to help from other companies in the private sector. But President Obama's focus on the culpability issues of the spill and condemnation of BP leadership also creates a real risk of chilling future relationships between the federal government and the private sector. Given the indispensable role that businesses have played in responding to natural disasters and terror attacks, it is vital that the President allow existing law to govern the compensation process while making use of his authority as chief executive to form robust, effective relationships between the U.S. government and business.

A Vital Role to Play

The private sector routinely plays an invaluable role in helping those hurt by disaster, especially through its ability to get equipment, services, and supplies to hard-hit areas. For example, the heavy and specialized equipment provided by private sector companies -- as well as those companies' expertise -- was instrumental in locating and rescuing survivors at Ground Zero in Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks. Disaster victims often lack essentials such as food, water, flashlights, and medications. After Hurricane Katrina, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, UPS, Federal Express, and hundreds of other large and small businesses were on the ground delivering goods and services long before the lumbering federal bureaucracy even began deploying its resources.

How the Obama White House works with (or against) BP and its drilling partners will set the tone for the federal government's -- and especially the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) -- future relations with the private sector. The federal government should carefully and respectfully communicate what it expects from the private sector and strive to understand the competitive realities of the marketplace that, necessarily, affect the way businesses interact with government.

For example, although it has been a priority to encourage private sector infrastructure providers to share information with one another and with the federal government, this effort has been stymied by an inability to create a framework that will protect the private sector organizations' competitive advantages while getting valuable information in the hands of counterterrorism authorities.

Further, when an Administration does not manage public-private partnerships expertly and diplomatically, the terms of such partnerships tend to be government-dictated. When this occurs, private sector organizations are either treated as an afterthought or essentially commandeered by government rather than respected as invaluable partners.

Private Sector Should Be Fully and Effectively Engaged

President Obama's discussion of ""the steps we are taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again"" is naïve in that it promotes the unrealistic thinking that the government can somehow eradicate accidents and natural disasters and ""childproof"" America. Obama's rhetoric might give some Americans a false sense of security, but the grave danger is that it provides the U.S. government an excuse to not adequately prepare or mount a prompt and effective response when disaster strikes.

Given that terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and accidents like this oil spill are almost certain to happen again, the right way to move forward will focus on resiliency -- the ability to bounce back when disaster strikes. Bouncing back quickly and with a minimum of collateral damage requires the President and his federal agencies to conduct world-class coordination and communication with the private sector.

As is evident from the U.S. government's impotence in the face of the Gulf Oil spill, the bulk of whatever technical expertise exists to stop the flow and spread of oil resides in the private sector -- i.e., with BP and the other oil industry companies that Obama vilifies daily.

The government, however, still has a crucial role to play: It can coordinate federal agencies as they carry out their congressionally authorized duties in response to disasters, ensuring excellent communication among federal, state, and private-sector organizations. Next steps in terms of the oil spill should include:

The Administration's performance in coordinating the response to the Gulf oil spill has been dismal. No President can afford to delay establishing solid, productive relationships with the private sector until oil starts to spew, an earthquake hits, or a terrorist strikes. At almost every step, however, this Administration has taken actions that seem calculated to put it at odds with the private sector organizations it needs the most when confronting major disasters.

Jeopardizing Future Disaster Responses

BP must be held responsible for any and all damage it has caused and all cleanup efforts it has made necessary. However, the Administration's obsession with both criminal and civil penalties, to the virtual exclusion of an understandable plan for moving forward in partnership with BP, has only ensured that when the next disaster strikes, everyone who could help will just opt to play it safe -- and call their lawyers.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Brian Walsh,-0.3098039215686275,448934791,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,

At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85 per cent of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

After the notification, Adnoc can now export oil stored in the Mangalore storage. (PTI)",dailyexcelsior.com,news,Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K,Daily Excelsior,-0.2392156862745098,448933288,1,https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/oil-1.jpg,

During the 2021 heat dome, that meant few breaks for Khushi Mehta and her co-workers at a Vancouver pizzeria.

""We couldn't really leave new employees on the line by themselves to take a break,"" Mehta said, describing a hot, stuffy workplace with a large pizza oven and little ventilation.

""I don't think there was a lot of emphasis put on physical well-being during our time working in those really high temperatures.""

Mehta quit working in the food service sector a few months after her experience in the heat dome and has since collaborated on projects with Workers Solidarity Network -- a coalition of non-unionized and precarious workers in B.C. -- to find ways that workplace safety could be prioritized during future extreme weather events.

WSN is asking the province to implement a maximum temperature limit for safe indoor work, particularly for food service workers, ahead of an expected hot, dry summer.

SEE ALSO: As B.C. temperatures soar, advocates call for rules to keep rental housing cool

The group plans to rally outside Health Minister Adrian Dix's Vancouver office on Friday afternoon to call for either new legislation or changes to existing rules that would implement a maximum temperature that's safe for people to work indoors, according to Jen Kostuchuk, the climate and labour project co-ordinator at WSN.

Provincially set standards are important for non-unionized food service workers who are often vulnerable to losing paid work if they ask for accommodations, Kostuchuk said.

""For food service workers, refusing unsafe work is very complicated for many of them, when their hours and their wages are on the line or they fear broader employer retaliation,"" said Kostuchuk, who herself worked in the food service industry on and off for 10 years.

""Other jurisdictions like Germany and Spain, for example, have set indoor limits for workplaces at 27 C, and they've also implemented mandatory cooling measures like misters and enforced breaks if temperatures exceed 35 degrees, especially in spaces with hot ovens.""

Kostuchuk said the group is also calling for standards like workers being allowed frequent breaks for water and rest during heat waves, and leniency on dress codes that otherwise often require long black pants and long sleeve shirts even during the heat.

According to Kostuchuk, WSN and its members have sent 185 letters to ministers Adrian Dix, Harry Bains, Bowinn Ma and Premier David Eby on this subject and have yet to hear back.

Bains responded to questions sent directly from The Tyee on behalf of the Labour Ministry. ""Our ministry and WorkSafeBC take workplace risks of any nature very seriously,"" said Bains. ""Last year the province introduced the BC Heat Alert and Response system. We welcome input -- and we will continue to take action to protect workers in the face of our changing climate.""

Currently in B.C., workplace regulations are based on taking enough steps to make sure an employee's core body temperature does not exceed 38 C. Federal occupational health and safety standards suggest a minimum of 18 C and a maximum of 29 C in food preparation areas.

Mehta said her project with WSN came up with a number of ideas for how to improve workplace conditions during heat waves: having a temperature gauge in the restaurant to indicate when it gets too hot to work, and employees being given paid time off in lieu of working during a heat wave are high on the list.

Last year WSN released a report that highlighted food service workers' experiences during the 2021 heat dome and wildfire season that killed 619 people.

In 2021, WorkSafeBC received 115 heat stress claims -- nearly triple the average number of claims between 2018 and 2020 -- and 81 claims in 2022. In a statement to The Tyee, WorkSafeBC said that number dropped down to 49 last summer.

""The past few summers haven't been as extreme as 2021... but I'm hoping that this summer if there is a heat wave, government does push for restaurants not being open"" during the high temperatures, Mehta said.

As a student who moved to Vancouver from India -- where restaurants often shut down during the heat of the afternoon and stay open later during cooler, evening hours -- Mehta said, ""back home we're more prepared for extreme weather than Vancouver as a whole is.""

""In our project we heard from workers who don't have air conditioning in their workplace, and others who fainted on shift due to heat stress,"" Kostuchuk said.

""[People] working in fast food drive-through windows described to us how extreme heat and wildfire smoke has presented adverse physical health impacts for them as well.""

Warmer than usual early spring weather has already broken dozens of temperature records across B.C. as of last weekend.

The upcoming summer season is expected to be a dry one, with snowpack levels across B.C. at nearly 40 per cent below normal this past winter. As a result, B.C. is preparing for an early wildfire season this year and Vancouver Coastal Health's chief medical health officer Dr. Patricia Daly has called extreme weather caused by climate change an ""existential threat to our population.""

Not much has yet been said about preparations for the heat and protections for workers -- whether they work indoors or outside in industries like construction and agriculture -- or for people with disabilities who were demonstrably at higher risk during the 2021 heat dome.",cheknews.ca,news,CHEK,,0.1843137254901961,448933253,1,https://cdn.cheknews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23161431/daniel-bradley-y_WDEY9e6mA-unsplash-e1711235742471.jpg,

In a joint announcement Wednesday, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled the most aggressive multi-pollutant emission standards ever finalized. While the regulations target gas-powered vehicles, they are explicitly designed to push wider nationwide adoption of electric vehicles (EV) and, according to officials, are expected to ensure nearly 70% of all new car sales are zero-emissions within a few years.

""President Biden is investing in America, in our workers, and in the unions that built our middle class and established the U.S. auto sector as a leader in the world,"" White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi said in a statement. ""The President's agenda is working.""

""With transportation as the largest source of U.S. climate emissions, these strongest-ever pollution standards for cars solidify America's leadership in building a clean transportation future and creating good-paying American jobs, all while advancing President Biden's historic climate agenda,"" added EPA administrator Michael Regan.

Under the new regulations, which will be formally announced at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., later on Wednesday afternoon, automakers will be forced to rapidly curb the emissions of greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks, and larger pickups and vans beginning with model year 2027 vehicles.

According to administration officials, the regulations will help ""tackle the climate crisis"" by reducing the transportation sector's carbon dioxide emissions by a staggering 7.2 billion metric tons over the course of the program, which will be in effect through 2032. Officials also told reporters on a press call that the regulations would reduce the amount of oil consumed in the U.S. by billions of barrels within three decades.

When the tailpipe emissions rules kick in, automakers will be compelled to increase production and sales of EVs, plug-in hybrids, traditional hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. Under one ""low cost"" model EPA outlined in the rule, officials said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032.

The regulations represent a version of the so-called ""alternative C"" approach detailed in EPA's original proposal first publicized in April 2023. The White House originally projected last year that, under the rule, up to 67% of new vehicle sales would be battery electric by 2032, but after a lengthy public comment period and meetings with automakers and labor groups, it scaled down the regulations.

""Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,"" President Biden said in a statement. ""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers. Together, we've made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.""

While the EPA rule represents a scaled down version of what the agency proposed last year, especially in the early years of the regulations, industry groups and Republican lawmakers said the end result would remain unchanged. They argue the regulations reduce consumer choice and will lead to higher costs across the board.

In a joint statement on Wednesday, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson and American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers called on Congress to intervene and block the plan.

""At a time when millions of Americans are struggling with high costs and inflation, the Biden administration has finalized a regulation that will unequivocally eliminate most new gas cars and traditional hybrids from the U.S. market in less than a decade,"" they said. ""As much as the President and EPA claim to have 'eased' their approach, nothing could be further from the truth.""

""This regulation will make new gas-powered vehicles unavailable or prohibitively expensive for most Americans,"" the two industry leaders continued. ""For them, this wildly unpopular policy is going to feel and function like a ban.""

In addition to energy groups, a wide slate of industry groups representing farmers, consumers and auto dealers have similarly warned of the consequences of the EPA's regulations.

""This decision will not only severely hamper the administration's ability to reach its own climate goals, but it will also hurt family farms and rural communities that rely heavily on the sale of biofuels. On top of that, it will remove consumer choice from the market,"" said National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle.

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrids -- up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.

At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.

Alliance for Automotive Innovation President and CEO John Bozzella noted Wednesday that, while the EPA's adjusted EV targets are ""still a stretch goal,"" they were more reasonable than the ones first proposed.

""Moderating the pace of EV adoption in 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 was the right call because it prioritizes more reasonable electrification targets in the next few years of the EV transition,"" he said.

Additionally, a wide range of Republican lawmakers immediately blasted the regulations and vowed to take action to overturn them before they are implemented.

""The Biden administration's approval of an EPA rule that essentially forces Americans to buy electric vehicles is just another example of the president's reckless and misinformed regulatory agenda,"" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital. ""I strongly urge President Biden to reverse this misguided decision and allow American families to decide which vehicle is best for them. The free market -- not government mandates -- must prevail.""

Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., who, along with Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., introduced the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act in July, also ripped the regulations. The CARS Act, which would nix EPA's tailpipe regulations, passed in a House vote of 221-197 in December, but it has yet to receive a Senate floor vote.

""Top-down government edicts cannot change the demand of consumers overnight, yet this is exactly the Biden administration's plan,"" said Walberg. ""This rule restricts the choices of American consumers and will price millions out of the market, eliminate American jobs, and forever link our auto industry with the Chinese Communist Party.""

Additionally, Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, both members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, vowed to introduce new resolutions blocking the regulations finalized Wednesday. They said in a joint statement that the plan is ""delusional"" and would require an act of Congress to move forward.",sott.net,news,Signs Of The TImes,,-0.003921568627450966,448933216,1,https://www.sott.net/image/s35/702982/full/Biden_Regan_EPA.jpg,eng-9418288

Published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, it highlights the urgent need for heat protection measures for pregnant workers, especially in tropical countries.

Union health ministry supports more than 12 million poor pregnant women each year.Yet, occupational heat stress and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Indian women have not been studied previously, said the study's corresponding author Vidhya Venugopal. ""Unless adaption measures are prioritised, a 2.5°C global temperature rise will expose 1 billion people to life-threatening heat stress, making heat protection for pregnant workers critical.""

The study, done with scientists from Anna University, Chennai, Oxford University, and Imperial College London, examined the impact of heat exposure on 800 women who were 8-14 weeks pregnant. These women performing moderate to heavy manual work visited primary/urban health centres and outpatient units of tertiary hospitals in six TN districts between 2017-2019 and 2021-2022.

Pregnancy outcomes of 457 women in informal sectors such as agriculture, brick kilns and construction were compared with those of 343 women in schools, commercial banks, garment industry, and hospitals. At least 379 (47.4%) women exposed to heat had poorer pregnancy outcomes. There were 5% miscarriages, 6.1% still/preterm, and 8.4% low birth weights among these women compared to 2% miscarriages, 2.6% still/preterm birth, and 4.5% low birth weight among those not exposed to heat.

Heat-exposed women were 3.5 times more likely to report heat-related illness symptoms than unexposed women. They also exhibited higher symptoms of dehydration and were more likely to experience urogenital symptoms. Women exposed to severe heat in their first trimester had a more than three-fold higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the third trimester, the risk of adverse birth outcomes was two fold.

Women in informal jobs often lacked amenities such as toilets, shade and scheduled breaks, exacerbating the risks of heat exposure. The number of rest periods in an 8-hour shift varied and depended on the season, which determined the start time of the workday. Except for a few informal workplaces, most expectant women in this study engaged in moderate work. Across both groups, approximately half were in their first pregnancy.

More women in the exposed group were from lowest social class.

Olive, believed to be in her 20s, told them: 'One of our key aims in this shift is to break out of this white, middle-class, student bubble that a lot of the time we find ourselves in, and to make our spaces and actions something that all young people want to be a part of.'

A key element of the approach was to work with Muslim groups, and that had to lead to a joint move with Palestine Action.

She said: 'This month, we're doing high-profile action to launch our campaign into the headlines.

'In April, from 7th to 11th, young people from across the country are coming together to take action in London. They're going to be targeting individuals and institutions who are acting that genocide is acceptable. We're going to show that we're on to them and they cannot hide their crimes.

Just Stop Oil leaders boasted they would work with other groups to try to unseat Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer from his Holborn and St Pancras constituency

'We demand politicians stop driving genocide. Oil and gas is genocide. We know what is happening in Palestine is also genocide. Twelve thousand children have been murdered. It's the world's first live-stream genocide. Our government is insanely complicit in this.'

The group's plot to topple Sir Keir was also revealed.

This period of abnormal heat historically occurs in the summer (April-May), but longer and more severe heatwaves, along with higher humidity, are testing human endurance.

Climate change will bring more severe humid heat events, particularly challenging outdoor workers. A recent review shows that 1°C of additional warming, heat, and humidity, will hinder the ability of one in eight people living in the tropics to safely work outside during most daylight hours.

High humid heat conditions in India primarily occur during the summer in the coastal areas. However, much of the country faces high-humid heat during the summer monsoon (June-September). Moisture availability over land and in the atmosphere raises the humidity in the early to mid-summer monsoon. Both dry and humid heat can create heat stress by pushing up the human body's core temperature beyond the thermal comfort limit. Heatwaves with high humidity can be more dangerous because the air cannot efficiently absorb excess moisture, restraining heat exchange, through sweating, between the human body and surroundings.

High humid heat in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar killed several people in June 2023. While heatwaves during the summer are well studied in India, and we know their health risks, humid heat events can also thwart labour productivity, and affect the economy. But they draw less attention.

For instance, a wet-bulb temperature -- a measure of heat that considers dry air temperature and humidity -- of 35°C marks the heat stress tolerance limit. Much lower values can cause serious human health and productivity-related issues. Laboratory studies showed that mild heat stress (18°C, wet-bulb globe temperature) reduces physical work capacity by 10% while the capacity goes down by 78% with extreme heat (40°C).

Several regions in India regularly face daily maximum wet-bulb temperatures surpassing 30°C -- a serious concern for approximately three-quarters of India's workforce engaged in 'heat-exposed' sectors such as agriculture, construction, fisheries, tourism and forestry, which contribute to about half of the country's GDP.

Exceeding 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels will cause around 50 annual hours with dangerous humid heat, which could rise to more than 180 annual hot hours in parts of India , if it rises above 3°C from pre-industrial levels.

The Indo-Gangetic Plain, western India, and eastern coastal India are at the highest humid heat risk.

Given the exposure, vulnerability, and frequency of dry and humid heat events, we must focus urgently on adapting and mitigating heat stress. Most outdoor work-related activities (other than agriculture and fisheries) occur in urban areas, which are rapidly growing in India. More than one-third of India's total population lives in cities, which is projected to be more than half by 2050. Urbanization can contribute significantly to a rise in temperatures that in tandem with high humidity, can create highly humid heat conditions.

There is a need to reduce the urban heat island effect through proper planning and integrating green spaces and water bodies into city development.

Effective adaptation to heat stress needs dedicated and focused interventions at all levels, including government, municipalities, communities, employers, and individuals. Early warning systems for both dry and humid heat play a tremendous role in reducing the adverse impacts. Deaths from dry heatwaves have decreased considerably in India, primarily due to early warning and government awareness campaigns.

Several cities like Ahmedabad and states like Maharashtra, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh have drawn up heat action plans that have been effective and must be replicated. Adequate early warning informs about the potential risks of high heat stress, which can help outdoor workers reduce physical activities. Shifting working hours during high dry and humid heat is also effective. Agricultural workers can be more active in the early morning and late evening hours in summer, while construction activities can shift to the night.

Municipalities and industries can create more green spaces, water bodies, and cooling shelters and stations for outdoor workers to cool off. Mandatory rest breaks make it easier for labourers. This adaptation and resiliency component is critical since one of the main factors exacerbating risks for such workers in tropical regions is the limited ability to adapt due to insufficient infrastructure development, and lack of robust labour regulations.",nature.com,news,Nature,,-0.1294117647058823,448931251,1,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d44151-024-00038-2/d44151-024-00038-2_26889770.jpg,eng-9415534

By Izunna Okafor, Awka

Awka, the capital city of Anambra State, is a place of many prospects, a feature it has continued to breathe out daily on its residents whose number increases on daily basis as the city itself advances towards a facelift. The city is also a place where dreams are bought and sold, as well as a melting pot of ambitions and aspirations. Amidst these throngs of traders, workers and other hustlers who make the capital city bustling, emerges a story that challenges one's perception of dreams and realities of life. This is the story of a young graduate, and a gifted mathematician, who circumstances of the day forced to resort to hawking palm oil as a means of livelihood.

The 32-year-old graduate of Electronic and Computer Technology from the University of Calabar, who hails from Umuahia in Abia State, has his story reflect and encapsulate the aspirations, struggles and the conditions of many young Nigerians today.

This reporter, Izunna Okafor, bumped into a young man around the popular UNIZIK Junction (also known as the UNIZIK Temp. Site) in Awka, where he was seen running to hand over a can of palm oil to a female passenger in a tricycle (Keke), who eventually threw out a cash of N1000 for him, as the tricycle continued its journey. A close observation shows the well-dressed young man as he returned to a spot where other cans of palm oil were also seen, loaded in a white bucket, which he then settled on his head and began to trek down the axis. This moved this reporter to approach him for inquiries regarding what had just transpired and his destination with the bucket of oil on his head.

It was through the interaction that this reporter gathered that the young man, named Ugochukwu Friday Ebubedike, was actually carrying his stock and engaging in his struggle from which he makes a daily living. He hawks palm oil to survive, and he was actually trekking down to deliver some cans of palm oil to a customer who ordered them, alongside additional cans of the stock he might also sell to lucky buyers.

During the interaction, it was observed that Ebubedike was speaking good English, which made this reporter to inquire his educational background. And, surprisingly, he is a graduate of the University of Calabar, where he earned his degree in Electronic and Computer Technology in 2019.

This quite-unravelling conversation made this reporter to buy off the remaining two cans of oil Ebubedike had in his bucket (even when he had no immediate need for oil) for a continued and more relaxed discussion, after he accompanied him to supply the other cans of oil to the person who placed the order.

Further inquiries into Ebubedike's life and background revealed that he came from a family where education was a privilege, and not a right; hence, he clawed his way through school, juggling studies with odd jobs like selling shoes and other footwears, to make up life; and which he sustained till his graduation in 2019. He is the first son in the family of a local bus driver and a caterer, and had to begin early to struggle, so as to pave way for his two younger siblings, having understood the condition of the family better than everyone of them. However, upon graduation, the unfortunate situation of Nigeria hit him, as he found no better job to do.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, a search for greener pasture forced him to relocate to Awka, to seek his fortune in Anambra. Upon his arrival in the city, he resumed his hustle by joining and assisting his friend who then newly launched a shoemaking brand, and from where he also began to sell footwears. He also used the opportunity to learn the skill and craft of shoemaking, but has no capital to venture into it.

When asked other hustles or opportunities he had ventured into to make the ends meet since he came to Awka, Ebubedike, who is also a gifted mathematician, said he had taught mathematics in some private schools, but ended up quiting after some time, because he was being paid a peanut, which did not match his input or reflect the changing economic realities of the country.

""I have taught in two different private schools, but the salaries could not even solve my basic needs, so I decided to quit. Currently, I teach JAMB aspirants at a JAMB lesson centre and also do private/home lessons for students and pupils, most of whom knew me from the private schools where I earlier taught.

""I love molding young ones, and, to me, teaching is a gift. I also teach mathematics online. You can also visit my Facebook page and YouTube page @solving mathematics with ease, for more information,"" he said.

When asked how he ended up hawking palm oil, Ebubedike, who said he does his own palm oil business in a very decent, mature, and classic way, further explained that he launched into the business after a woman in Awka sought his assistance to get palm oil for her from his State, Abia, where she heard the price was cheaper.

""A woman I see as a mentor in Awka here asked me if I could get palm oil from my state for her, and also asked how much it would cost to do that -- a deal I ended up turning into an opportunity. I successfully transacted the business with her, and it 'worked', while I also made my profit. After that deal, she advised me to venture into the business. And that was how I began selling palm oil, till today. This happened early this year, 2024,"" he narrated.

Concerning how he got the kick-off capital to launch into the business to the extent that he can now procure gallons of palm oil (though depending on his financial muscle) at once from Abia State and pay off, Ebubedike said it was a product of trust and agreement between him and one of his friends who saved her next session's school fees in his (Ebubedike's) account

According to him, ""A very good friend of mine gave me her school fee for the next session to keep for her in my account. So, I saw it as an opportunity after my discussion with the woman who advised me to start selling palm oil. So, I informed the friend, and she said no problem, and even encouraged and prayed for me to succeed in the business. Then, I added that to the little savings I had, and began the business immediately.""

Despite his academic background, his mathematical expertise and his passion for teaching, Ebubedike, due to condition, has embraced palm oil hawking as current means of survival, recognizing its stability and demand in the market. While the palm oil business has been his major sustainer, he currently combines the business with his private and JAMB mathematical classes (both online and offline), which hold at scheduled hours in the day, without any of them causing a decay to the other.

Notwithstanding the challenges involved, he finds a way to balance his palm oil business with his love for teaching. It was also gathered that many of his regular customers buy palm oil by placing order for him to supply, both in retail and in wholesales. He said from the little proceeds he makes, he still takes care of himself and his family members, being the first son of the family.

When asked if he had applied for any of the government-provided opportunities that abound for people like him in Anambra State, such as the teachers recruitment exercise, the One Youth Two Skills initiative, and others; Ebubedike said he applied for the One Youth Two Skills, but his name was not shortlisted.

""As for the teachers recruitment, I applied and wrote the exam, but before I knew that applicants needed to also check their result by themselves while waiting for the shortlist, the link wasn't opening anymore. So, I am still hopeful that they will shortlist me when the names are out,"" he said.

Still full of optimism, the UNICAL graduate said he had never been ashamed of doing his palm oil business, as, according to him, anybody who wants to succeed in Nigeria today must first get rid of shame in any good thing he is doing to succeed.

""I am not ashamed at all. This is what keeps me alive and going on daily basis. So, why would I be ashamed of doing it, since it is legit? That is what the situation of the country has brought forth. So, we are in it already. And we only hope it would get better.""

Ebubedike, however, disclosed that many people (especially women and young girls) look down on him and ""rate"" him low, judging by the way they talk to him, because he sells palm oil, including those he assumes may not have written JAMB for the first time in their lives, let alone gaining admission and graduating, with all the stress and the financial implication involved. He, however, blames nobody for his fate and condition, still expressing optimism that things would be better some day, as no condition is permanent.

When asked the nature of assistance or support he needs now, Ebubedike said he needed higher capital to expand the business, adding that he had, in countless occasions, lost some of his customers because he had no money to buy the quantity of the oil they ordered or to procure and deliver it at the time they needed it.

He also expressed his dire need for a gainful employment, to enjoy the full benefit of his education; even as he equally expressed interest to further his studies, harping on his urgent need for sponsorship to enable him realize his full potential.

""Any way or anyhow anybody wants to help or support, I am open and thankful. People can reach me through +2348167760374 . I believe in myself that I have something to offer for the betterment of the society. But I have not been able to do that because I am being retarded by issues of life, occasioned by the condition of the country. And even to travel out is not easy. So, we had to stay back, because this is our country. And I believe different people have something to contribute to make it better. My brother, that is why you see me hustling in my own little and legit way, rather than creating more problem for the country that is also full of problem.

""My fellow youths should also embrace spirit of hustle, for those who have not. That is the only thing that can save us in this country, instead of indulging in crime, tormenting others who are also suffering like you, or waiting for manner to fall from heaven. There's always a humble beginning. With this kind of mindset, I believe we can get there someday, and our past will be a story to inspire others in the nearest future,"" Ebubedike said, as he stood to go receive his pay for some cans of palm oil he earlier delivered to an eatery operator who has called him repeatedly all through the time of his interaction with this reporter, Izunna Okafor.

While it is not out of the usual for Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra to coach an under-manned unit, it still has been a frustrating season in terms of the team's health.

This time around for the Heat's laundry list of injured players, it features players that have been mainstays at this point and some new additions that remains to be seen if it's serious or just a nagging small problem. With 12 games left in the regular season, there is no room for error as Miami is trying to solidify playoff seeding and try to get out of contention for the play-in tournament.

Jaime Jaquez Jr. on the injury report for Miami

One of the new additions to the injury report is rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. who is listed as ""questionable"" with ""Left Knee/Ankle; discomfort."" The first-year player has been a standout for the team and one of the top rookies in the NBA despite being selected with the 18th overall pick.

While he has missed some time this season with six games, he's really been more than reliable for Miami, especially filling in for star Jimmy Butler when he was absent due to injury. The Heat should be giving Jaquez a more substantial update on Sunday before the game.

While not really a new addition, Caleb Martin is on the report, but with a different injury than the known thump sprain as this time around, he's dealing with a ""Right Knee/Ankle; discomfort."" He has had several leg injuries this season so the team is hoping it's not anything substantial or long-term.

Tyler Herro, Kevin Love, and Duncan Robinson still out

For the aforementioned ""mainstays"" on the injury report, Tyler Herro and Kevin Love are once again out for Saturday's crucial game against the Cavs. The Heat have been without both players for multiple weeks now as fans are wondering when will be the next time they see them, if at all before the end of the regular season as they will be missing their 15th and 13th contest respectively.

Duncan Robinson will miss his third game due to ""left facet syndrome"" which started as a back injury where he had to leave in the third quarter of the loss against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 18. He did say Friday that while it isn't ""too serious,"" the Heat is going to be ""smart about it"" or not rushing his return.

""Thankful it's not too serious,"" Robinson said. ""Big thing is making sure [to] calm it down. It's flared up right now. I'm trying to play as soon as I possibly can. Itching to be back out there. As soon as get the clear and OK, I'll be back out there. Taking a couple days helps a lot. The recovery and treatment has helped as well as other things.

""You want to be smart about it,"" Robinson continued. ""I understand down the stretch there is going to be some managing of it from a pain perspective, which I'm ready to embrace, but you don't want to rush back to where it just flares up to where it starts [process] from day one.""

here has been a reduction in the share of coal import in the total coal consumption in the country. The share of coal import declined to 21% during April 2023 to January 2024, which was 22.48% during the corresponding period of previous year.

There has been a reduction of 36.69% in the volume of coal imported for blending by thermal power plants, amounting to 19.36 million tons (MT) during April 2023 to January 2024, in contrast to the same period of the previous year. This reduction in imported coal for blending signifies a shift towards utilizing domestic coal, thus reducing reliance on imports.

Conversely, there has been a notable increase of 94.21% in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

As these power plants are designed based on imported coal only, the growth can be attributed to a substantial decline in import prices of coal during the aforementioned period. India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54% and 38% respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278% in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82% during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24. The reduction in auction premium is a testament to the ample availability of coal (currently 96 MT coal stock with coal companies) in the market.

Another issue is Miami's shooting. Friday, the Heat missed 34 3-point attempts and made just 27.7 percent (13 of 47).

Without Herro and Robinson to hit 3-pointers, the Pelicans had an advantage.

""They were packing the paint and staying in a zone,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, ""and I would have, too.""

To compensate, Heat center Bam Adebayo has become a long-distance threat. He has made at least one 3-pointer in five straight games, shooting 6-of-7 from deep. Before this run, he had only made nine 3-pointers in 472 career games.

The Heat are also getting 3-pointers from unusual sources such as Cole Swider, who went 4-for-6 against New Orleans, and Thomas Bryant, who went 2-for-2.

Bryant, a seldom-used reserve, has played just 33 games this season.

Swider, who is on a two-way contract, had made just eight career 3-pointers before Friday.

Cleveland (43-27) entered the weekend in firm playoff position but have lost two straight games, including a 107-104 home loss to Miami on Wednesday.

On Friday, the Cavaliers lost on the road, 104-91, to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Like Miami, Cleveland is dealing with injury issues. The Cavaliers are missing starters Donovan Mitchell (broken nose), Evan Mobley (ankle) and ex-Heat wing Max Strus (knee).

""They're getting closer to returning,"" Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""But I can't give you a projected timetable.""

Mitchell, who has made the All-Star team each of the past five seasons, has been especially missed. He leads Cleveland in scoring (27.4) and steals (1.8) and ranks second in assists (6.1).

Mobley ranks second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in scoring (15.6).

Strus is second on the team in starts (60) and sixth in scoring (12.2).

Without that trio, Cleveland is relying on starters Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland. Allen is averaging 16.3 points, a team-high 10.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks. Garland is averaging 18.7 points and a team-high 6.3 assists.

Garland's shooting is key as he is making 37.0 percent on 3-pointers, 50.9 percent on 2-pointers and 83.5 percent on free throws.

But without their injured starters, the Cavaliers need more production from players such as Isaac Okoro, Caris LeVert and Georges Niang. LeVert, who is averaging 14.0 points, is the key.

On Friday, the Cavaliers lost on the road, 104-91, to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Like Miami, Cleveland is dealing with injury issues. The Cavaliers are missing starters Donovan Mitchell (broken nose), Evan Mobley (ankle) and ex-Heat wing Max Strus (knee).

""They're getting closer to returning,"" Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""But I can't give you a projected timetable.""

Mitchell, who has made the All-Star team each of the past five seasons, has been especially missed. He leads Cleveland in scoring (27.4) and steals (1.8) and ranks second in assists (6.1).

Mobley ranks second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in scoring (15.6).

Strus is second on the team in starts (60) and sixth in scoring (12.2).

Without that trio, Cleveland is relying on starters Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland. Allen is averaging 16.3 points, a team-high 10.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks. Garland is averaging 18.7 points and a team-high 6.3 assists.

Garland's shooting is key as he is making 37.0 percent on 3-pointers, 50.9 percent on 2-pointers and 83.5 percent on free throws.

But without their injured starters, the Cavaliers need more production from players such as Isaac Okoro, Caris LeVert and Georges Niang. LeVert, who is averaging 14.0 points, is the key.

This follows two recent expert analyses that confirmed deposits and certified the hydrocarbon deposits as having very few impurities.

The low impurity content in the condensate gas, a form of light oil, means little investment is required for processing before selling it to the final consumer.

This enables Zimbabwe to become a producer of natural gas energy in various forms, such as electricity, petrol and diesel; and petrochemical products like plastics, soaps, detergents, solvents, drugs, fertilisers, pesticides and explosives.

Senior officials have previously mentioned early monetisation options, including a gas-to-power plant to address Zimbabwe's electricity challenges.

This would also generate significant revenue for the Treasury. The Government will have a sizeable share of proceeds through a petroleum production sharing agreement, currently being finalised (a global practice in the petroleum sector).

For example, in 2023, Nigeria received the highest payments from Shell in the form of production entitlements, royalties, taxes and fees totalling US$4,92 billion -- the highest figure recorded in four years.

Invictus recently updated its memorandum of understanding with local firm Mbuyu Energy for the supply of gas to power a 500-megawatt (MW) gas-to-power project. Once fully developed, the plant could generate up to 1 000MW. To produce such power, 1,4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas would be required.

This power generation would support further integration of renewable energy sources into Zimbabwe's overwhelmed national grid and the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP).

In a statement on Friday, Invictus CEO MScott MacMillan said the analysis results, while consistent with the firm's basin modelling, exceeded expectations.

The discovery was historic, representing the first-ever instance of hydrocarbons discovered in Zimbabwe, a country also rich in other minerals like gold, lithium, diamonds and platinum.

Announcing results from the latest fluid sample analysis, Mr MacMillan confirmed a substantial rich gas-condensate discovery at the Mukuyu field. This sets the company up for continued success in the Mukuyu Upper and Lower Angwa geological trends.

""The samples demonstrate a consistent, high-quality natural gas composition with low inert content, less than 2 percent CO2 (carbon dioxide) and nil H2S (hydrogen sulfide), which will require minimal processing for sale,"" he said.

""In addition to gas condensate proven in the Upper and Lower Angwa formations, we have further evidence of the presence of light oil in the Upper Angwa and potentially Dande formation from multiple hydrocarbon source rocks and charge events.""

Initial analyses suggest the hydrocarbons present in the Mukuyu field were generated and expelled from both local source rock intervals within the Mukuyu structure and migrated from other source rock-rich areas off-structure.

""These results bode well for the presence of hydrocarbons in the prospects and leads in the remainder of the company's acreage, which has been derisked by the Mukuyu gas-condensate discovery,"" Mr MacMillan continued.

Global petroleum research firm Wood Mackenzie classified the Mukuyu gas finding as the second-largest petroleum reserve in Africa in 2023.

Mukuyu's estimated resource is 230 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) (1,3 trillion cubic feet), following two gas discoveries from the Upper and Lower Angwa geological reservoirs declared by Invictus in December 2023.

Wood Mackenzie's review also noted that regional exploration yielded seven discoveries from a total of 17 wells drilled across the continent in 2023, with Invictus accounting for two of them.

The Mukuyu field has a structural closure of over 200 square kilometres, and independent estimates place the resource at 20 trillion cubic feet of gas and 845 million barrels of conventional gas condensate.

""The gas-condensate composition results are exceptionally positive and exceeded our pre-drill expectations with high-quality, liquids-rich gas with low inerts found in both Mukuyu wells,"" Mr MacMillan said.

""This allows us to target a low-cost early monetisation development with minimal processing of the gas at the surface from the Mukuyu field.""

Early monetisation of the oil/gas project could bring significant relief for Zimbabwe, which already struggles to meet half of its national power demand, peaking at 2 200MW, especially during winter.

Zimbabwe's power deficit is managed through imports, which can result in power outages lasting for several hours, disrupting commercial and household activity.",sundaymail.co.zw,news,Sunday Mail Zimbabwe,Sunday Mail,0.2313725490196079,448927570,1,https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/03/invictus-680x380.png,

A 27-year-old Pinole woman was fatally shot Saturday morning at an East Oakland gas station, authorities said.

The shooting happened about 5:48 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Serv gas station, 2200 East 12th Street.

The woman was pronounced dead at the station.

It was not immediately clear if the woman had driven to the station to purchase gas or something from the store. Police are still trying to determine why she was in Oakland.

Investigators are trying to determine a motive for the killing. No suspect information has been released.

The killing is the 18th homicide investigated by Oakland police this year. Last year at this time police had investigated 24 homicides in the city.

Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering up to $10,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the killer. Anyone with information may call police at 510-238-3821 or 510-238-7950 or Crime Stoppers at 510-777-8572.

The gas station has been the scene of several shootings in the past few years.

Among them was a 6-year-old boy wounded in the leg by a stray bullet during a shootout between other people in June 2023.

Miami (38-32) is only 17-16 at home and entered the weekend outside of the guaranteed top-six playoff spots in the Eastern Conference.

For context, the Heat went 27-14 at home last season.

While it doesn't answer why the Heat have been better on the road (21-16) this season, the team has suffered several injuries. In Friday's 111-88 home loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (foot) and Josh Richardson (shoulder).

In fact, the Heat have already used a franchise-record 34 starting lineups this season. Entering Saturday, only Memphis (42) and Portland (37) had used more.

Another issue is Miami's shooting. Friday, the Heat missed 34 3-point attempts and made just 27.7 percent (13 of 47).

Without Herro and Robinson to hit 3-pointers, the Pelicans had an advantage.

""They were packing the paint and staying in a zone,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, ""and I would have, too.""

To compensate, Heat center Bam Adebayo has become a long-distance threat. He has made at least one 3-pointer in five straight games, shooting 6-of-7 from deep. Before this run, he had only made nine 3-pointers in 472 career games.

The Heat are also getting 3-pointers from unusual sources such as Cole Swider, who went 4-for-6 against New Orleans, and Thomas Bryant, who went 2-for-2.

Bryant, a seldom-used reserve, has played just 33 games this season.

Swider, who is on a two-way contract, had made just eight career 3-pointers before Friday.

Cleveland (43-27) entered the weekend in firm playoff position but have lost two straight games, including a 107-104 home loss to Miami on Wednesday.

On Friday, the Cavaliers lost on the road, 104-91, to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Like Miami, Cleveland is dealing with injury issues. The Cavaliers are missing starters Donovan Mitchell (broken nose), Evan Mobley (ankle) and ex-Heat wing Max Strus (knee).

""They're getting closer to returning,"" Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""But I can't give you a projected timetable.""

Mitchell, who has made the All-Star team each of the past five seasons, has been especially missed. He leads Cleveland in scoring (27.4) and steals (1.8) and ranks second in assists (6.1).

Mobley ranks second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in scoring (15.6).

Strus is second on the team in starts (60) and sixth in scoring (12.2).

Cairo:

A Panama-flagged crude oil tanker caught fire after being struck by an unidentified projectile off Yemen on Saturday, in the latest attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

The incident happened 23 nautical miles northwest of the Red Sea port of al-Mukha, British maritime security firm Ambrey said.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency also reported the incident, saying the fire was extinguished by the crew.

""Vessel and crew reported safe. Vessel continuing to next port of call,"" UKMTO added in an advisory note.

Ambrey said the tanker was registered under Union Maritime Ltd, a UK company, in 2019 before changing its registration details, including name and operator, last month.

""At the time of writing, she had changed course to starboard and continued on her journey to New Mangalore, India,"" the Ambrey statement said.

Months of attacks in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi operatives following the Israel-Hamas war have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa, and stoked fears that the war could spread to destabilise the wider Middle East.

The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and they will not stop until Israel ends the war and withdraws from the enclave.

The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and redesignated the militia as a terrorist group.

Mitchell, who has made the All-Star team each of the past five seasons, has been especially missed. He leads Cleveland in scoring (27.4) and steals (1.8) and ranks second in assists (6.1).

Mobley ranks second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in scoring (15.6).

Strus is second on the team in starts (60) and sixth in scoring (12.2).

Without that trio, Cleveland is relying on starters Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland. Allen is averaging 16.3 points, a team-high 10.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks. Garland is averaging 18.7 points and a team-high 6.3 assists.

Garland's shooting is key as he is making 37.0 percent on 3-pointers, 50.9 percent on 2-pointers and 83.5 percent on free throws.

Prosecutors, seeking $11 billion in compensation and up to 50 years of imprisonment, say Bankman-Fried, ""driven by greed and hubris"" repeatedly gambled other people's money and that his education and privileged upbringing equipped him with the knowledge to know that he was acting illegally.

The defense lawyers maintain that FTX investors will eventually recover their money and have requested leniency from Kaplan, suggesting a sentence of between five and six years.

The shares were being promoted while Dills allegedly used his controlling influence over Oncology Pharma, to have the company publish press releases to make its stock more appealing to investors.

The complaint alleged that Dills, by dividing his Oncology Pharma ownership between two front companies, transferring shares to Padilla, and then sharing in the proceeds of Padilla's illegal sales, purposely flouted the registration requirements of federal securities law.

Dills consented to a final judgment that permanently bars him from dealing in penny stocks. The judgment ordered Dills to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $6.2 million, and fees amounting to $1 million.

In a 28-page decision promulgated in October 2023 but made public only on Friday, the high court en banc said the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed a local court's ruling, which found the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was liable to pay the provincial government of Bulacan a share in the utilization and development of national wealth.

""The moment that water from Angat River is already appropriated and impounded into the Angat Dam, it ceases to form part of natural resource,"" the high tribunal said in a decision penned by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul Inting.

READ: SC: Water concessionaires can't pass corporate income tax to customers

The Supreme Court effectively granted the MWSS petition for review on certiorari as it reversed and set aside the 2008 decision of the appellate court in favor of Bulacan province.

The case stemmed from the complaint for specific performance/payment of national wealth share against MWSS filed by the provincial government of Bulacan through then Gov. Josefina Dela Cruz.

The Bulacan government said MWSS had been getting proceeds from the water resource of Angat Dam, which is located within its territorial jurisdiction.

It claimed MWSS must pay the local government a share of the utilization and development of national wealth.

However, the MWSS argued it was a nonprofit service utility created to provide water supply and a wastewater disposal system to Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces.

The MWSS added water stored in Angat Dam did not necessarily come from Bulacan as it was simply stored in the catchment.

As a man-made structure, the dam, according to the MWSS, does not fall within the scope of national wealth that would entitle a local government like Bulacan to a share in the proceeds derived from its utilization and development.",newsinfo.inquirer.net,news,Inquirer.net,Jane Bautista,0.5529411764705883,448926664,1,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2022/02/Regions243512.jpg,

With Duncan Robinson out the past two games and possibly for the foreseeable future, Swider saw his first action against New Orleans and could very well see more as Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra and star Bam Adebayo gave their thoughts on how he performed.

Swider came in to the game in the second quarter where the Heat were shooting dreadfully from three-point range as by that time, they only made two of their 19 attempts from that range. He would make his first two shot attempts from deep that was eye-opening.

While the two players are different in a lot of ways, the 24-year old is trying to fill the void of the aforementioned Robinson who excels at shooting from beyond the arch. He even just made history on March. 17 against the Detroit Pistons where he became the fastest player in NBA history to drain 1000 made three-pointers in 343 games, passing Buddy Hield.

Spoelstra says Swider earned his opportunities with Heat

It's a big hole to fill, but in any sense, Spoelstra was impressed with Swider who would finish the game with 14 points, making four of his six attempts from deep. He said that with all the development he's been doing in practice and time with the Heat's G-League team with the Sioux Falls Skyforce, ""he's earned these kinds of opportunities.""

""It's not an easy role to come in there to see there's been a bunch of missed shots, I have come in there and I have to make the longest shot in this game. That's not an easy deal,"" Spoelstra said. ""But he's really worked at things, you know, as part of development and then all of the games in Sioux Falls have kept him in the same system and he's really played extremely well there. So he's earned these kinds of opportunities and probably maybe in some more throughout the course of the season. Overall were not able to do enough things offensively, it wasn't only the three ball, as I've been saying.""

Before this game, Swider had not reached double digit minutes in a game since Nov. 25 against the Brooklyn Nets where he played 20 and scored 11 points. He really took notice during the Heat's training camp where he was working with Robinson as the two share the same strength in their deep-ball shooting.

Adebayo says Swider needs more minutes, but sees major improvement

It could pay off, but with the continued absence of Robinson, it seems like more minutes and playing time that was once sparse could come plentiful. Star Bam Adebayo has noticed the improvement in the Syracuse product saying that while he definitely ""needs more minutes,"" there has been a clear change in how ""the game is starting to slow down"" for Swider.

""He's gone need more minutes but I think the game is starting to slow down for Cole. He's starting to understand that he can tell other people what to do. He can tell somebody to run a different play for him,"" Adebayo said. ""It comes with confidence, I feel like his confidence is starting to going in the right direction. And that's obviously due to behind the scenes of practice, pre practice, and getting this work in obviously talking to some of the older vets like Patty and obviously the guy he's emulating in Duncan [Robinson].""

Swider called himself ""one of the best shooters in the world""

Swider has been waiting patiently to hear his name called by Spoelstra, especially since the very first preseason game of this season where the Heat beat the Charlotte Hornets on Oct. 10. Swider scored 17 points and hit five three-pointers in that game and made a very bold claim after, saying that ""I'm think I'm one of the best shooters in the world.""

""They just kept on telling me to keep shooting. I have a lot of confidence in myself as a shooter,"" Swider said. ""I think I'm one of the best shooters in the world. My teammates kept finding me.""

More minutes for Swider coming for Heat in home stretch of the season?

However, while the confidence was brewing high then, he was still humbled at the time saying he wasn't under a contract. Since then, the Heat would sign him to one, but there are now future steps in the journey like getting more playing time.

""I'm not on a contract still so there's nothing to be really excited about. If you get to this level, you expect a certain level out of yourself. I think before I might have gotten ahead of myself,"" Swider said last October. ""But I just want to keep on stacking one day at a time. Keep on trying to help myself and help this team get to a point where where I'm in the rotation and I help this team win.""

In the most important part of the regular season as there are 13 games left, Swider could be seeing his most important minutes come in his NBA career so far. His next chance to play will be against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday as Miami is 38-32 which puts them seventh in the tightly packed Eastern Conference.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Zachary Weinberger,-0.04313725490196074,448926503,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Erik-Spoelstra-Bam-Adebayo-praise-Miami_s-secret-weapon-after-Pelicans-loss.jpeg,

Since the start of 2024, Ukraine has operationally mass-deployed its new indigenous ""Liutyi"" one-way attack long-range unmanned aircraft, conducting precise strikes deep inside Russia, crippling more than a dozen of Russia's high-value industrial assets, including refineries, oil depots, and factories across an 800km radius of Ukraine's borders.

Liutyi is just one among multiple long-range suicide drones developed or repurposed by Ukraine, but its performance has distinguished it from other models. The ongoing three-month campaign to undermine Moscow's fuel production capacity has been successful, with about 7% of Russia's refining capacity idling in the first quarter of 2024.

The Ukrainian military news portal Militarnyi compiled detailed information on the Liutyi drone, a key asset for Ukrainian intelligence agencies in their latest deep rear bombing campaign against Russia. Here is what we know about the Liutyi, based on Militarnyi's report and several other sources.

Ukrainian defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom publicly announced the development of the Liutyi in October 2022. The firm said it intended to create an attack drone weighing over 200 kg, capable of carrying a 75 kg warhead at a distance of more than 1,000 km. It is the first Ukrainian system analogous to Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones in terms of payload, range, and autonomous attack ability.

The new drone was a response to the requirements laid out in early August by then-Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. When unveiling an element of the Liutyi's fuselage, Ukroboronprom included the biblical inscription ""Az Vozdam"" (Old Slavonic for ""I will repay,"" referring to the Bible's Romans 12:19) - a sign indicating forthcoming retaliatory strikes against Russian assets. The name Lityi, in turn, means fierce/furious or February in Ukrainian.

Militarnyi has learned from its own sources that the Liutyi's approximate cost is twice as much as the previous Bober (""Beaver"") attack drone. The latter is known to have been purchased by Serhii Prytula's Foundation for 4 million UAH per unit (about $100,000).

Project ""Black Box"": How Ukrainians unknowingly crowdfunded deadly new drone fleet

The Liutyi represents a step up in Ukrainian drone technology and offensive reach. It is an unmanned low-wing monoplane powered by a gasoline engine and equipped with an advanced satellite-aided inertial guidance system for autonomous navigation over long distances.

In the initial stages of the Liutiy drone project, there were claims that the drone would serve as a versatile platform, but it's unclear from publicly available information whether this goal was achieved, or if the Liutiy was solely deployed as a one-time kamikaze drone, Defense Express says.

Based on open information and multiple photos of the wreckage shared by Russians from the first three months of the Liutyi's deployment in 2024, its design and capabilities can be analyzed in depth. The unmanned low-wing monoplane has a 6.7-meter wingspan and 4.4-meter length, with a maximum takeoff weight between 250-300 kg. The drone boasts aerodynamics optimized for extended range.

Its pusher configuration sees a gasoline piston engine with a three-blade propeller installed in the rear fuselage. This weight distribution likely allows for a heavy explosive warhead in the nose. The drone has a fixed undercarriage for takeoffs and landings from roads or runways.

The sleek aerodynamic fuselage with winglets aids in maximizing range. It mounts a pitot tube under the nose for measuring airspeed and altitude. The composite fuselage uses fiberglass, epoxy resin, metal mesh, and wood for stiffness.

To ease logistics, the Liutyi breaks down into major components - the nose section with the warhead, fuel tank, and engine; removable wings; and empennage attaching near the engine nacelles.

The wreckage of the Ukrainian drone's engine shares design similarities with the German Hirth F-23 50hp aviation engine, estimated to cost around $5,000. Militarnyi notes that distinctive cylinder heads, mounts, and electrical features match this commercial piston engine model.

The Liutyi's thick-walled steel warhead casing weighs approximately 50 kg, according to Russian sources, down from Ukroboronprom's initial 75 kg claim, but this precision-guided munition has proved more than adequate to wreak havoc on Russian infrastructure. Its bladed exterior suggests enhanced forced fragmentation over a penetrating shaped charge.

Other features like attachment rings point to it being crane-loaded into the drone's nose section right before launch, implying a modular design. However, the initiation system seems deficient based on the number of intact unexploded warheads found.

The most significant advancement is Liutyi's improved inertial guidance aided by satellite signals. All previous Ukrainian strike drones relied solely on this traditional system susceptible to jamming and navigation drift.

By enhancing the satellite antenna's shielding and likely adding backup data links, the Liutyi displayed pinpoint accuracy in striking exact components from over 1000 km away during night bombardment runs into Russia.

Ukraine starts mass production of 750 km range ""kamikaze"" drones

The drone platform's modular design allows it to be broken down for easier transportation and logistics. Its fairly compact size, when disassembled, permits launch from improvised sites like roads, rather than requiring dedicated airstrips. This operational flexibility enhances survivability and complicates Russian countermeasures.

Drone strikes crippled the Yakovlev Explosives Plant in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, - a producer of explosive materials for Russian munitions. Other drones hit the Lipetsk Metallurgical Combine, disrupting some steel supplies.

Militarnyi believes the warhead's bladed casing design, rather than a penetrating shaped charge, indicates an intent to inflict widespread fragmentation damage ideal for wrecking machinery and inflicting casualties in the open.",euromaidanpress.com,news,Euromaidan Press,Yuri Zoria,-0.05098039215686279,448926468,1,https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ef265f14ead88175.jpg,eng-9418468

It got a bit too hot in the kitchen for the Miami Heat on Friday, the last before Easter weekend. The New Orleans Pelicans just brought too much smoke off the bench to start the spring cookout season, beating Miami 111-88 in South Beach.

Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall added a bit of extra spice to the meeting, too. This was expected since they were both suspended for an altercation that occurred the last time these two teams squared up in late February.

Willie Green's Pelicans know Alvarado stays amped up. Green and Alvarado had to hug out a sideline dustup once this season already. Still, whether it's a flop of a night performance-wise or a fight-of-the-night rumble, New Orleans knows what to expect from their brash bench options. The third-year coach appreciates how Alvarado and Marshall can put the past behind them and move on with the season.

""Incredible effort tonight by our bench,"" Green complimented. ""They didn't have a great game against Orlando but they came out tonight and they responded right away. Jose, Naji, Larry (Nance Jr.). (Jonas Valanciunas) and Trey (Murphy III) are kind of going back and forth. But collectively as a group, it was a big-time win for us.

""Jose and Naji are our energy guys,"" continued Green. ""They are the emotional leaders on our team. When they bring it like they do, it galvanizes the group. It was fun, it was fun to see those guys respond after not having the game they wanted to have (against the Orlando Magic).""

Green also publicly shared that he allowed the locker room to take Friday's game a bit more personally. That message got back to the Pelicans social media team as well judging by the troll job published as soon as the final buzzer sounded.

""For sure, it was a little extra,"" Green explained. ""They said some things in the media. We heard it. Our guys wanted to respond and that's the deal. That is what makes this fun. That is what makes sports fun. You get a little trash talk back and forth. Then you get to go out on the floor and compete against each other. That's what it was tonight. It was two teams competing, trying to make plays...and we're glad to be on the winning side.""

Jose Alvarado outplays Jimmy Butler in Pelicans win

Alvarado matched Jimmy Butler's scoring, finishing with 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Butler had five assists and four rebounds. Marshall added 13 points, seven rebounds, an assist, and a steal. The duo played a combined 54 minutes after being challenged pregame to bring their usual intensity.

""It was huge. I was hurt in that game so I was in the back when everything went down,"" CJ McCollum said of Alvarado and Marshall. ""They were great and responded really well. Coach challenged them before the game to be themselves, to be their best selves. Be aggressive and impact the game. We got arguably the best bench in the league and they showed it tonight.""

The two undrafted, minimum-level contract guys brought maximum effort against the Heat. But they do that every night, a known fact for anyone paying attention to the Pelicans. It's a big reason why Alvarado and Marshall are two of the most beloved players in franchise history. Their spark off the bench has led to some of the team's most memorable moments, not to mention the crowd-pleasing, winning basketball its largely played since relocating to New Orleans.

Alvarado and Marshall can add to those legacies by helping the Pelicans on a deep playoff run this spring, though neither will likely ever have to pay for a drink in the city ever again regardless.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Chris Dodson,-0.003921568627450966,448925671,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pelicans-use-reserve-energy-to-fuel-revenge-win-over-heat.jpg,eng-9419358

""Dam removal restores the natural flow regime, which helps restore natural flow, water depth and ecological conditions,"" said Liz McKercher, director of the water planning division for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

The White Mill dam, being a low-head dam, causes safety issues for tubers and boaters, McKercher added.

City officials are seeking state grant money to help cover the cost of removing the Long Mill Dam.

The Danville City Council voted 6-2 on Feb. 20 to apply for $1 million from the Virginia Dam Safety, Flood Prevention and Protection Assistance Fund for the project.

The vote to seek state money for removal of the dam came about a year and a half after the council passed a resolution on July 5, 2022, approving the dam's removal.

The 6-3 vote nearly two years ago came after public debate over the proposal, with at least one opponent on City Council concerned about how demolition of the dam would affect the river's depth for boaters.

The concrete dam -- owned by the city -- stretches 1,144 feet across the Dan River and is 5 feet tall.

The dam is believed to have been built around 1894 to create water power for the Dan River Inc. factories along both sides of the Dan River. For most of its history, it was not accessible to the public.

City Manager Ken Larking had recommended tearing down the dam at the time because the move would bring state and federal permitting advantages to the Riverfront Park and Dan River Falls projects, which are now under construction.

The Riverfront Park is expected to be complete by the end of this year, with the neighboring Dan River Falls commercial and residential development anticipated to be finished by early 2025.

Larking had recommended the dam's removal not only because the structure is dangerous but because the move would reduce flooding, restore fish passages, create natural sediment movement and reduce bank erosion.

Larking had cited past deadly incidents involving dams in the region.

Five-year-old Kolton Karnes drowned at the Brantley Steam Plant dam in 2010. He was the fourth person to drown at one of the Dan River's low-head dams since 1965. The dam, which was located downstream of the Long Mill dam, was removed in 2011.

In August 2020, 76-year-old Axton resident Ronald Edward Reynolds died after the canoe he was in with his grandson capsized twice at the bottom of the White Mill dam.

""Dam removals are beneficial for rivers regardless of where they are in the country,"" said Jessie Thomas-Blate, director of river restoration for American Rivers, based in Washington, D.C.

The organization focuses on restoring and protecting rivers across the country.

Low-head dams interfere with safe recreation, Thomas-Blate said.

""A lot of low-head dams are safety hazards for people, especially if there is no signage,"" she said. ""People can potentially go over them.""

Likening rivers to arteries in the human body, Thomas-Blate said dams act like clots, or walls.

""When you have a clot in your artery, that's not good for you,"" she said. ""They [dams] block the normal function of a river.""

When there is a dam in place, it affects the ability of fish and other organisms to move around in the river, she added.

""It hampers their ability to access the habitat they need"" for spawning or finding food, Thomas-Blate said.

Paul Angermeier, professor at Virginia Tech's department of fish and wildlife conservation, agreed.

""They [fish] are going to do better in the absence of those dams,"" Angermeier told the Danville Register & Bee. ""They're obstructions to movement.""

Also, dams tend to accumulate sediment due to the structures' impoundment, or area of backwater just upstream at the top of the dam.

""If there are any toxins in there, that would be something [Danville] would need to know and to sample,"" he said.

Sediment can settle at the bottom of the river where water stands still. Removing the dam will bring a smooth flow, cleaning the fine sediments from areas better enabling fish to reproduce, Angermeier said.

With a dam, ""sediment settles at the bottom, making it unsuitable for fish who reproduce there,"" he said.

""You don't want the sediment there,"" he said. ""It's basically a suffocating material.""

Without a smooth flow of water to clear sediment, silt or thin mud could fill gaps between gravel where the eggs are, leaving them unable to get oxygen, he said.

""Flow would prevent silt and mud from settling between the rocks and causing suffocation,"" Angermeier said.

But reducing the depth immediately upstream of the dam could affect fish used to deeper water, said Erich T. Hester, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.

""If you get rid of that deeper water, that may not be good for them,"" Hester said.

However, aquatic organisms adapt to whatever the circumstances are, he said.

Low-head dams do not have a huge impact on water flow, he added.

""They don't change the water flow appreciably,"" Hester said, adding that they raise the water level upstream.

As for sediment, Hester said removing the dam may not have a big effect, ""but the question is what happens with that."" It can change the environment for aquatic life downstream while it's moving through, ""but usually before long, that sediment readjusts and everything settles down,"" Hester said.

Neither Thomas-Blate nor Angermeier are fans of dams left over from past industrial use.

""It's important to address dams if they're no longer needed or are breaking down,"" Thomas-Blate said. ""From a safety perspective, they deteriorate over time.""

""I'm not a big proponent of dams in general, especially if they're relics of some previous use,"" Angermeier said.

They can also become what Thomas-Blate referred to as ""an attractive nuisance"" that poses dangers.

""People might think it's fun to climb on and then end up in an unsafe situation,"" she said.

Low-head dams have hydraulics at their bases that can suck people in and cause them to drown, she said.

According to the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources, low-head dams ""are deceptively dangerous.""

""Over the years, houseboats, fishing vessels, powerboats, sailboats ... kayaks and canoes have all fallen victim to low-head dams,"" according to the department's website.

Water flowing over a drop forms a hole or hydraulic at the base which can trap objects washing over the drop, according to the department's website.

""Once swept over the dam, the victim becomes trapped and is forced underwater, pushed away from the dam, then circulated to the top,"" the website states. ""The circulating motion then repeats the cycle over and over again as the individual is drawn back against the base of the dam.""

Dams pose the following dangers to boaters, according to the department's website:

Dams are difficult to spot from upstream and often are not marked by signs or buoys.

Dam hydraulics are unpredictable.

Dams can deceive even experienced boaters.

The concrete walls at the side of the dam-face block the exit route for individuals trying to escape.

Areas immediately downstream also present risk as the water is flowing upstream.

Rescuing trapped individuals is dangerous and often unsuccessful.

Regarding water depth for boaters once the dam is removed, ""that area upstream of the dam, the water will get more shallow,"" Hester said.

""If you're in a boat that needs depth, then that would go away,"" Hester said. ""More than likely, what winds up happening is the flow conditions go back to what they were downstream of the dam.""

Such structures that have been in place a long time, like the White Mill dam, become part of the landscape and people get used to them, said Thomas-Blate, who has been involved in numerous dam removal projects, mostly in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

""It's hard for people to envision what it would look like because's it's been there their entire life,"" she said. ""The area will look different. It doesn't mean it's bad. It's just a change.""

On the night of March 23, the Russian Federation reportedly faced an attack from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as announced by the Russian Ministry of Defence's press service.

The Russian authorities claimed that nighttime attacks on Russian territory by UAVs were allegedly carried out by Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence reported a total of twelve ""intercepted and destroyed"" drones.

Five drones were allegedly shot down in the Bryansk and five in the Belgorod regions. One drone was downed in both Voronezh and one in the Saratov regions.

The Russian Ministry of Defence also claimed that around 7:00 am Moscow time, an alleged attack on Russian territory was repelled. The department asserts that the attack was executed using an RM-70 ""Vampire"" multiple rocket launch system.

""The air defence systems on combat duty destroyed eleven rockets in the airspace above the Belgorod region,"" the statement read.

Local media in Belgorod reported explosions and posted corresponding photographs.

The governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, stated that drones attacked two municipalities - Starooskolsky district and Chernyansky district. He also confirmed reports of shelling in the city of Belgorod, noting that there were casualties.

""Data is currently being verified; I will certainly report a little later,"" the official wrote.

But this has not been the case.

As he outlined his government's plan towards attaining the Vision 2030 goals, the Head of State resorted to a now familiar line, delivered whenever his pet projects have faced defeats in court.

His detractors, Dr Ruto suggested on Thursday, were bribe-takers who thrived in blackmail. The Head of State cut a frustrated figure, a far cry from the triumphant look he should have worn, having just signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.

On that very day, the High Court declined to temporarily halt the controversial 1.5 per cent pay deduction to fund Ruto's affordable housing plan - another victory for the president.

But recent experience has taught him not to rest easy until the Judiciary approves his policies. The new housing law, a product of the High Court's nullification of sections of the Finance Act 2023, is facing court challenges.

The president has not been as successful in court as he has in Parliament. Indeed, courtesy of his control over Parliament, the Affordable Housing Bill sailed easily through the bicameral House. As they had done previously, Ruto's troops subdued whatever opposition the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition party had mounted.

From the start, it was always clear that Ruto had a fine strategy to have his way in Parliament, which mostly involved wooing opposition lawmakers into his Kenya Kwanza Alliance.

Bolstered by his numerical advantage, he would say he wanted a ""strong opposition"" to check the government's excesses. And he was, seemingly, prepared for them, having observed their most preferred strategies.

In the face of Opposition demonstrations, Ruto unleashed a strong police reaction, faulted in some quarters for their heavy-handedness. In Parliament, he was assured of victory even in the most inconsequential of debates.

However, the president seems ill-prepared for the kind of opposition he faces, coming from all corners. On one end is the civil society, which has been eager to test the constitutionality of the president's policies.

Seasoned public-interest litigants, such as Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, and the Law Society of Kenya are also hitting hard, forcing the government back to the drawing board.

Besides the nullification of the housing levy that forced Ruto into establishing a new law, the courts also quashed his appointment of chief administrative secretaries (CASs). Parliament is processing a Bill that could see the president appoint an unlimited number of CASs, which could attract another legal battle.

The High Court also recently quashed the deployment of police officers to Haiti. Ruto's losses in court also include conservatory orders issued against his projects in several instances, such as the one suspending the implementation of the new Social Health Insurance Fund programme, which was lifted in January.

Nursing the court defeats, the president went on an attack against judicial officers, whom he accused of receiving bribes to frustrate his projects, claims he rephrased recently.

""The tragedy is that even those who go to challenge government policies in our courts... that after they have obtained stays and injunctions, whether it is housing or universal healthcare coverage plan, they have the audacity and temerity to come and look for government officials telling them that 'if you talk to us nicely, we are going to remove the injunction',"" Ruto said recently.

Omtatah, who has previously faced threats owing to his public-interest litigation work, wondered why the president was making such claims.

""I don't know what the president knows or means. Since it takes two to tango, I don't know who approached whom. What matters to me is that I have not filed my petition. So I cannot be a suspect. Let the president shut up and defend the cases against the Affordable Housing Act,"" said Omtatah.

Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna also faulted the president's remarks. ""He needs to provide evidence of this blackmail. He has threatened people who have filed cases before and now he is turning around to allege things without evidence,"" said Sifuna.

The previous public feud prompted a meeting with Chief Justice Martha Koome to reduce hostilities between their arms of government.

While Ruto may have construed the truce to mean the courts would play ball, as he suggested that the Executive and Judiciary had agreed on his housing plan, Koome has insisted that her arm of government would remain independent.

""The Judiciary is not, in any capacity, able to enter into any agreement with the Executive, especially in a matter that is before court,"" Koome said on Thursday.

The president should have known that he was bound to face hurdles in court, having served as deputy president in a government that was constantly sued for alleged constitutional breaches.

University don Herman Manyora notes that while sustained litigation comes as no surprise to Ruto, the president is grappling with the reality that people would openly challenge him.

""From the way he speaks, he seems surprised that people have the guts to do what they are doing - that they can dare challenge him,"" says Manyora, who urges the Head of State to ""do the right thing"".

""He should follow the Constitution and maintain fidelity to the rule of law. He should appreciate that the 2010 Constitution grants citizens certain rights. Equally important, he should negotiate with different groups because politics is all about negotiations,"" he adds.

Ruto is also facing dissent outside the courts. For instance, the clergy has come out strongly to oppose certain government policies, issuing stinging statements against the housing levy and the high cost of living.

In recent months, many have predicted the ""return of the Church"", referencing the vocal role it played in championing democracy and respect for human rights during the 1980s and 1990s.

The public, too, is rallying together to oppose unfavourable policies. Avocado farmers in Mt Kenya region have recently opposed new taxes, forcing their leaders into a tactical retreat. Now the government has been forced to relook at the contentious clauses of the Finance Act which require farmers to issue tax receipts and pay a 5 per cent tax.

Across the country, many more are voicing their dissent against the high cost of living and government wastage, some through Bunge la Mwananchi forums even as others heckle during presidential functions. Ruto's response has been to sustain engagements with the masses.

And Azimio is also maintaining the pressure on the government. When Ruto said he supported former PM Raila Odinga to chair the African Union Commission, the expectation by many was that the opposition would go easy on him as it had when Raila shook hands with former President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Indeed, Ruto and Raila are believed to be in a secret arrangement and have the National Dialogue Committee (Nadco) report tying their interests. But the opposition has not gone slow on the government, calling them out at every turn. On Friday, National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi questioned Ruto's commitment to bringing to book those involved in the unfolding fertiliser scandal.

Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who co-chaired Nadco alongside National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wah, recently warned of a return of anti-government protests if the cost of living stayed high.

Manyora believes that Ruto is feeling the heat of all these factors, hence his strong reaction. ""If (the late former President Daniel) Moi felt the heat, who is he not to? He cannot be stronger than Moi,"" he said.",standardmedia.co.ke,news,Standard Digital News - Kenya,Brian Otieno,-0.08235294117647063,448924116,1,https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/iA285JVh7DhC1ZR2STrn0LnhXRt2c8ootzktxolj.jpg,

Russian oil is now starting to feel the impact of sanctions as tankers belonging to the state-owned Sovcomflot have ceased to deliver to all Indian refineries.

Dozens of vessels affected by sanctions have been unable to load cargoes, affecting Russia's oil export apparatus, which finances the Kremlin's activities in Ukraine.

While a sharp reduction in shipments is not expected at this stage, the extent to which Western regulators will tighten the screws remains uncertain, particularly as oil prices edge towards $90 per barrel.

The costs of shipping Russian oil are substantial. According to Argus Media, transporting cargo from the Baltic Sea to China costs around $14.50 per barrel, with more than half of this amount attributed to sanctions-related expenses.

Moreover, Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries are further denting Russia's profits.

Earlier reports indicated that approximately 600,000 barrels of daily refining capacity in Russia were disabled due to strikes by Ukrainian drones on Russian refineries.

""Thousands of ordinary people lost their savings,"" said prosecutors in the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried this week, urging the judge to enact the harshest possible punishment when the disgraced founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX is sentenced next week.

Bankman-Fried was convicted in November on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. Ahead of sentencing on March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan has received presentencing memorandums from both sides.

Prosecutors, seeking $11 billion in compensation and up to 50 years of imprisonment, say Bankman-Fried, ""driven by greed and hubris"" repeatedly gambled other people's money and that his education and privileged upbringing equipped him with the knowledge to know that he was acting illegally.

The defense lawyers maintain that FTX investors will eventually recover their money and have requested leniency from Kaplan, suggesting a sentence of between five and six years.

Drug Stock Pump-And-Dumper Fined $7.2 Million

The Securities and Exchange Commission, which civilly charged Kevin Dills and two entities he controlled with operating a fraudulent share scheme, obtained a final judgment in the case this week.

According to the SEC complaint, Dills allegedly paid Joseph Padilla to arrange sales of Oncology Pharma ONPH stock, a company secretly controlled by Dills.

The shares were sold through two other entities controlled by Dills, Bright Star International and Life Sciences Journeys, the SEC said.

The shares were being promoted while Dills allegedly used his controlling influence over Oncology Pharma, to have the company publish press releases to make its stock more appealing to investors.

The complaint alleged that Dills, by dividing his Oncology Pharma ownership between two front companies, transferring shares to Padilla, and then sharing in the proceeds of Padilla's illegal sales, purposely flouted the registration requirements of federal securities law.

Dills consented to a final judgment that permanently bars him from dealing in penny stocks. The judgment ordered Dills to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $6.2 million, and fees amounting to $1 million.

Executives attending the annual CERAWeek get-together in Houston expressed confidence that fossil fuel consumption would continue growing, just months after world leaders at the COP28 climate summit pledged to begin ""transitioning away from fossil fuels"" and triple the use of renewables by 2030.

""The environment right now is very positive for the oil and gas industry,"" Alan Armstrong, chief executive of Williams, the biggest US gas pipeline company, told the Financial Times.

""Roll the clock back four or five years ago, they were like: 'Oh, it's all going to be renewables and batteries' -- and now they're saying: 'Wow, wow, this is going to be way too expensive.'""

The bullish comments at the event -- which boasted a record attendance of more than 8,000 delegates -- came against a backdrop of record temperature rises and growing scientific concern over the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change.

The UN's World Meteorological Organization this week sounded a ""red alert"" as it affirmed 2023 as having been the hottest year on record. It pointed to unprecedented surface and ocean temperatures, glacial retreat and rising sea levels. Jim Skea, head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told an FT conference last week the world was in ""unknown territory"".

But industry leaders argue consumers are unwilling to pay the costs associated with a rapid shift to wind and solar energy. Booming construction of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres, population increases and sweeping electrification mean increases in all forms of energy, except coal, are needed to meet demand, they said.

Liam Mallon, head of ExxonMobil's upstream business, said that the ""brutal reality"" was that the world was ""not yet at a point where the big customers are willing to pay for the cost of this new energy and the consumers probably don't really know the cost of it"".

""Until such time as there is a market-based economy and everyone understands the cost of it, consumers are paying more than they need to be paying for energy -- simple, it's not that complicated,"" he said. ""You can argue green all day and NGOs all day, but those are the facts. I think that message is beginning to resonate.""

Industry heavyweight Shell last week weakened its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. BP, which dialled back its own climate targets last year, touted the potential to grow its oil and gas operations in the US's Permian Basin at the conference.

US oil and gas production have smashed fresh records in recent months and the country now pumps more than any other nation in history. Meanwhile, surging prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have propelled producers across the world to report record profits in the past two years.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and, instead, invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions,"" Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, told delegates to the conference this week.

But some renewable executives at the conference hit back at the fossil fuel narrative.

Sandhya Ganapathy, head of EDP Renewables North America, called the statements by oil and gas executives a ""limited"" view of the role renewables will play in the future.

Mark Hutchinson, chief executive of Fortescue Energy, responded to the comments from Aramco's Nasser by saying: ""The fantasy is that the oil and gas industry think that by putting more emissions in the world, it gets better.

""You have the oil and gas industry baring their teeth . . . now the world knows these guys are never going to be part of the solution.""

Yet oil and gas executives pointed to the need for dependable electricity to feed the soaring power demand sparked by the proliferation of data centres needed for AI.

The International Energy Agency anticipates global power consumption from data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt hours by 2026, more than double 2022 levels and an increase equivalent to Germany's total power use in the space of four years.

""These great things that civilisation is doing, the innovation that we're developing, depends on our industry to deliver them,"" said Toby Rice, chief executive of EQT, the biggest US natural gas producer.

""When we're talking about data centres, there's not going to be: 'Well let's do wind and let's do solar' -- this needs reliable, consistent power that can only be provided with hydrocarbons.""

Last year, the IEA predicted demand for oil and gas would peak before the end of the decade, a forecast that has been disputed by the Opec+ producers group and by many oil majors, who do not expect demand to peak until the 2030s or later.

The world is accelerating its deployment of renewables, adding 50 per cent more capacity in 2023 than the previous year, according to the IEA, with the faster growth expected in the next five years.

But the IEA faces a backlash from Big Oil and Republican supporters in the US Congress, with a group of lawmakers accusing the agency on Wednesday of adopting ""misguided and troubling"" positions on fossil fuels and straying from its core mission of promoting energy security.

A report released by Carbon Tracker this week found the world's biggest oil and gas companies still not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change, despite corporate messaging on supporting a low-carbon future.

Protesters outside the Houston event staged a mock ""funeral march"" as they blasted executives for pollution in Gulf communities and the industry's contribution to climate change.

""Our dependency on fossil fuels has been harming and killing and causing suffering for communities and people for decades,"" said James Hiatt, an activist from south-west Louisiana.

""We're at the precipice where we have got to shift if we don't want to inflict mass suffering on our children and their children.""",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,0.3568627450980393,448922333,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-03-24/l_1171576_012517_updates.jpg,eng-9409457

Awka, the capital city of Anambra State, is a place of many prospects, a feature it has continued to breathe out daily on its residents whose number increases on daily basis as the city itself advances towards a facelift. The city is also a place where dreams are bought and sold, as well as a melting pot of ambitions and aspirations. Amidst these throngs of traders, workers and other hustlers who make the capital city bustling, emerges a story that challenges one's perception of dreams and realities of life. This is the story of a young graduate, and a gifted mathematician, who circumstances of the day forced to resort to hawking palm oil as a means of livelihood.

The 32-year-old graduate of Electronic and Computer Technology from the University of Calabar, who hails from Umuahia in Abia State, has his story reflect and encapsulate the aspirations, struggles and the conditions of many young Nigerians today.

This reporter, Izunna Okafor, bumped into a young man around the popular UNIZIK Junction (also known as the UNIZIK Temp. Site) in Awka, where he was seen running to hand over a can of palm oil to a female passenger in a tricycle (Keke), who eventually threw out a cash of N1000 for him, as the tricycle continued its journey. A close observation shows the well-dressed young man as he returned to a spot where other cans palm oil were also seen, loaded in a white bucket, which he then settled on his head and began to trek down the axis. This moved this reporter to approach him for inquiries regarding what had just transpired and his destination with the bucket of oil on his head.

It was through the interaction that this reporter gathered that the young man, named Ugochukwu Friday Ebubedike, was actually carrying his stock and engaging in his struggle from which he makes a daily living. He hawks palm oil to survive, and he was actually trekking down to deliver some cans of palm oil to a customer who ordered them, alongside additional cans of the stock he might also sell to lucky buyers.

During the interaction, it was observed that Ebubedike was speaking good English, which made this reporter to inquire his educational background. And, surprisingly, he is a graduate of the University of Calabar, where he earned his degree in Electronic and Computer Technology in 2019.

This quite-unravelling conversation made this reporter to buy off the remaining two cans of oil Ebubedike had in his bucket (even when he had no immediate need for oil) for a continued and more relaxed discussion, after he accompanied him to supply the other cans of oil to the person who placed the order.

Further inquiries into Ebubedike's life and background revealed that he came from a family where education was a privilege, and not a right; hence, he clawed his way through school, juggling studies with odd jobs like selling shoes and other footwears, to make up life; and which he sustained till his graduation in 2019. He is the first son in the family of a local bus driver and a caterer, and had to begin early to struggle, so as to pave way for his two younger siblings, having understood the condition of the family better than everyone of them. However, upon graduation, the unfortunate situation of Nigeria hit him, as he found no better job to do.

In 2020, during the lockdown, a search for greener pasture forced him to relocate to Awka, to seek his fortune in Anambra. Upon his arrival in the city, he resumed his hustle by joining and assisting his friend who then newly launched a shoemaking brand, and from where he also began to sell footwears. He also used the opportunity to learn the skill and craft of shoemaking, but has no capital to venture into it.

When asked other hustles or opportunities he had ventured into to make the ends meet since he came to Awka, Ebubedike, who is also a gifted mathematician, said he had taught mathematics in some private schools, but ended up quiting after some time, because he was being paid a peanut, which did not match his input or reflect the changing economic realities of the country.

""I have taught in two different private schools, but the salaries could not even solve my basic needs, so I decided to quit. Currently, I teach in JAMB aspirants at a JAMB lesson centre and also do private/home lessons for students and pupils, most of whom knew me from the private schools where I earlier taught.

""I love molding young ones, and, to me, teaching is a gift. I also teach mathematics online. You can also visit my Facebook page and YouTube page @solving mathematics with ease, for more information,"" he said.

When asked how he ended up hawking palm oil, Ebubedike, who said he does his own palm oil business in a very decent, mature, and classic way, further explained that he launched into the business after a woman in Awka sought his assistance to get palm oil for her from his State, Abia, where she heard the price was cheaper.

""A woman I see as a mentor in Awka here asked me if I could get palm oil from my state for her, and also asked how much it would cost to do that -- a deal I ended up turning into an opportunity. I successfully transacted the business with her, and it 'worked', while I also made my profit. After that deal, she advised me to venture into the business. And that was how I began selling palm oil till today. This happened early this year, 2024,"" he narrated.

Concerning how he got the kick-off capital to launch into the business to the extent that he can now procure gallons of palm oil (though depending on his financial muscle) at once from Abia State and pays off, Ebubedike said it was a product of trust and agreement between him and one of his friends who saved her next session's school fees in his (Ebubedike's) account

According to him, ""A very good friend of mine gave me her school fee for the next session to keep for her in my account. So, I saw it as an opportunity after my discussion with the woman who advised me to start selling palm oil. So, I informed the friend, and she said there was no problem, and even encouraged and prayed for me to succeed in the business. Then, I added that to my little savings, and began the business immediately.""

Despite his academic background, his mathematical expertise and his passion for teaching, Ebubedike, due to condition, has embraced palm oil hawking as a means of survival, recognizing its stability and demand in the market. While the palm oil business has been his major sustainer, he currently combines the business with his private and JAMB mathematical classes (both online and offline), which hold at scheduled hours in the day, without any of them causing a decay to the other.

Notwithstanding the challenges involved, he finds a way to balance his palm oil business with his love for teaching. It was also gathered that many of his regular customers buy by placing order for him to supply, both in retail and in wholesales. He said from the little proceeds he makes, he takes care of himself and his family members, being the first son of the family.

When asked if he had applied for any of the government-provided opportunities that abound for people like him in Anambra State, such as the teachers recruitment exercise, the One Youth Two Skills initiative, and others; Ebubedike said he applied for the One Youth Two Skills, but his name was not shortlisted.

""As for the teachers recruitment, I applied and wrote the exam, but before I knew that applicants needed to also check their result by themselves while waiting for the shortlist, the link wasn't opening anymore. So, I am still hopeful that they will shortlist me when the names are out,"" he said.

Still full of optimism, the UNICAL graduate said he had never been ashamed of doing his palm oil business, as, according to him, anybody who wants to succeed in Nigeria today must first get rid of shame in any good thing he is doing to succeed.

""I am not ashamed at all. This is what keeps me alive and going on daily basis. So, why would I be ashamed of doing it? That is what the situation of the country has brought forth. So, we are in it already. And we only hope it would get better.""

Ebubedike, however, disclosed that many people (especially women and young girls) look down on him and ""rate"" him low, judging by the way they talk to him, because he sells palm oil, including those he assumes may not have written JAMB for the first time in their lives, let alone gaining admission and graduating, with all the stress and the financial implication involved. He, however, blames nobody for his fate and condition, still expressing optimism that things would be better some day, as no condition is permanent.

When asked the nature of assistance or support he needs now, Ebubedike said he needed higher capital to expand the business, adding that he had, in countless occasions, lost some of his customers because he had no money to buy the quantity of the oil they ordered or to procure and deliver it at the time they needed it.

He also expressed his dire need for a gainful employment, to enjoy the full benefit of his education; even as he equally expressed interest to further his studies, harping on his urgent need for sponsorship to enable him realize his full potential.

""Any way or anyhow anybody wants to help or support, I am open and thankful. People can reach me through +2348167760374 . I believe in myself that I have something to offer for the betterment of the society. But I have not been able to do that because I am being retarded by issues of life, occasioned by the condition of the country. And even to travel out is not easy. So, we had to stay back, because this is our country. And I believe different people have something to contribute to make it better. My brother, that is why you see me hustling in my own little and legit way, rather than creating more problem for the country that is also full of problem.

""My fellow youths should also embrace spirit of hustle, for those who have not.

And everyone knows that once a college bar has turned on you, let alone the oldest bar in Lexington, Kentucky - it's all downhill from there.

This past week, the Calipari-led Wildcats' Madness ended in just the first round, as No. 3 Kentucky was upset by No. 14 Oakland, 80-76. More telling, however, was that it was the second time that Kentucky has been bounced in the first round in the last three tournaments.

And now even the local bars are saying enough is enough, Cal.

In a hilariously new social media post, Lexington's oldest bar - the Chevy Chase Inn, has now released a shot called the 'FireCal.'

""Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Chevy Chase Inn, Lexington, Kentucky's oldest bar where we've been cheering on the Wildcats for over 90 years. Usually, this is when we're celebrating March Madness but once again this year we're celebrating March Sadness,"" the bartender begins.

""This year, we now have the FireCal shot because it just makes sense.."" He then pounds the shot of Fireball, aka FireCal whiskey, before nearly throwing it up and saying ""My God, it's almost as bad as Calipari's coaching!""

Boom. Fantastic delivery, sir! At least you came through, unlike Coach Cal.

As anyone who follows college sports knows - there's not a whole lot to do in Kentucky except drink and root for the Wildcats' basketball programs. Calipari has now taken one of those things from the Kentucky faithful's hearts and souls with his 1-4 record in his last 5 NCAA Tournament games.

Is it time for a new regime at Kentucky? According to the ever-so-reliant and always educated opinion of Twitter, many believe it's time for Calipari to leave.

It's not up to them though - it's up to the school, which would have to pay him a $34 million buyout.

The nine-seed Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team fought to the very end, but they came up short in the Round of 64 against the eight-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, 81-72, ending their season.

With jitters extremely high, both teams took a while to settle in. After two minutes of no scoring by either team, Laila Phelia and Zakiyah Franklin started getting a active for their respective teams. Phelia made the first basket of the game as the shot clock expired, but Franklin followed it up with a three-pointer. Two minutes later, Phelia drained two free throws and converted on a layup to score four straight, however, Franklin matched her yet again with a tough floater to tie the game at nine.

Michigan's Chyra Evans made a second-chance layup and Kansas' Taiyanna Jackson made one free throw, but Phelia was responsible for six of the Wolverines' 11 points at the end of the first quarter and Franklin tallied seven of the Jayhawks' 10.

In total, both teams shot extremely poorly out of the game, as Michigan went 4-for-14 from the field and had three turnovers in the opening quarter and Kansas was 4-for-11 with three turnovers as well.

The second quarter was nothing like the first, as both teams got into a scoring rhythm.

After making just one three in the first, Jayhawks' Wyvette Mayberry sank a corner three to start the second and Lauren Hansen matched her on the other end. Kansas' leading scorer, S'Mya Nichols, who averaged 15.2 points per game as a freshman, also got herself on the board with a converted and-one. Mayberry drilled another three immediately following that to put together a quick 6-0 run for the Jayhawks and led 19-14.

The Wolverines then went cold from the floor, making just one basket in four minutes, and Kansas added to its lead courtesy of a Ryan Cobbins three. Five minutes into the quarter, the Jayhawks led by six and were 4-for-8 from the arc.

For the next two minutes, however, the momentum shifted to Michigan. Jackson and Nichols each picked up two fouls, forcing them both to sit on the bench. Without their leading scorer and 6' 6"" center, the Wolverines put their own 8-0 run together behind Evans, Jordan Hobbs and Elissa Brett, taking a two-point lead with 3:07 remaining in the quarter.

Cobbins did her best to keep the deficit within one, but Phelia and Cameron Williams didn't miss their next few shots and Michigan ended the half converting on six of eight field goals to take a slim three-point lead into halftime.

The start of the second half mirrored the end of the first. Hansen got things started with a quick three on the opening possession to give Michigan a six-point lead, its largest lead of the game. One minute later, Williams made back-to-back layups for the Wolverines, increasing her total to 12 in just over a half. Jackson, who averages 12 points per game, tallied her first points of the game to cut the deficit a little, but Nichols picked up her third foul, sending herself back to the bench.

Franklin did her best to carry the Jayhawks offense, adding four more points to her total of 15, but Williams caught fire and could not miss, making six of her last seven shots for a seven-point Wolverines lead.

Holly Kersgieter sank a badly needed three for Kansas to cut the deficit to four, but Evans, Williams and Phelia kept the team's foot on the pedal, increasing the Michigan lead to nine at the buzzer to end the third quarter up 53-44.

With time running out, the Jayhawks tried to put together a late run.

Nichols started the final quarter with a layup and Kersgieter forced a steal which turned into a layup on the other end as well. In addition, Williams picked up her 4th personal foul with a game-high 18 points and had to sit for a few minutes.

Nonetheless, the Wolverines' offense did not falter and Hansen, Hobbs and Evans continued to make big shots to keep at an eight-point distance with just over five minutes remaining in regulation.

Kansas wasn't done battling, yet.

Out of the timeout, Jackson and Mayberry cut the deficit to four, putting together a small 6-0 run. Phelia pushed the lead back out to six on a layup, but Mayberry drained her third three-pointer of the game to cut the deficit to three.

With the momentum swinging towards the Jayhawks, Brett hit a big three to give Michigan some breathing room. Nichols and Jackson then forced Brett to pick up her fourth foul, making three of four free throw attempts, but Phelia made another tough bucket to maintain a five-point Wolverine lead with two minutes to go.

After another timeout, Jackson got into double figures with another layup, cutting the lead to three. Phelia then turned the ball over on back-to-back possessions, giving Franklin the chance to tie the game, 67-67, on a deep three that took four bounces to go into the basket.

Hansen heaved up a three at the buzzer that didn't go in and to overtime we went.

Ending the quarter on a 19-9 run, Kansas started overtime on a 5-0 run led by Jackson and Kersgieter. On the next possession, Williams picked up her fifth foul and had to sit for the rest of the game. She led the team with 18 points. Michigan continued to stay cold from the floor, going five minutes without a point until Hansen made a fade-away jumper with three minutes to go in the period, cutting the deficit to three. However, on the ensuing possession, Franklin eclipsed 20 points with a layup to maintain a five-point lead.

With just over a minute left, Hansen gave Michigan life with a three to close the gap back to three points, however, Nichols made a clutch basket and was fouled on the other end with 25 seconds to go, giving the Jayhawks a 78-72 lead.

Kansas made three more free throws, and defeated the Wolverines, 81-72, ending their season.

Williams finished her final game with 18 points and Phelia tallied 16 in the loss. Kansas was led by Franklin's 22 points, Jackson's 14 points and eight rebounds and Mayberry's 15.

Join us in this fight.

Russia's oil trade is starting to feel the pressure of Western sanctions as Indian refineries no longer accept tankers of Moscow's state-owned Sovcomflot shipping company, Bloomberg reported on March 23.

Following the sanctions imposed against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been seeking new markets for its fossil fuels. India has become a key buyer of Russian oil, second only to China.

Multiple tankers carrying Russian crude have been unable to land in Indian ports in recent months in connection to sanctions. According to Bloomberg, dozens of sanctioned vessels are now idling by in numbers not seen since 2017.

The U.S. has been tightening its restrictions against Russian oil since last October, sanctioning around 40 oil tankers involved in the trade. Russia's largest shipping company, Sovcomflot, came under fresh sanctions in February for violating the $60-per-barrel price cap.

Towards the end of 2023, Group of Seven (G7) countries vowed to step up enforcement of the price cap, first implemented in December 2022, after reports emerged that Russia has continued to ship out much of its crude above $60 per barrel by using a ""ghost fleet"" of mostly uninsured tankers.

Sovcomflot transported around one-fifth of all Russian crude deliveries to India in 2023, Bloomberg noted.

Rising challenges to Russia's oil industry, one of Moscow's key revenue sources, are compounded by Ukraine's drone attacks against the country's refineries. The U.K. Defense Ministry said that the drone strikes may have disrupted at least 10% of the country's refinery capacity.",kyivindependent.com,news,The Kyiv Independent,Martin Fornusek,-0.1686274509803921,448921558,1,https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg,ukr-235913

Reuters

When it comes to packaged food, Mumbai-based Raaginee Razdan is quite conscious about the product that she picks from the local supermarket store. Taking note of the nutritional information labelled on cereals, breads, pickles and other everyday items, she also looks at the ingredients like oil, sugar, salt or chillies commonly found in most processed food products like snacks and confectionery.

""After getting diagnosed with high cholesterol levels last year, I have been on a strict diet, as advised by my nutritionist. So, I use moderate amounts of different oils in cooking, but I have cut down on my intake of packaged foods, which contain a certain kind of vegetable oil that is not really healthy,"" says the 40-year-old homemaker.

The vegetable oil that Razdan is referring to is the edible palm oil widely used as an ingredient in many recipes -- in approximately 70% of packaged food products -- from biscuits to breads, chocolates to cookies, cakes, peanut butter, chips and more.

For instance, look at the packaging of bread brand Harvest Gold or other products like Maggie noodles, Haldiram's snacks, Parle-G biscuits, Vadilal and Cream Bell ice cream and frozen desserts, Godiva milk chocolate pearls, or even the baked cakes and frozen desserts from local confectioners, among many others, and you will find the use of edible vegetable or palm oil in all of them. The multipurpose and high-performance properties of palm oil like cooking or baking at high temperatures with a melting point of 95°F (35°C), which is significantly higher than the melting point of coconut oil (76°F/ 24°C), besides creamy texture and absence of smell, makes it a perfect and affordable ingredient for recipes. The food items that use palm oil can also be stored and processed for long-term use.

In fact, the consumption of processed snacks and bakery items from local vendors, bakers and food manufacturers that use low-grade-and-priced butter, creams, fats and oils extracted from vegetable fats and palm oil, has been very affordable for industrial use. And this constant consumption of palm oil in some processed and packaged food items in the long run has been associated with health hazards. Since it is made of 50% saturated fat, mainly palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, which is the principal constituent of refined palm oil, it increases blood LDL or 'bad' cholesterol levels, increasing cardiovascular disease risk. It is also packed with calories -- close to 135 calories per tablespoon. Mustard oil, in comparison, has 50.

When asked about the use of palm oil, its alternatives and some considerations regarding its consumption and production, experts say moderation is key.

Dr Ankur Gupta, consultant, internal medicine, Fortis Escorts, Okhla, Delhi, says, ""Moderation is key to all oils, but palm oil is calorie-dense, so excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain if not balanced with physical activity and other aspects of a healthy diet. It is higher in saturated fat than many other vegetable oils. High intake of saturated fats can increase levels of LDL cholesterol, which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Palm oil is commonly used in processed foods, where it may be found in high amounts along with other unhealthy ingredients like added sugars and refined carbohydrates. Thus, consuming excessive amounts of processed foods containing palm oil can contribute to poor diet quality and associated health issues like obesity and chronic diseases.""

Gupta says avoiding palm oil entirely can be challenging since it is prevalent in many processed foods and consumer products. ""The best is to reduce the intake by checking labels. Opt for whole, minimally processed foods, whenever possible. Fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds generally do not contain palm oil. Cooking from scratch allows you to have better control over the ingredients you use. So, choose products from companies that are committed to using sustainably sourced palm oil or offer transparent information about their sourcing practices. Look for certification labels such as RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) to ensure that the palm oil used meets certain environmental and social standards,"" adds Gupta.

While there is no specific minimal quantity of palm oil for consumption, Pratiksha Kadam, consultant, dietitian, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Navi Mumbai, recommends consuming fats/ oils in moderation as part of a balanced diet. This typically ranges from 20-35% of total daily calories with emphasis on unsaturated fats. For most people, this translates to about 2-3 tablespoons (30-45 ml) of healthy fats/oils per day, spread throughout meals. ""Studies have found that some processing methods for palm oil led to the formation of contaminants, such as 3-MCPD (a contaminant first identified in acid-hydrolysed vegetable proteins and soy sauce), which have potential health risks. At the same time, moderate consumption of palm oil as part of a balanced diet may not pose significant health risks for most individuals,"" says Kadam.

For those with health conditions like heart disease or high cholesterol, Kadam says they should be more cautious and may limit or avoid palm oil. ""It's important to balance palm oil intake with other healthier fats and maintain an overall healthy nutritious diet. Consulting a nutritionist or doctor for professional advice is recommended,"" says Kadam.

Cultivating a disaster

Palm oil has a greater yield at a lower cost of production than other vegetable oils, and the global production and demand for palm oil is also increasing. Oil plantations have spread across tropical areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America which are important habitats for endangered species. So, does palm oil have an environment-friendly production and sourcing?

Palm oil has been leading to unsustainable production and has been directly linked to the destruction of precious habitat. With high demand for palm oil, the impact has been alarming on wildlife.

Palm oil logging and mining, slash and burn technique, drainage of peat swamps -- all of these have affected the habitat of orangutans of Borneo and Sumatra and the tiger habitat in Malaysia.

As oil palm is mostly grown in areas that get lots of rain, especially in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Cameroon, where governments cleared forests for plantation, the plant has triggered massive deforestation, destroying habitats of endangered species like orangutans and reducing planetary resilience to climate change.

Oil palm, a tropical, perennial crop mainly cultivated for its vegetable oil, is extracted from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit. The oil palm tree produces high-quality oil used primarily for cooking in developing countries, besides its usage in food products, detergents, cosmetics and, to a small extent, biofuel.

Even as many brands like Nestle, General Mills and Cargill are committed to responsible sourcing of palm oil, there is a global partnership called The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) that was established in 2004 to promote the growth and use of sustainable palm oil products through global standards and multi-stakeholder governance.

On the other hand, India is both the world's largest consumer as well as the biggest importer of palm oil. Under the National Mission for Edible Oil -- Oil Palm launched in 2021, the Centre is aiming to raise the domestic production, proposed to cover an additional area of 6.5 lakh hectare (ha) for oil palm till 2025-26 and thereby reaching the target of 10 lakh hectare ultimately. The production of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) is expected to go up to 11.20 lakh tonne by 2025-26 and up to 28 lakh tonne by 2029-30. A report published in FE quoted an agriculture ministry official on the plan to increase total area under palm by several companies including Godrej Agrovet, Patanjali Food and 3F Oil Palm Agrotech to 0.65 MH in the next 5-6 years from the current level of 0.3 MH.

According to the Solvent Extractors' Association of India, the country's import of palm, soybean and sunflower oils rose 17% to a record 16.47 MT (valued at '1.38 trillion) in the 2022-23 oil year (November-October) on year, owing to a fall in global prices and low import duty. Palm oil imports, mostly from Indonesia and Malaysia, constitute around 59% of the total edible oil imports. In domestic output, mustard has a share of 40%, soybean 24%, and groundnut 7%.

Be oil wise

Read labels

In many countries, food labelling regulations require manufacturers to list the ingredients used in their products. Look for palm oil specifically listed in the ingredient list. It may be listed under alternative names such as palm kernel oil, palm fruit oil, or vegetable oil. If a product claims to be free from palm oil, check the label carefully to confirm

Look for certification

Sustainable palm oil certification schemes, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification, aim to promote the production and use of palm oil that meets certain environmental and social standards. Look for products labelled with RSPO certification or other credible sustainability certifications to ensure that the palm oil used has been sourced responsibly

Research the brand

If unsure about the palm oil used in a particular product, consider researching the brand or manufacturer to learn more about their sourcing practices and commitment to sustainability

""The pressing concerns surrounding foreign exchange losses, OMC margins, sales tax, smuggling of Iranian diesel, infrastructure development cess, and the revision of the price mechanism have pushed this vital industry to the brink of collapse,"" the association said in a letter to the petroleum minister, Musadiq Malik.

The oil body said the sector's financial stability has been disrupted, and balance sheets bear the weight of these challenges with each passing day. ""As a result, our credit lines have been severely impacted, making it increasingly challenging to conduct business with financial institutions. The stringent requirements imposed by banks have forced us to transition from the green list to the gray list.""

The OMAP stated that banks are not increasing the LCs limits for OMCs since these LCs limits are in rupees and, due to the increase in the exchange rate and international oil prices, the OMCs require an immediate increase in their approved limits.

""With conditions continuing to deteriorate, we are on the brink of moving from the gray list to the black list, which could prove catastrophic for the industry,"" it added.

The letter pointed out that, as per the existing policy, ex-refinery prices of motor gas and high-speed diesel are determined on a fortnightly basis. ""However, this mechanism has serious flaws, such as a lack of visibility regarding the benchmark tenure of LCs, unclear exchange rates used to calculate ex-refinery prices, and a few others.""

It proposed the implementation of a pool system to compensate OMCs for their verifiable foreign currency losses, a measure that would promote sustainability and fairness within the industry.

The OMAP drew attention to a significant disparity in the premiums applicable to Pakistan State Oil (PSO) compared with those available to other oil marketing companies.

""It's crucial to highlight that PSO's cargo volumes surpass those of its OMC counterparts due to its substantial market share.

This scale has enabled PSO to secure lower premiums compared to what other OMCs receive. This disparity has placed the industry at a disadvantage.""

""An analysis of the situation concerning Mogas reveals that an OMC with an average cargo size experienced a net loss of $2.30 per barrel over the last eight months of 2023 versus the premium secured by PSO. This translates to a substantial loss of Rs4.27 per liter, representing a staggering 71 percent of the prevailing OMC margin. OMAP also sought an upward revision in OMCs' margins.""

The gas cloud is unlikely to cause any serious health problems. However, it could impact the ozone hole above the Arctic, experts warn.

On March 16, an underground volcano in Icealnd's Reykjanes Peninsula blew its top for the fourth time in as many months, opening up the largest fissure of the current eruption cycle and unleashing a massive lava flow that narrowly missed the evacuated town of Grindavík. There were initially fears that the lava flow could reach the sea and unleash a plume of hydrochloric acid, which would have been ""life-threatening"" to anyone close to the coastline, Live Science previously reported. However, the lava never reached the shore.

But the eruption did release sulfur dioxide -- a colorless, toxic gas that can be extremely dangerous in high concentrations.

On March 17, the volcano was spitting out around 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of sulfur dioxide every second, according to a translated statement from the Icelandic Met Office. Workers at the nearby Svartsengi power plant were evacuated from the facility due to high levels of the gas, Icelandic news site RÚV reported, and locals were temporarily warned to stay inside, according to Iceland's Civil Protection.

Sulfur dioxide emissions have diminished significantly since March 18, but new data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) -- part of the European Union's Copernicus program, which tracks weather and climate changes using satellite data -- shows that the initial outpouring of gas formed a 3-mile-tall (5 kilometers) concentrated column that has since blown toward other countries in northern Europe.

The gas plume has already passed above the U.K. and is currently approaching Scandinavia, where it will begin to dissipate before entering Russia.

CAMS will continue to track the plume ""although we don't expect there to be any impact on surface air quality or climate,"" senior CAMS scientist Mark Parrington said in a statement emailed to Live Science.

However, tracking sulfur dioxide emissions is still important because the gas can react with atmospheric ozone molecules, depleting the amount of this protective substance in the ozone layer, which shields Earth's surface from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

In October 2023, scientists partially attributed the near-record-largest ozone hole above Antarctica to the 2022 eruption of an underwater volcano in Tonga, which released high levels of water vapor into the atmosphere that may have depleted ozone levels.

Experts predict that the recent eruptions in Iceland could be the beginning of a new centuries-long period of activity in the region. As a result, the amount of sulfur dioxide being pumped toward the Arctic could also rise over the next few years, which could lead to larger northern ozone holes in the future.

The rules still need to overcome opposition by another state agency.

They were approved Thursday by the board of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, despite a late objection from the state Department of Finance because of cost effects on the state, the Los Angeles Times reported.

There is no federal heat standard in the United States. California has had heat protection rules for outdoor work such as agriculture and construction since 2006. But tackling indoor heat protections has taken years since the state passed legislation in 2016 to draft standards for indoor workers.

The proposed regulations would apply to workplaces ranging from warehouses to schools and kitchens, requiring cooling devices, access to water and cooling-off break areas at certain temperature thresholds as well as monitoring for signs of heat illness.

Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, applauded the vote and said 15 million workers in the state stand to benefit.

""The hottest years on record have occurred in the last 10 years. That means the danger of working in high heat has become more acute in the time it has taken to finalize these standards,"" Kaoosji said in a statement.

California experienced an e-commerce-driven boom in the construction of massive warehouses for companies such as Amazon. Concerns about heat illnesses have been repeatedly raised by workers in the industry.

Amazon said in a statement that its heat safety protocols often exceed industry standards, and it provides air conditioning in all of its fulfillment centers and air hubs.

The Department of Finance sought to halt the Cal/OSHA board's vote, citing concerns about huge costs to correctional and other facilities.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, told the Times the impact ""could be in the neighborhood of billions of dollars.""

The state Office of Administrative Law will need the Department of Finance's approval before it can move forward with the regulations, Palmer said.

Palmer also said the Department of Finance only received some of the data involving the regulations in February.

""This was a decision that was driven by our inability to do our fiscal due diligence and evaluate this data late in the process that had a potential impact to the state,"" he said.

Labor and climate activists opposed the effort to remove the heat-protection item from Thursday's meeting agenda, and board Chair David Thomas agreed.

""There's no reason this shouldn't be passed in my mind, because they are right that their lives are the ones that are on the line,"" Thomas said.",siliconvalley.com,news,Silicon Valley,Associated Press,0.1843137254901961,448920525,1,https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/California_Workers_Indoor_Heat_70379.jpg?w=640,

""We're reducing both water quantity and water quality,"" says Katrina Moser, an associate professor from Western University's department of geography and environment. ""Some places are having a bigger impact on quality. Some places, we're having a bigger impact on quantity. But that double whammy is going to really affect water availability to us moving into the future.""

While our planet is covered in water, 97 per cent of it is salty, with only three per cent as freshwater found in glaciers, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and underground aquifers. It is vital to support our environment, our food and our health.

Canada is home to 20 per cent of the world's fresh water. But less than half of that is accessible, and an even smaller fraction is available to the bulk of Canadians living near the southern border.

""How fortunate we are in Canada to have so much fresh water. And I think we often take that for granted,"" said Moser.

""And so with that incredible fortune [and] privilege, also comes the responsibility to protect that water.""

Altering the water cycle beyond recognition

A recent study out of Finland analyzing freshwater resources around the globe found that humans have been pushing freshwater systems far beyond the stable conditions they need to function normally.

""We really should start to see the global water cycle for what it is. It's a global, crucial aspect of the Earth system that we all depend on,"" said Miina Porkka, an associate professor from the University of Eastern Finland, who led the study. ""All life on Earth depends on that. And so it is our shared responsibility,""

The water cycle is the process by which water evaporates off of land and ocean, is stored in the atmosphere and comes down to Earth as precipitation. It then filters through lakes, rivers, or groundwater systems, and then eventually is evaporated up into the atmosphere again.

But, Porkka said, humans have been altering it with dams, large scale irrigation systems, deforestation and the removal of wetlands, so the conditions that are required for the ecosystem to function normally are no longer being met.

""We know that ecosystems have adapted to specific variability.""

""You may start having serious ecological impacts, serious impacts on the cycling of water itself, and that could then turn into serious ecological impacts elsewhere, not just in that current region.""

And of course, there's the effect of climate change.

After a record-breaking warm winter, most of Canada experienced a deficit of snow, according to David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.

""Whatever [snow] people got didn't stay because it was so warm. From a water resource standpoint, you want it to stay, and instead it melted away,"" said Phillips.

Snow acts as a reservoir, slowly releasing water through the spring and early summer. This melt provides water for more than one billion people worldwide. But a warmer climate is changing how that process works.

""The snow is warmer, the temperature at which it's falling is warmer, and then you have constant air temperatures that are warmer,"" said Christina Aragon, a PhD student at Oregon State University. ""Snowpacks aren't functioning as natural reservoirs to the degree that they were in our past.""

In a recent study, Aragon and her colleagues found a 22 per cent decrease in the amount of water being stored in snowpacks in the mountains of the United States over the past 40 years.

""As a water researcher, I think it is pretty discouraging, but highly motivating for taking action on climate change,"" said Aragon.

Less water downstream, combined with warmer temperatures, can lead to drought, wildfires and water quality issues with the water that remains.

""When we remove ice cover, we give more time for water to evaporate,"" said Katrina Moser from Western University. ""We can see lake levels decrease and salinity increase. And if you change salinity even a tiny bit, that can have profound impacts on the organisms that are living in those lakes.""

But the effects of climate change vary from place to place, she says, even within Canada. While the Prairies and west coast are experiencing less precipitation, precipitation in Ontario is expected to increase, which could lead to flooding, increased erosion, and nutrient runoff. This, in turn, could lead to harmful algae blooms developing in the Great Lakes.

Groundwater declines but with a ray of hope

While most of the world's freshwater is locked up in glaciers, the largest quantity of available freshwater can be found buried below the surface.

""Groundwater is everywhere under your feet on the landscape. At some depth, if you started digging, you would reach groundwater everywhere on Earth,"" said Scott Jasechko, associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management.

Groundwater is a crucial resource for our planet; 10 million Canadians rely on groundwater for drinking water. It also supplies nearly half of the water used for irrigation projects around the world.

People walk along the receded shoreline of Alouette Lake in B.C. The lake is a B.C. Hydro reservoir, where water is regularly diverted to generate power, but in recent years drought-like conditions have threatened energy supply and animal habitats. (Ben Nelms/CBC)

But this high demand makes groundwater the world's most extracted raw material; 70 per cent of global groundwater withdrawals are used for agriculture, whether that be for growing food, industrial crops, or growing livestock.

For a recent study, Jasechko and colleagues looked at groundwater levels in almost 1,700 aquifers in more than 40 countries, and analyzed how the water levels were changing over time. They found that -- in most of the aquifers -- groundwater levels were declining faster than the water cycle could replenish them.

And while the researchers didn't see significant declines in Canadian groundwater, Jasechko said Canadians still aren't off the hook.

""Demand for that groundwater can be driven by international markets,"" he said. ""Canada imports about $5 billion of food from California alone every year. And that demand for food leads to groundwater pumping in California, and we're seeing some rapid rates of groundwater level decline in California.""

However, several of the aquifers weren't declining, and in fact had shown signs of recovery.

""We did find some rare cases where groundwater levels were declining in the 1980s and '90s and have recovered in the 21st century. These cases are rare, but I think they provide illustrative examples of how we can make things better.""

These examples include policy changes, redirecting of water, and infrastructure projects called leaky lakes, which are lakes purposefully built to collect water to feed aquifers.

Ultimately, Jasechko said he wants people at both the governmental level and individual level to be more conscientious about groundwater usage.

""The big lesson that we can take away from this is that groundwater depletion is not an inevitability,"" he said. ""Humans have agency, and there are interventions we can put in place to turn things around and fix this problem.""",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1215686274509804,448919893,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/B47kohmPLJZ_pJtFZZP0hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/55e84a54e3ba13b2d3e2700c7a280c24,eng-9412856

Last year, the New York Giants handed starting quarterback Daniel Jones a four-year contract extension worth $160 million. But Jones endured another difficult season before suffering a season-ending ACL tear in Week 9 against the Las Vegas Raiders.

The Giants met with McCarthy last week, according to Bleacher Report's Jordan Schultz.

But as rumors as of New York potentially selecting McCarthy heat up, head coach Brian Daboll provided some clarity on the team's QB plans while speaking to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero at Saturday's Annual League Meeting:

""We're excited to have Drew (Lock), and he knows what his role is going to be. He's going to get a lot of reps this spring, he needs to learn our system, but again excited to get Daniel back, when he gets back he'll be the guy.""

USC's Caleb Williams is a virtual lock to go first overall to the Chicago Bears at No. 1. With the No. 2 selection, the Washington Commanders will go with either LSU's Jayden Daniels or North Carolina's Drake Maye.

Whether the New England Patriots keep or trade the No. 3 pick, whoever remains between Daniels and Maye will likely go next. So McCarthy, the consensus No. 4 QB in this year's class, could very well be within reach for the New York Giants at No.6.

JJ McCarthy Makes Sense For The New York Giants

Unlike Williams and Daniels, McCarthy probably isn't ready to start right away. That's why he would be an ideal fit for the New York Giants if they weren't sold on ""Danny Dimes"" as the long-term option at QB.

With the structure of his contract, the Giants can get out of Jones' deal after next season. So they could theoretically draft McCarthy and have him play behind Jones and/or Drew Lock as a rookie next season before giving the Michigan product the reins in 2025.

In his final season at Michigan, McCarthy completed 72.3 percent of pass attempts for 2,991 passing yards and 22 touchdowns against only four interceptions.

If you're looking for a word to sum up this year's CERAWeek by S&P Global, try this one: demand.

Whether they were discussing oil, gas, power or renewables, speakers at the giant Houston talkfest were optimistic about consumption.

Any debate about energy these days is often presented as a choice between fossil fuels and low-carbon alternatives, but it's becoming clear that right now the world needs all of the above.

In part, that's about economic growth. The US appears to be in rude health, and President Joe Biden's push for reindustrialization is energy-hungry. India is expanding rapidly, and even China, where the property sector remains troubled, looks better than feared.

Take oil. Less than three months into 2024 and demand expectations are already being revised higher, helping drive a modest rally in prices.

""The US economy, in particular, has surprised to the upside,"" Saad Rahim, Trafigura Group's chief economist, said in an interview. ""Oil demand is performing better than expectations.""

But it's power that really dominated the conversations at the Hilton Americas-Houston hotel.

The energy transition was always going to be electricity-heavy as people trade internal combustion engines for EVs and swap gas boilers for heat pumps. But the artificial intelligence revolution potentially adds rocket fuel to demand.

One eye-popping forecast touted this week: By 2030, the surge in AI means US data centers may gobble up more power than households.

Despite the boom in solar power, it's unlikely renewables can handle that. At the very least, that means existing fossil-fuel generators stay online longer and more gas-fired output probably will be required in the US and elsewhere.

""With this huge revolution around artificial intelligence, I think the energy needs are going to be enormous,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told the conference.

Getting carbon out of the world's energy supply by midcentury was always a tall order, but the buoyant demand outlook across all parts of the system today shows just how hard that's going to be.

Key CERAWeek takeaways

Big Oil presented a confident front in Houston. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser set the tone Monday by forecasting years of rising fossil-fuel consumption while knocking the energy transition.

The oil market appears to be tighter than forecast at the start of the year. And there was genuine concern about the impact on fuel supplies from drone strikes on Russian refineries.

Exxon Mobil Corp. boss Darren Woods said he has no plans to elbow aside Chevron Corp. and buy Hess Corp. But questions remain about the Exxon-Chevron dispute over Guyana.

By ensuring that all valid BNB, BAKE, and CAKE holders receive their refunds promptly, BakerySwap has taken a significant step towards reinforcing its reputation as a reliable and user-centric DEX. The conversion of BNB to wBNB (wrapped BNB) is a technical necessity, given the operational mechanics of the blockchain and smart contracts. However, the platform has assured users that converting wBNB back to BNB is a straightforward process, maintaining a 1:1 conversion ratio to ensure no value is lost during the refund process.

The announcement also sheds light on the role of IQ50 in the presale and its subsequent responsibility in the refund process. IQ50's commitment to initiating refunds within the next 48 hours is a crucial part of the broader effort to ensure that all participants are made whole following the presale's resolution. This coordinated approach between BakerySwap and IQ50 demonstrates a collaborative effort within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to address and rectify issues swiftly, maintaining the integrity of the investment process for all parties involved.

The successful completion of refunds for the PUMP presale by BakerySwap, followed by IQ50's impending refund process, serves as a significant event within the cryptocurrency community. It highlights the importance of accountability and responsiveness by platforms and entities involved in the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto market. For investors and participants, this development reinforces the need for diligence and the importance of engaging with platforms that prioritize user security and trust.

Moreover, the event underscores the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where mechanisms such as presales and token distributions are continually being refined to enhance fairness, transparency, and security for investors. As the market matures, the expectation for swift and equitable resolutions to issues, such as those demonstrated by BakerySwap and IQ50, will likely become the standard, shaping the future conduct of platforms and projects within the space.

As BakerySwap and IQ50 move forward from the PUMP presale refunds, the cryptocurrency community will be watching closely to see how these platforms and others learn from this experience. The ability to effectively manage and resolve such challenges is crucial for the long-term sustainability and growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. For participants, the incident serves as a reminder of the inherent risks and the importance of engaging with reputable and responsive platforms.

BakerySwap's completion of the PUMP presale refunds marks a positive outcome for all parties involved, demonstrating the platform's dedication to its users' interests. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, such instances of accountability and transparency will play a pivotal role in shaping the trust and reliability of DeFi platforms and the broader crypto ecosystem.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.4039215686274509,448918870,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, has said the vision of President Tinubu is to create an enabling environment where businesses can thrive through streamlining regulations, investment incentives, provision of infrastructure, and robust policies aimed at fostering economic stability and prosperity.

The Minister stated this in Kano on Friday at a town hall meeting with the Business Community at the Bristol Hotel.

""As part of the Ease of Doing Business, the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has been mandated to operate a 24-hour online registration timeline for new businesses.

""To ensure that Nigeria retains more foreign exchange from its exports, the Export Permit application process is being revised and automated. Intending exporters will now have to show genuine proof of formal repatriation of export proceeds before new export licenses and permits are granted,"" he said.

Idris said the reconstituted Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC), is working closely with State Governments to eliminate the bottlenecks businesses face in Nigeria.

The Minister said the new Executive Order signed by the President will unlock the huge potential of the nation's oil and gas industry by bringing down operating costs for oil and gas operations in Nigeria, which currently stands at 40% - higher than the global average and compressing oil and gas contracting cycle from 38 months to 6 months.

""It will generate a billion cubic feet per day additional gas supply, create 2.3 million jobs, and boost GDP by $17 Billion. The new tax incentives being implemented have the potential to attract up to $10 Billion in new oil and gas investment,"" he said.

He said through enhanced security measures across the Niger Delta Region, the country's NLNG cargoes have increased from an average of 16 cargoes in 2023 to 21 cargoes in the first quarter of 2024, while crude oil production has risen from 1.22 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2023 to 1.6 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2024.

Idris said in a deliberate effort to boost Industrialization, the Federal Government issued import Duty Exemption Certificate (IDEC) letters of recommendation to 20 manufacturers for expansion and enhanced production capacity, as the Presidential Council on Industrial Revitalisation is currently working on the framework to implement a well-structured and functioning consumer credit system in line with global best practices.

""The Federal Government is reconstituting the National Trade Facilitation Committee, which convenes various relevant agencies and private sector representatives (under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment), to resolve and remove administrative and operational bottlenecks facing domestic and external trade in the country,"" he said.

The Minister also reeled out the post-subsidy interventions for the business community to include approval for the release of 200 Billion Naira for the Presidential Business Grants and Loans Schemes; 50 Billion Naira Presidential Conditional Grant Scheme (PCGS) for traders, food vendors, transport workers, ICT businesses, creatives, and artisans, as part of interventions to cushion the effect of the removal of petrol subsidies; the 75 Billion Naira FGN MSME Intervention Fund with single-digit-interest loans to MSMEs and the 75 Billion Naira FGN Manufacturing Sector Fund targeting manufacturing businesses, with selected beneficiaries eligible to access up to 1 Billion Naira each.

On the provision of critical infrastructure, the Minister gave the assurance the President is working assiduously to break the jinx in the power sector through the implementation of various policies including the speeding up of the injection of 12,000MW of electricity into the national grid in partnership with the Siemens Energy of Germany, the release of N40 billion for Mass Metering Program across the country among others.

""Work has commenced on the development of a new 20mw on-grid solar-hydro project, in Shiroro, Niger State, near the 600mw Shiroro Hydroelectric Power Plant. This 20mw plant is the first phase of a 300mw project,"" he said.

He said the macroeconomic policies of the President have begun to bear fruits through the sustained appreciation of the Naira, stability in the economy, and the clearing of the foreign exchange backlog of $7 billion by the Central Bank.

The Minister said the removal of the petrol subsidy was at the core of the President's economic reforms and it has started yielding positive results with the marked reduction in petrol importation to 50 percent monthly - roughly a billion liters a month - since the petrol subsidy was removed in June 2023.

Speaking at the event, the Chairman, of Kano Business Community, Alhaji Sabiu Bako, commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for implementing some of the suggestions they made while he was on the campaign trail to Kano.

He said the Kano Business community wholeheartedly supports the removal of fuel subsidy as it only benefited the upper class and did very little to alleviate the economic burden faced by the majority of Nigerians.

Months of attacks in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi militants following the Israel-Hamas war have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa, and stoked fears that the war could spread to destabilise the wider Middle East.

The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and they will not stop until Israel ends the war and withdraws from the enclave.

The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and redesignated the militia as a terrorist group.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. - Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.",ksat.com,news,KSAT,Associated Press,0.01960784313725483,448918356,1,"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/YTRALM6APNDUTGINV5SN4MLO6M.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0",

In a recent development that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community, BakerySwap, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX), has completed the process of issuing refunds to participants of the PUMP presale. This move relieves holders of BNB, BAKE, and CAKE tokens who had previously engaged in the presale, ensuring that their investments are returned in full.

The announcement also highlighted an important note regarding BNB refunds, which have been processed in the form of wBNB, albeit with a straightforward option for conversion back to BNB at a one-to-one ratio. Furthermore, IQ50, another entity involved in the presale, is set to begin its refund process within the next 48 hours, marking the next step in resolving the presale's aftermath.

BakerySwap ensuring a smooth refund process

BakerySwap's decision to refund presale participants underscores the platform's commitment to maintaining trust and transparency within its user base. By ensuring that all valid BNB, BAKE, and CAKE holders receive their refunds promptly, BakerySwap has taken a significant step towards reinforcing its reputation as a reliable and user-centric DEX. The conversion of BNB to wBNB (wrapped BNB) is a technical necessity, given the operational mechanics of the blockchain and smart contracts. However, the platform has assured users that converting wBNB back to BNB is a straightforward process, maintaining a 1:1 conversion ratio to ensure no value is lost during the refund process.

The announcement also sheds light on the role of IQ50 in the presale and its subsequent responsibility in the refund process. IQ50's commitment to initiating refunds within the next 48 hours is a crucial part of the broader effort to ensure that all participants are made whole following the presale's resolution. This coordinated approach between BakerySwap and IQ50 demonstrates a collaborative effort within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to address and rectify issues swiftly, maintaining the integrity of the investment process for all parties involved.

Implications for the cryptocurrency community

The successful completion of refunds for the PUMP presale by BakerySwap, followed by IQ50's impending refund process, serves as a significant event within the cryptocurrency community. It highlights the importance of accountability and responsiveness by platforms and entities involved in the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto market. For investors and participants, this development reinforces the need for diligence and the importance of engaging with platforms that prioritize user security and trust.

Moreover, the event underscores the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where mechanisms such as presales and token distributions are continually being refined to enhance fairness, transparency, and security for investors. As the market matures, the expectation for swift and equitable resolutions to issues, such as those demonstrated by BakerySwap and IQ50, will likely become the standard, shaping the future conduct of platforms and projects within the space.

As BakerySwap and IQ50 move forward from the PUMP presale refunds, the cryptocurrency community will be watching closely to see how these platforms and others learn from this experience. The ability to effectively manage and resolve such challenges is crucial for the long-term sustainability and growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. For participants, the incident serves as a reminder of the inherent risks and the importance of engaging with reputable and responsive platforms.

Conclusion

BakerySwap's completion of the PUMP presale refunds marks a positive outcome for all parties involved, demonstrating the platform's dedication to its users' interests. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, such instances of accountability and transparency will play a pivotal role in shaping the trust and reliability of DeFi platforms and the broader crypto ecosystem.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Haseeb Shaheen,0.388235294117647,448917292,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DALL·E-2024-03-24-00.08.25-Create-a-detailed-and-specific-representation-of-the-cryptocurrency-refund-process-emphasizing-clarity-and-the-smooth-flow-of-transactions.-Imagine-a.webp,

As the Miami Heat lost to the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night, it was off the back of a poor shooting performance, especially from three-point range. On the laundry list of injuries, one key player that the Heat are very much so missing is Duncan Robinson who elevates the team with his exceptional skill from deep, but is out with a back injury as he provides an update on the issue.

Robinson has missed the last two games with the aforementioned back injury that was later specified as ""left facet syndrome."" He left in the third quarter of the Heat's loss to the Philadelphian 76ers on March 18 due to back discomfort and went back home to see a back specialist as he said Friday evening that he is ""improving a lot"" and feels much better than he did last Monday according to Barry Jackson of The Miami Herald.

""Definitely [getting] better, significantly better than Monday,"" Robinson said of how he feels with the injury. ""It's improving a lot.""

Before the 76ers game, Robinson and Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra revealed that the star had trouble even moving his body, but wanted to play that night to be with his teammates. The 29-year old player recently made history on March 17 against the Detroit Pistons where on top of scoring 30 points, he became the fastest player in NBA history to reach 1000 made three-point shots in 343 games.

Robinson reveals how he feels with the injury

Fortunately for the Heat, Robinson bluntly said that the injury is ""not too serious"" as he is averaging 13.5 points, three assists, and 2.6 rebounds per game while shooting 45.8 percent from the field and 40.5 percent from three-point range. While Robinson wants to be out there for the team's last 13 games of the regular season, he said ""you want to be smart about it"" in terms of not just rushing through the injury.

""Thankful it's not too serious,"" Robinson said. ""Big thing is making sure [to] calm it down. It's flared up right now. I'm trying to play as soon as I possibly can. Itching to be back out there. As soon as get the clear and OK, I'll be back out there. Taking a couple days helps a lot. The recovery and treatment has helped as well as other things.

""You want to be smart about it,"" Robinson continued. ""I understand down the stretch there is going to be some managing of it from a pain perspective, which I'm ready to embrace, but you don't want to rush back to where it just flares up to where it starts [process] from day one.""

Spoelstra had brief update on Robinson

Before Friday's game against New Orleans, Spoelstra provided a brief update on Robinson saying that the Heat will be monitoring how his body responds to various treatment being received. However, the dynamic three-point shooter will be treated as ""day-to-day"" moving forward.

""Always optimistic,"" Spoelstra said. ""He'll be day to day and we'll see how his body responds after all the treatment today and tomorrow we'll see what's going on.""

Robinson missed based on Heat's loss to Pelicans Friday

Robinson was sorely missed Friday night as the Heat were poor in their three-point shooting as they were 27.7 percent from deep, missing 34 attempts which is the most this season and the fifth-most in the franchise's history. Even star Bam Adebayo said after the game that they are missing the likes of Robinson and other injured players who can space the floor like Tyler Herro and Kevin Love.

""A lot,"" Adebayo answered with how much the Heat miss their injured players. ""Just because they play heavy minutes for us, you can't replace a guy like Duncan [Robinson]who shoots it from anywhere, a guy like Tyler [Herro] who can create his own shot, and obviously the leadership of K-Love [Kevin Love].""

Next chance to play for Robinson in the Heat's home stand?

Robinson's next chance to play will be Sunday against the Cleveland Cavaliers inside the Kaseya Center but said that he doesn't ""know when for sure that will be"" in terms of his return. If anything, the team is currently in the midst of a four-game home stand, but time is running out on the regular season.

""I wouldn't count out anything,"" Robinson said via The Miami Herald. ""I want to play as soon as I possibly can, I don't know when for sure that will be.""

The Heat are 38-32 on the season which puts them seventh in the tightly packed Eastern Conference with 13 games left in the regular season. In the home stand as mentioned before, they will face the Cavs Sunday, the Golden State Warriors Tuesday, and then the Portland Trail Blazers Friday.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Zachary Weinberger,-0.2156862745098039,448917111,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/heat-news-duncan-robinson-gives-critical-back-injury-update-its-improving-a-lot.jpeg,eng-9420783

Months of attacks in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi terrorists following the Israel-Hamas war have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa, and stoked fears that the war could spread to destabilize the wider Middle East.

Many people are turning to cannabis, a non-psychoactive substance, for its possible therapeutic benefits as the stigma associated with it fades. This blog seeks to clarify the complexities of CBD Oil Canada by highlighting its advantages, applications, and the state of the law pertaining to this alternative medicine.

Benefits of CBD Oil

Pain Management: CBD oil has shown promise in managing chronic pain by interacting with the endocannabinoid system, which regulates pain perception. It's particularly beneficial for conditions like arthritis and neuropathic pain. Anxiety and Stress Reduction: Studies suggest that CBD may help alleviate anxiety and stress by affecting the serotonin receptors in the brain. Many users report a calming effect, making it a potential natural remedy for anxiety-related disorders. Sleep Improvement: CBD oil may aid in improving sleep quality by addressing factors like insomnia and sleep disturbances. Its calming properties can promote relaxation, contributing to a better night's sleep. Anti-inflammatory Properties: CBD has anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential remedy for inflammatory conditions like arthritis. By reducing inflammation, it may help alleviate symptoms and improve overall joint health. Neuroprotective Effects: Research indicates that CBD may have neuroprotective properties, making it a subject of interest for conditions like epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. It may help protect the brain from damage and promote neurological well-being.

Usage of CBD Oil

Dosage Considerations: Determining the right dosage of CBD oil can be a personal journey. Start with a low dose and gradually increase until you find the optimal amount that provides the desired effects. It's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. Sublingual Administration: The most common method of using CBD oil is sublingual administration, where a few drops are placed under the tongue. This allows for faster absorption into the bloodstream, enhancing the efficiency of the compound. Topical Application: CBD oil is also available in topical forms, such as creams and balms, which can be applied directly to the skin. This method is ideal for targeting localized pain or skin conditions. Incorporating into Food and Beverages: Some users prefer to incorporate CBD oil into their food or beverages. Keep in mind that ingesting CBD orally may result in slower absorption compared to sublingual administration. Capsules and Edibles: Pre-dosed CBD capsules and edibles provide a convenient and discreet way to consume CBD. This method is suitable for those who prefer a measured and controlled dosage.

Legal Landscape of CBD Oil in Canada

The legal status of CBD oil in Canada is closely tied to the broader regulations surrounding cannabis. In 2018, Canada legalized recreational cannabis use, allowing adults to purchase and consume cannabis products. CBD oil derived from hemp, containing less than 0.3% THC, is legal and widely available for purchase without a prescription.

However, CBD oil derived from marijuana plants with higher THC levels is subject to stricter regulations and may require a prescription. Health Canada oversees the regulations surrounding cannabis and CBD products, ensuring compliance with legal standards and quality control.

It's crucial for consumers to be aware of these distinctions and to source their CBD oil from reputable suppliers. Reliable manufacturers provide clear information about the CBD content, sourcing, and third-party testing, ensuring that the product complies with legal standards.

Navigating the CBD Market in Canada

As the demand for CBD oil continues to rise, the market in Canada has expanded significantly. To make informed choices, consider the following factors:

Product Transparency: Choose CBD oil products from manufacturers that provide transparent information about their sourcing, production methods, and third-party testing. This ensures the product's quality and compliance with legal standards. CBD Content and Concentration: Look for products that clearly state the CBD content and concentration per serving. Understanding the potency of the product allows for accurate dosing. Formulation and Ingredients: Consider the formulation and additional ingredients in the CBD oil. Opt for products with natural, high-quality carrier oils and avoid those with unnecessary additives or fillers. Customer Reviews: Explore customer reviews and testimonials for insights into the effectiveness and quality of specific CBD oil products. Authentic feedback can help guide your decision-making process. Consult with Healthcare Professionals: If you have specific health concerns or are considering CBD oil as part of a treatment plan, consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice. They can provide guidance on dosage, potential interactions, and overall suitability.

Conclusion

As you explore the world of CBD oil, remember to prioritize quality, transparency, and compliance with legal standards.

There are several pros and cons for both, and each brand of enthusiast has valid reasons for preferring one over the other.

Gas mileage in particular is often a big talking point when comparing the two options. It's been a long-held general belief that manual transmissions do, in fact, get better gas mileage compared to automatic transmissions in the same model vehicle. Learn to drive a stick and, at least according to this argument, you'll save anywhere from two to five miles per gallon. That could represent savings of $100 to $400 or more in gas per year. Obviously, the overall cost will vary based on a given car's mpg, miles driven per year, and local gas prices, but it certainly seems like a chance to save.

For the first time since its invasion of Ukraine over two years ago, Russia's oil export machine is being meaningfully disrupted by western sanctions. Several recent developments signal increasing friction for Moscow's efforts to keep selling its crucial energy exports despite layers of restrictions imposed by the US, Europe and allies, Bloomberg reports.

The most symbolic blow came as Indian refiners, Russia's second biggest oil customer after China, decided to stop accepting crude cargoes on tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot. The shipping giant had carried about one-fifth of Russia's oil sales to India last year. Now its fleet of over 100 vessels is effectively shut out from that major market as refiners there refuse to take on the sanctions risk.

Dozens of other Russian tankers recently targeted by US sanctions have failed to load any new cargoes since being blacklisted. At least seven Sovcomflot ships appear to have gone entirely dark, disappearing from tracking systems in the Black Sea. The company itself admitted this week that western penalties have severely disrupted operations.

Meanwhile, Russian diesel cargoes are piling up at sea unable to find buyers. Over 6 million barrels were floating idle as of mid-March, the highest volume since at least 2017, according to data analytics firm Kpler. The apparent diesel glut comes despite Ukraine's efforts to crimp supplies through drone attacks on Russian refineries.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group. ""It comes at a time when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline.""

While Russia can still lean on a ""shadow fleet"" of re-flagged tankers to bypass restrictions, the shipping costs have skyrocketed. Delivering Russian crude to China now incurs around $14.50 per barrel in freight fees, over half of which is directly attributable to sanctions, according to estimates from Argus Media.

The growing supply-chain barriers mark a shift for the Kremlin. For most of the last two years, Russia managed to reroute huge volumes of oil to cooperative nations like India, allowing it to sustain a major revenue stream financing the invasion against Ukraine despite western restrictions. But that picture is changing, gradually tightening the economic vise on Vladimir Putin as the war grinds on.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Janis Kluge, a sanctions expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. While the impact remains limited for now, ""it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

As the layers of penalties thicken, all eyes are on how far the US and allies will go ahead of a heated 2024 election cycle when high energy costs could enrage American voters.

Since its full-scale invasion in 2022, Moscow has been able to maintain a robust trade, even increasing its oil revenues. This resilience is attributed to the country's ability to reroute its oil exports to friendly nations like India and China, bypassing the sanctions. As a result, Russia has continued to earn significant revenue from its fossil fuel exports, which has supported its economy and war efforts against Ukraine.

Recently, Ukrainian drone strikes have targeted Russian oil refineries, reducing the country's refining capacity and forcing a temporary ban on gasoline exports to stabilize domestic prices.

These developments suggest that while Russia has been able to circumvent some of the sanctions, the combined effects of targeted attacks on its oil infrastructure and stricter enforcement of sanctions are beginning to disrupt its oil export machine. This could have significant implications for the Kremlin's ability to sustain its invasion of Ukraine.",euromaidanpress.com,news,Euromaidan Press,Orysia Hrudka,-0.08235294117647063,448914806,1,https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/159929-1_large.jpg,ukr-235913

Environmental activists from Just Stop Oil are calling on the United Nations to back their ""human right to protest"".

The group's 22-year-old ""poster girl"", Phoebe Plummer, faces the first trial under the new UK Section 7 law in May. Rules mean convicted protesters can be jailed for up to a year, fined or both for interfering with ""the use or operation of key national infrastructure"".

But Just Stop Oil claims the legislation is in breach of UN convention and Plummer has urged fellow activists to sign a complaint to Michel Forst, a human rights advisor to the body. She said: ""Charged under sec 7 of the public order act? People who have been are putting in a complaint to the UN!

""Sec 7 is a new law disproportionately restricting our human right to protest, and there is a strong case that this places the UK in breach of UN conventions. This has to be done very quickly as myself and 2 others will be starting the first sec 7 trial in less than 2 months! Adding your name could be a huge help in your defence when you go to trial.""

Phoebe Plummer faces the first trial under the new UK Section 7 law in May

Police have been using the new law since last year. It is part of a wider European crackdown on climate protests, in which France and Germany have taken an anti-terror approach to some demos. On October 30, some 65 Just Stop Oil activists were held after slow-marching in Parliament Square against new oil and gas projects.

Activists will cite the UN's Aarhus Convention, which we signed up to in 2001 and grants rights in relation to the environment, including ""public participation and access to justice"". But its legal force here is unclear as it is not incorporated in UK law.

Mr Forst, UN Special Rapporteur for Environmental Defenders, has expressed concern over ""regressive"" new laws. He said in January: ""Prior to these developments, it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK."" The Home Office said: ""The right to protest is a fundamental part of democracy but must be balanced with protecting the law-abiding majority's right to go about their lives, free from disruption.""",mirror.co.uk,news,Mirror,Patrick Hill,-0.1294117647058823,448914482,1,https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32426421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_1Mirror-exclusive-leftA.jpg,

He said those cases of burns occurred due to improper use of domestic liquified petroleum gas (LPG).

He said even though domestic LPG cylinders were not supposed to be kept indoors, it had been proved that members of the public usually kept them indoors.

He said what was even worse was when people put stones on the regulator instead of servicing them properly in case of leakages.

Dr Ampomah said this as a call to action for domestic fire safety and paediatric burn prevention campaign initiated by the Public Health Alliance International Ghana (PHAIG).

The campaign, among others, is aimed at reducing the incidence of paediatric burns, promoting awareness of child safety and paediatric burn management, as well as raising funds to support paediatric burns patients in the country.

Dr Ampomah also urged the public to be careful with their electrical gadgets, especially now that the country was experiencing frequent power outages, explaining that sometimes, those frequent power surges could cause domestic fires and put people's lives in danger.

Describing injury from burns as one of the most significant traumatic but largely preventable incidents an individual could experience. He said 80 per cent of the incidents were due to some form of carelessness on the part of the victims or caregivers in the case of children, and, therefore, stressed the need for the country to put in place both primary and secondary preventive strategies.

Those strategies, which he said had helped other high-income countries, were personal education, enforcing building regulations, including design, and ensuring that public buildings had compartmentation so that in the event of fire, it would not be able to spread to other rooms, among other strategies.

He also talked about the need for people to change or check the wiring in their homes.

He said burns accounted for about 300,000 deaths around the world every year, pointing out that whereas in the developed world mortality from burns was about 0.8 per 100,000 population, that of other parts of the world was 10.3 per 100,000 population.

He said aside from the fact that people could lose their lives from burns, for those who survived, it could cause disfiguring, especially in the face, which led to stigmatisation.

Furthermore, he said burns could cause loss of vision and difficulty in breathing when it occurred around the nose, and the scars were prone to forming cancers 10 or more years after the injury.

For females who suffer injuries on their chests, Dr Ampomah explained that at puberty, because their scarred skin could not contain their growth, they would have to undergo surgery to enable their breasts to develop.

In Ghana, Dr Ampomah said a look at epidemiology showed that over 50 per cent of burns occurred in children, with the commonest cause being hot liquids either in the kitchen or bathroom.

He, therefore, called for the kitchen to be out of bounds for children, adding that it should not be a play area for them.

He mentioned things that predisposed children to burns to include placing hot liquids on a table that had table cloth and placing liquid chemicals such as acid in open places where children could easily access them.

The Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Life Sciences Limited, Dhananjay Tripathi, said one of the glaring challenges faced by burns patients was the difficulty in obtaining the best and most appropriate treatment, adding that in many cases, the expertise and resources required for optimal care might be scarce, leading to suboptimal outcomes and prolonged suffering.

They accumulate carbon faster than any other natural forest ecosystem in the world.

But climate change is making it harder for these forests to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in wood. During heat waves, they stop removing carbon altogether and release it instead.

What will happen as heat waves occur more frequently? Tasmania's tall eucalypt forests will become carbon sources more and more of the time. As temperatures continue to rise, the forests will reach a ""tipping point"". When this happens the forests will no longer be able to store carbon and mass tree deaths will occur.

My new report released today makes recommendations about preparing for this. There are serious implications for greenhouse gas emissions, conservation and wood production. We cannot ignore the risks of a warming climate. There is a lot we can do now to prepare and make future forests more resilient.

The Tasmania Wilderness World Heritage Area is ranked number one of all UNESCO sites globally for taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it. That's because western Tasmania's high rainfall and cool temperatures are ideal for forest growth.

These tall eucalypt forests contribute greatly to Tasmania's claim to net-zero emissions in its greenhouse gas accounts.

The forests have produced most of the high-quality sawlogs supplying Tasmania's sawmilling industry for more than a century.

They also provide unique and long-lasting habitat for wildlife. Large logs support diverse communities of insects and fungi.

The forest supports unique tourism experiences and an emerging opportunity for ""big tree tourism"".

Tall eucalypt forests are dominated by one or two or three species of Eucalyptus:

As temperatures continue to rise, many ecosystems are predicted to reach a tipping point. This is the point at which the ecosystem can no longer function and is eventually replaced by a different ecosystem.

Many plant-based ecosystems, mostly in the tropics, are expected to reach a tipping point within three decades. Tasmania's tall eucalypt forests may be among them because they share similarities with tropical rainforest.

World Heritage values would be jeopardized, huge amounts of stored carbon would be released, and biodiversity dependent on the tall trees would be threatened. So there is an urgent need to begin preparing now for a future tipping point in these forests.

The main ambition of the measures outlined in my report released today is to restore forested areas after the original forest is lost -- or damaged irreversibly. The new forests would be grown from the same species of eucalypts but the seed sown would regenerate forests better suited to the new climate than the original forest.

To achieve this ambition, we need to decide what features of tall eucalypt forests we want to retain in future forests. Capacity for rapid growth after disturbance would be high on the list of those features.

We also need to know what features need to change to make the forests better suited to a new climate. Increasing the optimum temperature for carbon uptake is the top priority.

In new research, soon to be published, I reviewed several studies that compared the features of Tasmanian tall eucalypt forests with other forests on the Australian mainland.

I wanted to understand why Tasmania's forests were so sensitive to heat waves and what, if anything, could be done to lessen their impact. I found the poor response to heat waves had more to do with the local conditions than anything else. The forests are accustomed to high rainfall and a narrow temperature range.

Could we speed up natural selection to help Tasmania's tall eucalypt forests adapt to a new, warmer climate?

Previous research has shown forests can be managed to speed up natural selection and produce seed better suited to new climates. But this is only feasible in forests managed for wood production.

We need to find out whether natural selection can increase the optimum temperature for carbon uptake by the forest, and if so, by how much.

We need to ensure the right policy settings are in place. A policy to end logging of native forests, for example, would rule out speeding up natural selection.

And we need to think and plan what to do if tall eucalypt forests in reserves are lost or irreparably damaged. Should we try to restore new generations of tall eucalypt forests, and if so, how?

Finally, community support is required. People need to understand what we are trying to achieve. They can also bring new ideas about how to make tall eucalypt forests more resilient.

Timely, accurate, trusted, and accessible information will be crucial. Ongoing monitoring of the tall eucalypt forest in the upper reaches of Tasmania's Huon Valley can provide much of this information.

Clearly, humanity must cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. But some climate impacts are now unavoidable and we need to be prepared.

As heat waves intensify, Tasmania's tall eucalypt forests will reach a tipping point. Trees will die. The forest we know today will be lost forever.

But if we are prepared, we can ensure another forest takes its place. With our help, future generations of tall eucalypt forests can still exist -- forests better suited to Tasmania's new climate.",phys.org,news,Phys.org,,-0.0117647058823529,448912049,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/eucalypt.jpg,eng-9412639

It was a frustrating Friday night for the Miami Heat as they fell to the New Orleans Pelicans inside the Kaseya Center, 111-88, as time is running out to solidify playoff position. Heat star Bam Adebayo spoke after the game to the media and touched on what led up to to the defeat in the first contest of the team's current four-game home stand.

The last time these two teams faced against each other on Feb. 23, there was a heated altercation that resulted in multiple players being suspended like star Jimmy Butler, but Miami was fully healthy. Fast forward to the present time and integral pieces like Tyler Herro, Kevin Love, and Duncan Robinson are out for the foreseeable future as Adebayo said to ClutchPoints that it doesn't matter ""who's in or out,"" they need to ""hone in on the little things.""

""I feel like we go out there and play with the right energy, doesn't matter who's in or out, we've shown all season we can win with whatever lineup,"" Adebayo said. ""We just need to hone in on the little things, the detail-oriented things.""

Adebayo says Heat missing Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kevin Love

Despite the Heat being under-manned for a lot of this season as the team continues to be plagued with injuries, there's no doubt that they miss the likes of Herro, Love, and Robinson. Even Adebayo said Miami misses them ""a lot"" due to the three players providing so much to the team.

""A lot,"" Adebayo answered with how much the Heat miss their injured players. ""Just because they play heavy minutes for us, you can't replace a guy like Duncan [Robinson]who shoots it from anywhere, a guy like Tyler [Herro] who can create his own shot, and obviously the leadership of K-Love [Kevin Love].""

While the three aforementioned players bring a lot to Miami, the one common aspect they excel at is shooting the ball from three-point range, which is something the team struggled at Friday against the Pelicans. Besides shooting 36 percent from the field, they shot a measly 27.7 percent from deep, missing 34 attempts which is the most this season and the fifth most in the franchise's history.

Herro, who the Heat star is still dealing with right foot medial tendinitis as he recently got an ejection as a part of treatment, missed his 14th straight game Friday. The last game he played funny enough was against the Pelicans on Feb. 23 as he is averaging 20.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game while shooting 43.7 percent from the field.

As for Love, he's missed the last 12 games with a right heel bruise where his last action was on Feb. 27 in the win against the Portland Trail Blazers. Besides shooting from three, he was crucial as being the true backup center for Adebayo as he provides spacing, veteran leadership, and more.

Adebayo talking about the poor offense plaguing the defense

Far too often, the Heat have seen their poor offense dictate how the defense performs which is what happened against the Pelicans. Adebayo said that reasoning wasn't 100 percent the case this time around as he mentioned how when Miami got out of flow, New Orleans adapted and got hot late.

""I feel like we just got out of flow,"" Adebayo said. ""I don't really feel like it effected the defense, but obviously when teams are getting stopped, they get a different type of flow, type of energy, they start making tough shots, guys start playing harder.""

However, it was a mixed bag on the defensive side as the Heat kept star Zion Williamson scoreless through the first half which is the first time that has happened in his NBA career. He would finish with four points, but Miami let others on the Pelicans feast including CJ McCollum who had 30 and was slippery throughout the whole game.

Pelicans kept Adebayo at bay Friday night

As for Adebayo on the offensive side, he would finish with 12 points and 10 rebounds as he made four of his seven attempts from the field. Not a bad shooting percentage, but the Pelicans clogged the paint to prevent Adebayo getting any shots up as he said after the game that for him to get activated, himself and the team has to excel in other areas.

""I feel like for us we just have to do the little things,"" Adebayo said. ""Details on screens, getting guys open, making an extra effort to cut. Also, we have to share the ball and find ways to get each other open shots.""

The Heat are now 38-32 on the season which puts them seventh in the tightly packed Eastern Conference. With 13 games left in the regular season, there is vastly no room for error as their next outing is the second in the current home stand as they will face the Cleveland Cavaliers Sunday.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Zachary Weinberger,0.01960784313725483,448911410,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bam-Adebayo-gets-painfully-honest-on-ugly-Pelicans-loss.jpeg,

Just as the wheel forever changed human civilization, so too did the invention of the hot-dog roller. Finally, there's a method to evenly cook these tubular treats, keeping them perpetually warm while not incinerating them, and simultaneously displaying them in a tantalizing way (translation: not floating in greasy water) that was easily tong-able for hungry travelers on the go.

It was the biggest thing to happen to frankfurters since the advent of the bun.

The spinning grills have made cameos at carnivals and stadium concession stands, but their natural habitat is and always will be the gas station. And while convenience-store commissaries have evolved into mini-restaurants serving everything from pizza to fried chicken to subs to mac-n-cheese and lending roller space to all sorts of tube-shaped foods like taquitos, egg rolls, corndogs, and cheese-filled buffalo chicken ... things, the hot dog is still the quintessential road food -- quick, hot, cheap, handheld, and relatively no-mess (unless you're in Chicago).

Still, when rating gas-station hot dogs, there's a wide range of variables from chain to chain and from store to store. There are different types of hot dog (all beef to cheese-stuffed mystery meat medley), selection of toppings (basic ketchup and mustard to taco sauce) and bun-storage methods (plastic-wrapped to steamed). There are also the pitfalls of when during the day the dogs are put out on the rollers, and more importantly, how long they're left there.

Nevertheless, I hit the road midday to size up four hopefully fresh local gas-station dogs to see who was best in show.

I know from experience that 7-Eleven can deliver on grub, especially when it comes to its 100% all-beef dog. Unfortunately, this time, at this location, the plastic-wrapped buns in the drawer were stale. These icon c-stores typically offer all sorts of toppings from onions to relish to jalapeño peppers. And while the sausage itself was beefy and just the right temp between hot and warm, it was going to take a lot to soften our hearts after getting stiffed by the bread.

3. Huck's Bigg Dog

Even with more than 120 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, Huck's Markets still fly a bit under the radar when it comes to gas-station food. (They are one of the last bastions of Godfather's Pizza, after all.) Huck's Markets are actually a reliable source of relatively healthy road food with salads and wraps -- but one does not count calories when on a serious hot dog hunt. Our Huck's side quest started off bumpy, with a stiff but not quite stale bun pulled from a dry and lukewarm steamer drawer and no box, boat, or wrapper to place it in. But the dog itself was plump and juicy -- if only I had a way to carry it to the car.

2. On the Run Jumbo Hot Dog

Even though this was our first stop, I was worried about this slightly dark, slightly wrinkled dog. How long had he been waiting here? But in the name of journalism, I soldiered forward -- and I'm glad I did. The dog was juicy and not the least bit tough or chewy. In fact, it was probably the beefiest treat I had that day. The bun, which was individually wrapped was cold, though not stale. A solid road-food staple.

1. QuikTrip Hot Dog

This dog was an entire league above all the rest. First of all, QuikTrip (or QT) knows what it's doing when it comes to food. It's commissary is one of the best anywhere outside of a Buc-ees brisket-carving station. And QT usually dedicates an entire aisle (or two) to its roller grills. So we weren't shocked when we opened the steam drawer and found actual steaming water keeping the buns soft and warm. Then the dog: a 100% all-beef Oscar Meyer wiener. You want toppings? How about your choice of relish Buffalo sauce, sriracha ranch, chipotle, honey mustard, smoky bbq, or gourmet ranch? They even had bacon bits and celery salt. But even with just ketchup and mustard, this was a warm, soft, salty delight. The dog alone is worth making QT a destination rather than just a pit stop on the way.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2156862745098038,448911328,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F9NOG92OoSAzCPWOnByb.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/all_recipes_969/2b1cc682b96823dfe9bcfbbdf0094c06,

Starting July 1, it will be illegal for local governments to pass health and safety measures for outdoor workers in extreme heat. The decision comes after Florida experienced its hottest summer on record.

""In just a few months, as Florida temperatures soar to triple digits, outdoor workers will face increasingly dangerous conditions,"" said Esteban Wood, the policy director at WeCount!, a nonprofit that helps immigrant workers in South Florida. ""Workers will suffer heat stroke, businesses will lose out on billions in lost worker productivity, and local emergency rooms will become overwhelmed with heat related hospitalizations.""

Miami-Dade County's outdoor worker activists with WeCount! had been organizing for the nation's first county-wide heat standard since 2017. The coalition of workers officially launched their Que Calor! Campaign in 2021 and came close to getting the Board of County Commissioners to approve the proposed heat standard in September, but by November, commissioners buckled under lobbyist pressure, and the final vote was postponed until March 2024 in the hopes of gaining support.

Less than a week later, state Rep. Tiffany Esposito filed House Bill 433, which was designed to prevent cities and counties across Florida from enacting workplace heat standards. The bill was passed on March 8, just weeks before the county was set to determine the local decision.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average annual heat-related deaths have risen 95% from 2010 to 2022. The ¡Que Calor! Heat Standard originally included a heat exposure safety program for workers and their supervisors about the risks of heat exposure and best practices for minimizing heat-related illness. The standard also stated that on days with a heat index of at least 90 degrees Fahrenheit, workers have a right to 10 minutes of paid rest and a water break every two hours to cool down under shade and avoid heat stroke. The standard has now been raised to 95 degrees.

The proposed Miami-Dade Heat Standard would have guaranteed access to water and shaded rest breaks for more than 100,000 outdoor workers in Miami-Dade County.

""Now, with HB 433 in place, local officials will be powerless to meaningfully respond to their communities in crisis,"" Wood said. ""Cities and counties will be barred from requiring water breaks for workers and banned from enacting safety rules that provide workers relief.""

Commissioners at the November meeting questioned who would be responsible for paying the fines if the heat standard is not followed since a construction company might hire contractors who hire subcontractors who then hire individual workers for the job. Commissioners said a study would need to be done to gauge the financial impact the standard would have on industries. The newly passed legislation will affect roughly 2 million outdoor workers across the state and render existing local protections ""void and prohibited"" beginning July 1.

""Make no mistake: when given the choice, Republican lawmakers chose to protect corporate profits over everyday people,"" Wood said.",truthout.org,news,Truthout,,-0.02745098039215688,448911215,1,https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1766414151-1536x1025.jpg,eng-9416253

The analysis, published this week by the climate think tank Carbon Tracker, found that none of the 25 biggest oil and gas companies are currently considered to be ""Paris compliant,"" that is; in alignment with the 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit set under the Paris climate accord.

In fact, the report found that fossil fuel behemoths ConocoPhillips, Saudi Aramco, Pioneer, and ExxonMobil were ranked as the furthest from meeting those goals.

The report graded companies using a five-metric rubric; measuring current and future operations, investment options, production plans, newly approved projects, and emissions reduction targets.

They were then assigned scores ranging from 'A' through 'H,' with 'A' representing the closest to full alignment Paris warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 'H' representing the furthest from alignment with this target, with activities and investments that yield a temperature increase of at least 2.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

The best-scoring company was BP, which received a letter grade of D-, the report found, while ConocoPhillips received the lowest-ranking score of an H.

Three of the five lowest-scoring companies -- Exxon Mobil, Pioneer, and ConocoPhillips -- are also U.S.-based.

The report comes as oil and gas firms have pledged to clean up their industry and reduce emissions and practices such as venting and flaring, which is known to emit large amounts of methane and other harmful greenhouse gases.

But they have also scaled up plans for production in recent months, citing an uptick in projected global demand as the world looks to build out dependable, dispatchable emissions-free sources of power.

Featured Local Savings

Speaking at an oil and gas industry conference in Houston earlier this week, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said companies should shift their focus toward cleaner technologies rather than the transition to renewable energy resources.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,"" Nasser said at CERAWeek, hosted by S&P Global.

The report highlights the disparity between the company's pledges and investments on climate change and their actions in this space, said Carbon Tracker analyst Maeve O'Connor, who co-authored the report.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" O'Connor said.

""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies,"" she added.

Chances are you've done it before. I used to do it, I stopped just cause I was too lazy though, not because I realized it could be hurting my truck.

Come to think of it, I remember when I was a kid, my stepdad used to use his body to rock his truck to trick the gas pump into squeezing more gasoline into his tank. What the heck was that about it?

Topping off was something I did when I was younger, probably some carryover from my stepdad's habit, but I eventually stopped. But honestly, I just got tired of playing that game of click, squirt, click, squirt. I didn't know it was bad.

If you haven't figured it out yet, it's overfilling your gas tank. Doing it can hurt your vehicle. And, yeah, sure there's a little room left in your tank after that click, but that's by design. The gas pump automatically stops when sensors indicate the car's tank is full. At that point, you should put the nozzle away.

After the team parted ways with a number of notable players such as Max Struss and Gabe Vincent, many questioned how the decision would impact them this year. With the postseason in sight, the team is sitting in seventh place in the East, and is likely to remain in play-in contention.

With the sixth-place Pacers sitting 1.5 games ahead of them in the standings, the Heat would have to go on a big win streak in the next few weeks to stave off a play-in appearance. Despite that, as we've seen in the past, regardless of what seed Miami is, they can always be considered championship contenders.

This, of course, is largely due to Heat Culture, something that has been a major talking point in past years. The way rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. sees things, Heat culture is built for the playoffs, and is a major reason why the team finds success year after year in the postseason.

He spoke on a recent episode of JJ Redick's Old Man & The Three podcast to discuss the situation:

""Really, everything is just of the playoffs and to prepare for that. And that kind of been the theme throughout this entire season. When coaches come and talk to me, they are like everything we are doing now for you is to prepare for you when you get to the playoffs, because that is the most important thing, just winning.

Looking at Jaime Jaquez Jr. and the Miami Heat's route to the postseason

As previously mentioned, Jaime Jaquez Jr. and the Miami Heat currently sit on the brink of play-in contention. With the team currently sitting in seventh place, should the team finish the season in the same spot, they would compete against the Philadelphia 76ers in the play-in tournament.

Of course, the Heat and the 76ers are currently tied with 38-32 records, meaning that things can change between now and then. What's unlikely to happen, however, is that either of the two teams falls int the ninth or tenth place spot.

With the Bulls four games behind, and the Hawks 4.5 games behind, the Heat and 76ers are likely to battle it out for the seven and eight seeds. Of course, when it comes to the play-in tournament, the seventh and eighth place teams will compete with the winner advancing to the postseason as the seventh seed.

The team who loses will then play the winner of the game between the ninth and tenth place teams for a chance to clinch a playoff berth. With the stakes at an all-time high heading into the final stretch of the season, the Heat, and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will both need to be at their best.",sportskeeda.com,news,Sportskeeda,Evan Bell,0.2705882352941176,448910204,1,https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/03/ade34-17112125961919-1920.jpg,

Also handed over to the NSCDC were two tugboats, two badges and nine storage facilities with an unspecified quantity of crude oil used in perpetrating their illegal activities.

Commander of NNS Delta, Commodore Abba Muhsin, disclosed that the suspects were apprehended on March 8, at WATSON Jetty, Edjeba, in Warri South Local Government area of Delta State.

Commodore Muhsin, who was represented during the handing over of the suspects and other facilities by Base Operations Officer, Commander Patrick Onoja Ali, said the oil thieves were nabbed following an intelligence report about the activities.

""In March 8, this year, NNS Delta got intelligence on some suspected illegal oil bunkering operations happening at WATSON Jetty, Edjeba, in Warri. So our men were deployed to this location. We conducted raids from different locations and at the end, 10 suspects, two tug boats, two badges and nine storage facilities were apprehended,"" he said.

Muhsin warned perpetrators of illegal oil bunkering to steer clear of NNS Delta's area of operations vowing they would be tracked down and made to face the full wrath of the law.

""Our targets are those who hide under illegal means to perpetrate oil-related illegalities and those who outrightly perpetrate such illegalities. If you do not change, we will unbundle and flush you out of Delta.

""This is one of the series of actions, in support of Operations Delta Sanity of the Nigerian Navy and Operations Delta Safe of Defence Headquarters as part of the Navy's Coast Guard functions towards nation building,"" he said.

He assured that his command will remain resolute to free its areas of operations from all forms of illegal oil theft and other activities and commended all government agencies that support its operations.

Receiving the suspects, Commander, Warri Anti-Vandal Patrol of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Abdullahi Murtala, said the Corps will carry out further investigations and possible prosecution of the suspects.

This convenience store just became a destination and not just a pit stop along the way.

Just as the wheel forever changed human civilization, so too did the invention of the hot-dog roller. Finally, there's a method to evenly cook these tubular treats, keeping them perpetually warm while not incinerating them, and simultaneously displaying them in a tantalizing way (translation: not floating in greasy water) that was easily tong-able for hungry travelers on the go.

It was the biggest thing to happen to frankfurters since the advent of the bun.

The spinning grills have made cameos at carnivals and stadium concession stands, but their natural habitat is and always will be the gas station. And while convenience-store commissaries have evolved into mini-restaurants serving everything from pizza to fried chicken to subs to mac-n-cheese and lending roller space to all sorts of tube-shaped foods like taquitos, egg rolls, corndogs, and cheese-filled buffalo chicken ... things, the hot dog is still the quintessential road food -- quick, hot, cheap, handheld, and relatively no-mess (unless you're in Chicago).

Still, when rating gas-station hot dogs, there's a wide range of variables from chain to chain and from store to store. There are different types of hot dog (all beef to cheese-stuffed mystery meat medley), selection of toppings (basic ketchup and mustard to taco sauce) and bun-storage methods (plastic-wrapped to steamed). There are also the pitfalls of when during the day the dogs are put out on the rollers, and more importantly, how long they're left there.

Nevertheless, I hit the road midday to size up four hopefully fresh local gas-station dogs to see who was best in show.

The Best Gas Station Hot Dogs, Ranked

4. 7-Eleven Big Bite

I know from experience that 7-Eleven can deliver on grub, especially when it comes to its 100% all-beef dog. Unfortunately, this time, at this location, the plastic-wrapped buns in the drawer were stale. These icon c-stores typically offer all sorts of toppings from onions to relish to jalapeño peppers. And while the sausage itself was beefy and just the right temp between hot and warm, it was going to take a lot to soften our hearts after getting stiffed by the bread.

3. Huck's Bigg Dog

Even with more than 120 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, Huck's Markets still fly a bit under the radar when it comes to gas-station food. (They are one of the last bastions of Godfather's Pizza, after all.) Huck's Markets are actually a reliable source of relatively healthy road food with salads and wraps -- but one does not count calories when on a serious hot dog hunt. Our Huck's side quest started off bumpy, with a stiff but not quite stale bun pulled from a dry and lukewarm steamer drawer and no box, boat, or wrapper to place it in. But the dog itself was plump and juicy -- if only I had a way to carry it to the car.

2. On the Run Jumbo Hot Dog

Even though this was our first stop, I was worried about this slightly dark, slightly wrinkled dog. How long had he been waiting here? But in the name of journalism, I soldiered forward -- and I'm glad I did. The dog was juicy and not the least bit tough or chewy. In fact, it was probably the beefiest treat I had that day. The bun, which was individually wrapped was cold, though not stale. A solid road-food staple.

1. QuikTrip Hot Dog

This dog was an entire league above all the rest. First of all, QuikTrip (or QT) knows what it's doing when it comes to food. It's commissary is one of the best anywhere outside of a Buc-ees brisket-carving station. And QT usually dedicates an entire aisle (or two) to its roller grills. So we weren't shocked when we opened the steam drawer and found actual steaming water keeping the buns soft and warm. Then the dog: a 100% all-beef Oscar Meyer wiener. You want toppings? How about your choice of relish Buffalo sauce, sriracha ranch, chipotle, honey mustard, smoky bbq, or gourmet ranch? They even had bacon bits and celery salt. But even with just ketchup and mustard, this was a warm, soft, salty delight. The dog alone is worth making QT a destination rather than just a pit stop on the way.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said this on the air of the national telethon, Ukrinform reports.

""We need to understand whether this was a deliberate strike targeting the dam, or whether they simply missed the HPP. If this was a deliberate strike and they are aiming to collapse the dam itself, these attacks will repeat and they will be targeting the dam again. Therefore, as repair work will be done, it is also important to understand the scale of these attacks, if they are planning them specifically to destroy the dam,"" Galushchenko said.

Currently, according to the minister, the situation remains difficult. Equipment is undergoing damage assessment and only after that will it be possible to determine repair deadlines before the HPP can be put back into operation.

The analysis, published this week by the climate think tank Carbon Tracker, found that none of the 25 biggest oil and gas companies are currently considered to be ""Paris compliant,"" that is; in alignment with the 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit set under the Paris climate accord.

In fact, the report found that fossil fuel behemoths ConocoPhillips, Saudi Aramco, Pioneer, and ExxonMobil were ranked as the furthest from meeting those goals.

The report graded companies using a five-metric rubric; measuring current and future operations, investment options, production plans, newly approved projects, and emissions reduction targets.

They were then assigned scores ranging from 'A' through 'H,' with 'A' representing the closest to full alignment Paris warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 'H' representing the furthest from alignment with this target, with activities and investments that yield a temperature increase of at least 2.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

The best-scoring company was BP, which received a letter grade of D-, the report found, while ConocoPhillips received the lowest-ranking score of an H.

Three of the five lowest-scoring companies -- Exxon Mobil, Pioneer, and ConocoPhillips -- are also U.S.-based.

The report comes as oil and gas firms have pledged to clean up their industry and reduce emissions and practices such as venting and flaring, which is known to emit large amounts of methane and other harmful greenhouse gases.

But they have also scaled up plans for production in recent months, citing an uptick in projected global demand as the world looks to build out dependable, dispatchable emissions-free sources of power.

Speaking at an oil and gas industry conference in Houston earlier this week, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said companies should shift their focus toward cleaner technologies rather than the transition to renewable energy resources.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,"" Nasser said at CERAWeek, hosted by S&P Global.

El Nino is known for cranking up the heat and has lingered since the latter half of 2023. With changes in sea surface temperatures and winds over the tropical Pacific Ocean, El Nino brings hot and dry conditions across Southeast Asia, including Singapore.

The MSS issued its annual climate assessment report, sounding the alarm for what could be a toasty year ahead.

2024 could be an even warmer year for Singapore

As The Straits Times reported, MSS said, ""Since the warmest annual temperatures from any El Nino events typically occur the year after an El Nino forms both for Singapore and globally, 2024 could be an even warmer year.""

Last year, besides El Nino, positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions also paid a visit, adding to the warmth with variations in atmospheric and sea surface temperatures across the Indian Ocean. Sandwiched between two vast ocean basins, Singapore is no stranger to the ripple effects of changes in both.

MSS said, ""Both El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole events are typically associated with warmer temperatures in Singapore, while La Nina tends to moderate Singapore's temperatures.""

In 2023, Singapore experienced both phases of this natural climate cycle, which helped moderate temperatures, especially in the early months of the year.

However, despite La Nina's cooling touch, Singapore still felt the heat. Monthly temperatures from April onwards soared above the usual averages.

An MSS spokeswoman suggested that La Nina conditions may have tempered Singapore's temperatures, explaining why the island's temperature records diverged from reports of 2023 being the world's warmest year.

She further noted the anticipated divergence of individual regions or countries from the global average ranking.

Regarding 2023, she highlighted that the warmest temperature anomalies were predominantly observed in northern regions, including Western Europe, Northern Canada, and Central Asia.

While Singapore's temperature records might not perfectly match global trends, MSS assures that the island's warming patterns match those worldwide.

The World Meteorological Organisation's 2023 State of the Climate report confirms that temperatures have steadily climbed, with the past nine years ranking as the warmest globally.

Human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels, pump heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, nudging temperatures upwards.

MSS warned that as temperatures keep rising, the numbers from this decade will seem cooler compared to what's expected in the middle of the century (2040 to 2059), according to Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study.

But it's not just about discomfort. High temperatures bring health risks, especially for vulnerable groups.

In 2023, Singapore experienced 37 days of high heat stress, which could triple by 2050 if temperatures keep rising unchecked, according to MSS.

These scorching days, with Wet Bulb Globe Temperatures hitting 33°C or more, put people at greater risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Singaporeans on Singapore's heat

As Singaporeans feel the heat, some have shared their thoughts and experiences dealing with the scorching temperatures.

One Singaporean, feeling the heat, took to social media to share a warning he received from Google. He posted on r/singapore: ""Despite our familiarity with the heat, I received a heat warning from Google (sourced from an external app) and it kinda served as a wake-up call.""

Another shared, ""Idk how the migrant workers tahan working all day in the heat in full sleeves and full pants.""

Noting the Ramadan season, another stated, ""Some more it's ramadan, so muslim workers are going through the day without water.""

Another chimed in, ""It's tough, man. I just wish time would pass faster for them so that they could hydrate properly again.""

Another shared, ""Was out delivering food jn. saw many of them lying in the shade. poor guys, ramadhan during this time of the year really rabak.""

Meanwhile, one Singaporean, not even outdoors, shared, ""Phone app says it's now 35°C. Room thermometer says it's 33°C.

That could change in the next couple of days.

""While U.S. fuel demand actually slipped a bit this week, supply-side activity has pushed pump prices higher.""

According to the Energy Information Administration, gasoline and crude oil stocks decreased by three million barrels and two million barrels this week, respectively. Regional refineries are operating at 81%, compared with an average of nearly 88% in other parts of the U.S.

The West Texas Intermediate benchmark for crude oil is currently trading near $81 per barrel, the same as a week ago, $3 more than a month ago, and $11 more than a year ago. Elevated crude costs, which topped $83 earlier in the week, are applying upward pressure on gas prices.

Steel production is a traditional heavy industry but it is also a pioneer of the solutions needed for a greener, less environmentally damaged world. Steel is 100% recyclable and much of the industry turns scrap into new products. But the energy required is huge, even if it can be supplied as green electricity, so there's an increasing focus on capturing the heat generated by the steel-making process and recycling or redistributing it. The large heat pump technology involved also offers other industries greener energy solutions, writes Nick Powell.

The ORI Martin steel plant at Brescia in northern Italy is committed to being a good neighbour. Located close to housing, it's very much part of the community and provides much more than employment to the surrounding area. Heat that once escaped through a cooling tower is now sent to a district heating system, keeping 2,000 homes warm in winter. When demand falls away in the summer, the heat is converted into electricity, enough for 700 homes.

At the heart of this 'heat-leap' project, launched in 2020, is a large heat pump, supplied by another Brescia firm, Turboden. It's a pioneering firm that emerged in 1980 from the Politecnico di Milano's research into closed loop energy systems. Now backed by a majority shareholder, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the company is at the cutting edge of large heat pump technology.

Combined with a compressor, it both provides heat at the required temperature to the district heating system and sends colder water back to the steelworks to cool its products once again, completing the circle and saving on water as well as electricity. It's helping ORI Martin's 12-year plan to reduce its emissions by nearly a third by 2030.

Where steel has led, other industries can follow, as they look to cut energy waste for both environmental and economic reasons. Turboden's latest project involves an even larger heat pump, which will enable a Finnish paper mill to stop using gas and so improve its energy security as well as reducing its carbon footprint. Low temperature waste heat from exhaust air and waste water will be superheated to 170 degrees, to produce steam for the paper-making process.

Andrea Magalini, General Manager of Turboden's Heat Generation Business Unit, expects the market for systems using large heat pumps to rapidly expand, with the company working on 10 projects a year in five years' time. Each will call for a specific design to address the individual customer's needs and requirements.

It's marketed as the most competitive technology to produce green heat and promises 99% reliability. One application will be providing the steam required for carbon capture and another exciting prospect is using it in the extraction of lithium, a mineral vital for the batteries needed in electric vehicles.

But Luca Rigoni, Chief Executive of A2A Heat and Services, which runs Brescia's district heating system, heating is the 'elephant in the room' in the decarbonisation debate. How we heat our homes is a major cause of emissions entering the atmosphere and heat pump technology offers the solution. In Brescia alone, the use of heat from the steelworks is preventing the discharge of 917 kilo-tonnes a year of CO2.

Turboden's marketing director, Marco Baresi, says he's glad to see industrial policy becoming more important in the European Union's approach to climate change and implementing its Green Deal. He sees his company's work in developing large heat pump technology as a positive and practical response to the RepowerEU initiative. It's a key strategic technology identified in the Net Zero Industry Act as requiring development in Europe.

It is also an extraordinary opportunity for export to emerging and development countries. Marco Baresi identifies Turboden is a perfect example of a successful European clean technology company, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development.",eureporter.co,news,EU Reporter,,0.1843137254901961,448907624,1,https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0328-1000x600.jpeg,eng-9413677

BMW's global revenue jumped 9% to 155.5 billion euros, with automotive EBIT margin climbing to 9.8%. In addition, BMW said EV sales jumped 74.2% to 375,000 units globally.

BMW's success with EVs, which comes amid weakening demand in the sector, could be a result of its two-pronged EV strategy, Frank Weber, the company's global chief technology officer and board member, told Yahoo Finance at a briefing with reporters on Thursday.

BMW has been releasing vehicles -- for example, the new 7-series -- in both traditional gas-powered and EV form, with both vehicles looking identical. Most other automakers' EVs appear starkly different from their gas-powered brethren, with companies basically offering different product lines.

""When I am visiting our dealerships, I am asking them, 'Is it an advantage or a disadvantage that we are offering the same vehicles with all different [gas-powered and electric] powertrains?'"" he said.

""And for us, it is really key that you find the right solution for the individual person, and I think what has helped ... [is] that we are very clear in our structure [in] that we say a 7-series is a 7-series, a 5-series is a 5-series,"" Weber said.

Weber says this structure helps customers select the car that best suits their needs. He used an example of a European customer who thinks he needs a BEV (battery electric vehicle), but ends up buying a diesel-powered car because it fills his needs better, perhaps because he needs more range or lacks access to charges.

That diversity in its powertrain options is likely helping fuel early BEV success in 2024. In the first two months of the year, BMW reported BEV sales jumped by a ""significant double-digit percentage"" compared to the same period of last year. Growth was disproportionately strong in the US, where the company's BEV sales almost doubled by the end of February compared to last year. Sales growth in Europe and China for BEV models also posted ""significant double-digit growth,"" BMW said.

Weber also touted the company's success with plug-in hybrids, yet another powertrain option available to its customers. Weber said BMW was No. 1 in plug-in hybrid sales in the premium segment, with approximately 1.1 million units sold globally. Separately, the BMW X5 xDrive50e Plug-In Hybrid SUV was named a Consumer Reports top choice in the US.

A vision of BMW's electric SUV future

BMW also unveiled a glimpse of the electric future of its SUVs Thursday, with the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X. The concept, which will closely resemble an actual model that comes out in the second half of next year, is based on BMW's bespoke EV platform dubbed Neue Klasse, which would be a split from its current dual-platform strategy.

Despite this new class of EVs being on a separate platform, technology products like infotainment and electronics will still be shared across EV and gas-powered vehicles, as it keeps costs lower and maintains product consistency. Weber acknowledged this is easier done with brands like BMW where mass-market sales volume isn't a concern.

Despite a cooling off of EV sales in the overall market, Weber is still among those who believe the EV transition is real, though it will take some time to go mainstream.

""When you look back in the last three years, we did not have a natural growth rate of this [EV] technology, and therefore what's going to happen now is not that we will abandon this technology or consumers will say it will not happen, but it is just on a more natural growth path year over year, which is something that is very healthy,"" he said.

As a mature producer, Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing near-field, infrastructure-led exploration to yield new discoveries and bring additional resources into production. Trident Energy launched a three-well infill drilling campaign on Block G at the start of this year utilizing the Island Innovator rig, with all three wells expected to come onstream by mid-year. The rig will then drill the Akeng deep exploration well in Kosmos Energy-operated Block S, targeting potential resources of 180 million barrels of oil. If successful, the campaign could lead to a significant rise in output from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

IAE 2024 (https://apo-opa.co/49krKXM) is an exclusive forum designed to facilitate investment between African energy markets and global investors. Taking place May 14-15, 2024 in Paris, the event offers delegates two days of intensive engagement with industry experts, project developers, investors and policymakers. For more information, please visit www.Invest-Africa-Energy.com. To sponsor or participate as a delegate, please contact [email protected].

Meanwhile, VAALCO Energy is leading development of the Venus Field in Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea, which involves drilling two producer wells and one water injector under a single campaign. The Houston-based firm is planning to bring the project online in 2026, in partnership with national oil company GEPetrol and Atlas Petroleum. Holding interests in six blocks - including producing assets in Block I - Atlas Petroleum is currently seeking farm-in and drilling partners in Blocks EG-02 and H, in which extensive 3D seismic surveys have suggested significant hydrocarbon-bearing potential.

Attracting new players to its exploration scene, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons signed three production sharing contracts last year with Africa Oil Corp. (Block EG-18 and EG-31) and Panoro Energy (EG-01), and expects to sign another for the development of Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 in the coming months. In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil & Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

""Equatorial Guinea is doubling down on gas - a key focal point of the global energy transition and investor interest. The country is single-handedly driving one of the most ambitious LNG initiatives on the continent - the GMH - which holds the potential to establish an intra-African gas trade and catalyze gas-based industries across the region.

Take a deep dive at the opportunities in this brief read.

The oil and gas industry conjures images of drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and high-stakes commerce. It's undeniably a cornerstone of global energy, but what about the lesser-known roles that keep this machine in motion? We're gazing beyond the front lines to explore job opportunities that might surprise you. Read on to learn a few of the different types of jobs in the oil and gas industry.

Exploring Less-Traveled Oil and Gas Careers

We all know about the engineers who design the pipelines and the geologists who find the resources, but there's a rich tapestry of jobs influenced by every aspect of this industry. Consider the unseen heroes, like the health and safety specialists ensuring well-being during the rigors of extraction or the logistics coordinators orchestrating the intricate ballet of resource transportation.

The Myths That Merit a Closer Look

One common misconception about the oil and gas industry is that it lacks opportunity for environmentalists. This stereotype neglects the growing importance of sustainability specialists, renewable energy integration, and eco-friendly practices within companies. Similarly, many underestimate the need for creative thinkers in branding and communications to shape public narratives and stakeholder relations.

Finding Your Fit

With roles spanning from art enthusiasts directing corporate galleries to IT wizards safeguarding cybersecurity, the oil and gas industry offers many opportunities. Among the overlooked are the educators who design and deliver training programs, the legal minds navigating contracts, and the community relations managers fostering positive interactions with local populations.

Developing a Career in the Energy Sector

Fostering a flexible mindset is crucial to carve out your path in the oil and gas industry. Professionals should stay up-to-date with industry trends, engage in networking, and be willing to pivot when needed. This industry rewards adaptability, innovation, and a keen eye for the broader implications of energy and resource management.

Remember, it's not just the engineers and executives who keep this world turning. The multifaceted nature of the oil and gas industry ensures a seat at the table for a wide range of skills. Whether you're a numbers whiz keen on finance or a creative thinker with a passion for impact, there's a job or role for you to play in the oil and gas industry, one of the most influential sectors in the global economy.",milwaukeecourieronline.com,news,Milwaukee Courier Weekly Newspaper,Courier Admin,0.3098039215686275,448906414,26,https://milwaukeecourieronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/silhouetted-oil-worker-pumping-rig.jpg,

Just as the wheel forever changed human civilization, so too did the invention of the hot-dog roller. Finally, there's a method to evenly cook these tubular treats, keeping them perpetually warm while not incinerating them, and simultaneously displaying them in a tantalizing way (translation: not floating in greasy water) that was easily tong-able for hungry travelers on the go.

It was the biggest thing to happen to frankfurters since the advent of the bun.

The spinning grills have made cameos at carnivals and stadium concession stands, but their natural habitat is and always will be the gas station. And while convenience-store commissaries have evolved into mini-restaurants serving everything from pizza to fried chicken to subs to mac-n-cheese and lending roller space to all sorts of tube-shaped foods like taquitos, egg rolls, corndogs, and cheese-filled buffalo chicken ... things, the hot dog is still the quintessential road food -- quick, hot, cheap, handheld, and relatively no-mess (unless you're in Chicago).

Still, when rating gas-station hot dogs, there's a wide range of variables from chain to chain and from store to store. There are different types of hot dog (all beef to cheese-stuffed mystery meat medley), selection of toppings (basic ketchup and mustard to taco sauce) and bun-storage methods (plastic-wrapped to steamed). There are also the pitfalls of when during the day the dogs are put out on the rollers, and more importantly, how long they're left there.

Nevertheless, I hit the road midday to size up four hopefully fresh local gas-station dogs to see who was best in show.

I know from experience that 7-Eleven can deliver on grub, especially when it comes to its 100% all-beef dog. Unfortunately, this time, at this location, the plastic-wrapped buns in the drawer were stale. These icon c-stores typically offer all sorts of toppings from onions to relish to jalapeño peppers. And while the sausage itself was beefy and just the right temp between hot and warm, it was going to take a lot to soften our hearts after getting stiffed by the bread.

3. Huck's Bigg Dog

Even with more than 120 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, Huck's Markets still fly a bit under the radar when it comes to gas-station food. (They are one of the last bastions of Godfather's Pizza, after all.) Huck's Markets are actually a reliable source of relatively healthy road food with salads and wraps -- but one does not count calories when on a serious hot dog hunt. Our Huck's side quest started off bumpy, with a stiff but not quite stale bun pulled from a dry and lukewarm steamer drawer and no box, boat, or wrapper to place it in. But the dog itself was plump and juicy -- if only I had a way to carry it to the car.

2. On the Run Jumbo Hot Dog

Even though this was our first stop, I was worried about this slightly dark, slightly wrinkled dog. How long had he been waiting here? But in the name of journalism, I soldiered forward -- and I'm glad I did. The dog was juicy and not the least bit tough or chewy. In fact, it was probably the beefiest treat I had that day. The bun, which was individually wrapped was cold, though not stale. A solid road-food staple.

1. QuikTrip Hot Dog

This dog was an entire league above all the rest. First of all, QuikTrip (or QT) knows what it's doing when it comes to food. It's commissary is one of the best anywhere outside of a Buc-ees brisket-carving station. And QT usually dedicates an entire aisle (or two) to its roller grills. So we weren't shocked when we opened the steam drawer and found actual steaming water keeping the buns soft and warm. Then the dog: a 100% all-beef Oscar Meyer wiener. You want toppings? How about your choice of relish Buffalo sauce, sriracha ranch, chipotle, honey mustard, smoky bbq, or gourmet ranch? They even had bacon bits and celery salt. But even with just ketchup and mustard, this was a warm, soft, salty delight. The dog alone is worth making QT a destination rather than just a pit stop on the way.",ca.sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports Canada,,0.2156862745098038,448906216,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F9NOG92OoSAzCPWOnByb.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/all_recipes_969/2b1cc682b96823dfe9bcfbbdf0094c06,

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Industry executives assembled here for CERAWeek, one of the world's premier annual energy conferences, disparaged Biden administration regulations on their greenhouse gas emissions and its pause on new gas export permits. But though they're confident Trump would reverse those policies, many fear a return to the volatile international relations and idiosyncratic management style he brought to his previous four years in office.

""Trump is going to be Trump,"" said Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of privately owned oilfield services company Canary and a supporter of the ex-president, crediting his first-term policies for making the United State an energy superpower. ""I expect he'll pick up where he left off if he's reelected.""

""The flip side of that is that he tends to favor a protectionist trade policy and is likely to impose tariffs if he thinks the U.S. is getting a raw deal,"" he added. ""That's going to be a positive selling point for some, but there is always the risk that tariffs could turn into a trade war.""

The oil and gas industry still skews heavily toward the GOP, and Trump has drawn far more money from the industry during the primaries than his GOP competitors. But the sense of ambivalence among the executives this year mirrors the sentiment in the broader electorate, where polls show voters are generally dissatisfied with their choices for the presidency.

Trump has been a staunch backer of the oil and gas industry on the campaign trail, pledging in his stump speeches to ""drill, baby, drill, right away."" But several of his other proposals could pose problems for the companies' bottom lines.

The Trump campaign didn't address specific questions about some industry executives' concerns about his trade record. Instead, it credited the former president with the boom in U.S. energy production -- one that actually started under President George W. Bush, continued under President Barack Obama, and under Biden has helped make the United States the world's energy powerhouse.

""On day one, President Trump will unleash American Energy to lower inflation for all Americans, pay down debt, strengthen national security, and establish the United States as the manufacturing superpower of the world,"" campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said via email.

Trump has taken aim at Biden's Inflation Reduction Act -- a sweeping climate law that aims to move the nation away from fossil fuels but also contains incentives for green technologies that the oil and gas industry sees as potential moneymakers. And he has floated establishing a tariff on all imports to the U.S., which would raise the price on the raw materials the industry needs and could cause a trade-war crossfire for energy companies whose commerce spans the globe.

The heads of the oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and other companies who took the stage at the Houston conference, which ends Friday, did not mention Trump by name or broach the idea of a potentially major change in government policy come next year.

But behind the scenes, interviews with more than a dozen industry executives showed many viewed a possible major realignment of federal energy policy to be part of the new normal -- ""like a change in the weather,"" said one natural gas executive who was granted anonymity to discuss relationships in D.C.

Mike Sommers, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, predicted that Biden's landmark climate law would remain largely intact even if Trump wins in November -- though the industry would work with a GOP administration and congressional Republicans to try to remove provisions crimping the oil industry's bottom line.

""I'm pretty confident that the tax credits that we care about in the IRA are going to continue"" even if Trump regains the White House and Republicans control Congress, Sommers said in an interview. ""I would expect permitting to speed up significantly for onshore and offshore"" oil leasing.

But the uneasiness over Trump's trade policy would complicate business for an industry that has become the world's largest oil producer and natural gas exporter. Trump has floated the idea of slapping a 10 percent ""universal tariff"" on imports into the United States, plus possibly additional tariffs on imports of goods from China -- which would raise the likelihood of retaliatory trade measures.

""If they're actually going to impose a 10 percent import fee that's not something the industry is going to be on board with,"" Sommers said.

Overall, the oil industry favors Republican control of the government and a light touch on their activities. Executives at the conference repeatedly complained about the Biden administration's pause on new liquefied natural gas export permits and called the EPA's new rule cracking down on methane emissions ""unworkable.""

Toby Rice, chief executive of EQT, the largest natural gas producer in the United States, did not comment on the possibilities of a Trump administration when asked. But he said in an interview that ""it's hard to imagine"" an administration more difficult to work with than Biden's.

""We have seen punitive policies and executive orders,"" Rice said. ""We've seen punitive interpretations by the agencies on how the law should be acted out. It has been incredibly confusing.""

Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt countered that not only has oil and gas production reached record levels despite the administration's regulatory changes, but jobs in the oil and gas sector have also grown after falling during the Trump years.

""I think the record is pretty clear here,"" she said, citing government data for the jobs growth under Biden. She added, ""President Biden did that all while enacting the most sweeping climate change legislation in our country's history -- proving once again that job growth and fighting climate change go hand in hand.""

Along with trade, some industry executives also expressed worries about Trump's penchant to put staunch supporters in top policy roles rather than people with years of expertise.

One LNG executive said the industry blamed Biden climate ""ideologues"" for much of what the industry didn't like about the White House's energy policy. But those executive branch officials are basically competent in day-to-day dealings, said this person, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.

The first Trump administration churned through many of the top GOP energy people after a series of scandals at agencies like the Interior Department and EPA caused internal strife and led to a steady stream of resignations. It also faced blowback from announcing policy decisions that hadn't gone through the official rule-making process.

Many of their replacements were considered ""the B team,"" and a new administration would likely have to settle ""a C or D Team"" staff taking the helm at key agencies, said this person, who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record.

""We'd go from steady conditions and a process-orientated administration back to chaos,"" the person said.

Those sentiments align with industry experience in the first Trump administration. While the former president has been a strong vocal supporter of the oil industry, his steel tariffs dramatically increased the cost of building new pipelines and other infrastructure, and his trade war with China temporarily took one of the biggest buyers of U.S. natural gas out of the market.

Others doubted Trump could repeal the Inflation Reduction Act completely even if he wanted to. Too many of the incentives found in the bill have flowed to new manufacturing facilities and renewable energy projects in Republican-led states, and oil companies are eager to use tax credits in the law to develop technology to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.

""A lot of Republican states benefit also from the [renewable energy] industry and from the IRA, with jobs, etc.,"" Marcel van Poecke, chair of the energy portfolio at private equity Carlyle Group, said in an interview. ""So maybe it's not as big a change as we think"" if Trump wins the White House in November.

Still, Carlyle, which manages $486 billion in assets, was hedging its bets in the sector, Van Poecke said. The fund was holding on to its investments in the oil and gas business even as it builds its renewable energy portfolio as ""a hedge against government regulations"" that could change, he said.

Consulting company Capstone DC was advising its corporate clients that a Trump administration would likely leave IRA provisions that favor industry in place. But the ""consumer-facing"" benefits -- such as tax credits for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency improvements -- would likely face the ax, Josh Price, head of the firm's energy team said in an interview.

Even if a Trump White House gutted incentives, the oil and gas industry is set to continue investing in clean energy and emissions reductions, said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group that works with oil companies to help reduce their methane emissions.

""A number of people have said to me, 'Listen, if we invest in clean energy technologies, it's not because of the subsidy,'"" Brownstein said. ""They're not interested in business models heavily dependent on subsidies.""

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods echoed that sentiment. Exxon, which has made investments in carbon capture and lithium processing for batteries, is pursuing those businesses because company officials think they can make money, not because of subsidies, Woods told the audience. The tax incentives in the IRA were needed to kick start new clean energy technologies, but eventually industry would have to live without government support.

""As a company, I'm not too keen on building businesses on government subsidies,"" Woods said.

Georges Tijbosch, chief executive officer of MiQ, a firm that measures greenhouse gas emissions, said a Trump administration could easily quash policies like the Federal Trade Commission's proposed crackdown on false ""green"" advertising.

But too strong a push to rip up rules on greenhouse gas emissions could backfire, he said, since a major reversal in policies could undermine the green credentials U.S. companies are advertising.

""There is a clear trend in dealing with climate change,"" Tijbosch said. ""Cities and corporations are going to do what they were doing anyway"" even if Trump tries to slash methane rules.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.07450980392156858,448906082,26,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L_zxUZ4xYDHZjERJj93jkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/a4747ac8f1a8abdb2f4bd1176aa4c372,

According to a 2022 report from Technavio, ""The avocado oil market size is forecasted to grow by USD 516.45 million"" over the next 5 years, and SmartBrief notes that ""the prevalence of avocado oil was identified as one of the 10 major food trends of 2023 by Whole Foods Market.""

There's just one problem -- a lot of the ""avocado oil"" we see on shelves is fake.

This is a claim made by TikTok user Sammie Mancine (@sammiemancine) in a video with over 669,000 views as of Saturday morning. But is it true?

""Want to know what I learned today? I learned that they just did a study on avocado oil and found that 82% of the oil was actually rancid or mixed with other oils such as canola oil,"" she says in her video.

""I learned that there is no regulations on avocado oil, so they can kind of go rogue here. And all of this is just a great new marketing scheme,"" she adds. ""I love this country so much.""

Unbelievably, what Mancine is saying is largely true, though the information she uses is a bit out of date.

A 2020 study conducted by UC Davis found that, as Mancine stated, ""At least 82 percent of test samples [of avocado oil] were either stale before expiration date or mixed with other oils.""

""In three cases, bottles labeled as 'pure' or 'extra virgin' avocado oil contained near 100 percent soybean oil, an oil commonly used in processed foods that's much less expensive to produce,"" an article on the study continues.

As Mancine noted, one of the reasons for this is the unregulated nature of avocado oil production. The same article states, ""The Food and Drug Administration has not yet adopted 'standards of identity' [for avocado oil], which are basic food standards designed to protect consumers from being cheated by inferior products or confused by misleading labels.""

That said, things are getting better. UC Davis conducted a similar study in 2023 and found that ""nearly 70% of private label avocado oil rancid or mixed with other oils"" -- a significant improvement from just a few years prior.

Regardless of how much the situation has improved, commenters were not too thrilled about this information.

""This is why i started cooking with beef tallow,"" a user said.

""That makes sense bc half the bottles of avo oil I've gotten smelled bad and I couldn't use them,"" shared another.

""So are we going back to coconut oil? Butter? Ugh it never ends,"" stated a third.

The deal will be implemented through Singapore-based SEVI Trade and Marketing Company Limited, a subsidiary of the German energy insurance company for Europe, CEVI.

Last January, the company already signed a similar ten-year agreement to supply half a million tonnes of gas per year to GAIL Limited, India's largest natural gas company.

As ADNOC announced in a statement, deliveries are expected to start in 2028.

With Germany, Abu Dhabi continues to strengthen its plans to sell liquefied natural gas through long-term contracts in an effort to compete with Qatar, the Middle East's largest producer.

Emirates has increased its investment in gas as a transition fuel as the world seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Europe seeks to secure new partners in the sector in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

ADNOC's plan aims to link the components of a value chain to this sector in the UAE to secure natural gas supplies and meet growing demand in local and global markets.

As such, the Ruwais complex in Abu Dhabi is expected to double liquefied natural gas production to approximately 15 million tonnes per year. Currently production is around six million tonnes.

""Gas covers almost a quarter of Germany's primary energy use and we look forward to supporting its efforts to improve energy security and diversify its sources,"" said Fatima Al Nuaimi, executive vice president of ADNOC's Gas Processing, Refining and Petrochemicals Business Department, following the agreement with Berlin.

""The pact to supply gas from the Ruwais low-emission project, which is the first of its kind with a European company, strengthens ADNOC's position as a reliable and responsible global energy supplier,"" she added.

A final decision on the Ruwais investment is expected later this year, although the project has already started preliminary work. This month, ADNOC announced that a joint consortium led by Technip Energies and including GGC Corporation and National Petroleum Construction will carry out initial engineering and construction work.

Using electricity from sustainable sources, it will be one of the lowest carbon-intensive gas-fired facilities in the world, contributing to ADNOC's ambitious goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2045.

Once completed, the project will consist of two natural gas liquefaction lines, each with a production capacity of 4.8 million tonnes per year and a total capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per year.

However, ADNOC is not the only regional company increasingly focusing on gas, as Saudi oil giant Aramco is also looking for space in the sector.

Qatar, which represents the largest gas market in the region, also recently announced a further expansion of the North Field project, a move that will strengthen its position as one of the world's largest gas exporters.

ADNOC Gas, established at the end of 2022, officially started operations in early 2023 in order to reap the benefits of the gas projects, as the country has the seventh largest reserves in the world.

ADNOC Gas' production capacity is approximately 10 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day, so the company can offer its services to a large group of local and international customers through a broad product portfolio.

The Emirati state-owned company covers about 60% of the local market needs and also exports natural gas and other products to a group of customers in more than twenty countries",atalayar.com,news,Atalayar,Margarita Arredondas,0.3176470588235294,448905685,1,https://www.atalayar.com/media/atalayar/images/2024/03/07/2024030717012518657.jpg,

Thessaloniki, or Niki as some call it, is the second largest city in Greece and it the capital of the Macedonia region.

Best known for its ""25 hour culture"" and stunning coastlines, it is the ultimate overlooked holiday destination.

Luckily, Ryanair are offering flights for just €19.99 on April 6, and the vibrant city is just an hour and 40 minutes from Dublin.

Temperatures in Niki can reach 30C in the height of summer, but spring is a more comfortable 23- 25C.

Nowadays, Niki is known for being a bustling party city, with many nightclubs staying open well into the morning.

Valaoritou Street houses many of the city's bars and clubs, each with its own style and music taste.

The street is also home to the Malakopi Arcade, where you can find more unique spots for a drink and a sing-song.

Vogue is one of the city's busiest nightclubs, with over 1,000 people fitting inside to dance the night away.

If you're a night owl, Vogue is the place for you, as the best acts don't start until after midnight.

The club, which doubles as a concert venue, stays open until 6 am.

If live music is more your scene than a DJ, check out Malt n' Jazz - one of the oldest and well known bars in the city.

Malt n' Jazz has been hosting live shows for over two decades and continues to host bands of all kinds.

The bar, which stays open until 4am, also serve delicious cocktails.

An unmissable spot is the city's skyline bar, where you can take in the view while sipping a delicious cocktail.

To recover from a night out, try relaxing on one of Niki's many stunning beaches.

Like much of Greece, Niki boasts white sand and crytal blue water beaches, where you can spend a say sipping cocktails and soaking up the sun.

Asprovalta Beach on the east side of the city is a popular tourist resort area where you can rent a sunbed for the day.

Likewise, Perrea Beach has stunning clear water and lines of sunbeds available, many of them with Instagram-worthy straw umbrellas.

The beach also has a vivid nightlife scene after dark, so make sure to stick around after sunset.

But a trip to Niki isn't just nightclubs and beaches - the city has a rich and fascinating history.

It is known by many for its beautiful architecture and historical artefacts.

The White Tower of Thessaloniki is one of the city's most famous landmarks, located right on the water.

The tower was built in the 15 century and today is home to a museum where you can learn all about the city's history.

The tower has a fascinating history, like the fact that it was painted white by a prisoner in exchange for his freedom.

The Arch of Galerius and Rotunda is also one of the most historical points in the city, dating back to 298 AD.

It was originally part of the a huge palace belonging to Galerius himself, but the palace was destroyed by earthquakes, leaving only the arch today.

The Museum of Thessaloniki is a perfect stop for anyone wanting to know more about the city's rich history.

It houses sculptures, monuments and armour dating back to the Roman empire, all inside a stunning Greek building.

If you have the time on your Niki trip, there are many day trips available and well worth doing.

For example, you can travel to Mount Olympus, which, in Greek mythology, was the home of the Gods and Goddesses.

The trip will take you to the top of the mountain where you can see breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.

Or why not try Pozar Thermal Baths and Edessa Day Trip for a truly unique and nature-inspired day out?

On this trip, you can see the countryside surrounding Niki and relax in the natural rock baths heated by hot springs.

Though you might think of the Greek Islands or the old town in Athens for a trip to Greece, Niki should not be overlooked.

NFL fans have been left stunned by L'Jarius Sneed's bombshell Friday night trade from Super Bowl winners Kansas City Chiefs to the Tennessee Titans.

Sneed, 27, is set to earn an average of $19m over four years, with $55m guaranteed and the move will be official once he has completed his medical.

The cornerback was outstanding last season as the Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl.

His standout moment was a magnificent tackle on Zay Flowers of the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth quarter of the NFL Conference Championship game, punching the ball out of his grasp as he leapt for a touchdown.

But he will now be bringing his game to Tennessee next year, and as the shockwaves started to be felt around the NFL, fans were quick to conclude it that it is a massive blow for the Chiefs.

Chiefs star L'Jarius Sneed is reportedly close to joining the Tennessee Titans in a $76m deal

Sneed was outstanding last season as Kansas City won their second straight Super Bowl

NFL fans were shocked by the move - some said it ends Chiefs hopes of a three-peat

'He was the main reason they three peat!!! It's over. The dynasty ended today. Watch in 11 months,' said one fan on X.

Another wrote: 'Chiefs got robbed in broad daylight.'

But for the fans in Tennessee, it was a landmark moment for a team that has never won a Super Bowl and missed out on the playoffs last year.

'I'm having a hard time getting some sleep after my Titans got L'Jarius Sneed in a trade from the Kansas City Chiefs. I'm excited for the 2024 season. What a free agency season for my Tennessee Titans,' wrote one Titans fan.

An Atlanta Falcons fan was stunned by the news, writing on X: 'The Chiefs trading L'Jarius Sneed should be breaking news today if you ask me. He was his own island in the Playoffs and too many WR's went missing on it.'

In the aftermath of Kansas City's win over the 49ers, Sneed was clear that he wanted a big pay packet - from the Chiefs or somewhere else.

When he made an appearance on the Up & Adams show days after the Vegas victory, he was asked if he had a message for GM Bret Veach as he approached free agency.

'Pay me,' Sneed said. 'Pay me, pay me. That's what I've got to say - pay me.'

The Titans had already signed cornerback Chidobe Aquzie during free agency.

They have also added the likes of wide receiver Calvin Ridley, center Lloyd Cushenberry and running back Tony Pollard to the roster this offseason.",expressdigest.com,news,expressdigest.com,Jack Bezants,0.5529411764705883,448905454,1,,

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 144 Fahrenheit on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""",nbcnews.com,news,NBC News,Associated Press,-0.1686274509803921,448904901,1,"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240323-taylor-swift-brazil-ch-1137-996de6.jpg",

Police were trying to confirm her identity. She is believed to be in her 20s.

The shooting happened about 5:48 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Serv gas station, 2200 East 12th Street.

The woman was pronounced dead at the station.

It was not immediately clear if the woman had driven to the station to purchase gas or something from the store.

Investigators are trying to determine a motive for the killing. No suspect information has been released.

The killing is the 18th homicide investigated by Oakland police this year. Last year at this time police had investigated 24 homicides in the city.

Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering up to $10,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the killer. Anyone with information may call police at 510-238-3821 or 510-238-7950 or Crime Stoppers at 510-777-8572.

The gas station has been the scene of several shootings in the past few years.

After conducting various activities in the past 22 months, the quintet recently took up the task of helping birds quench their thirst during the summer. The group, which founded Smile Foundation Kerala, an Alappuzha-based non-governmental organisation, with the aid of volunteers placed bird water feeders at 100 places in the districts of Alappuzha, Kollam, and Pathanamthitta in recent weeks.

The hanging water pots are refilled regularly with the help of educational institutions and nature lovers, among others.

'Karuthal Thullikal'

""Feathered friends have a higher body temperature than humans. Birds are susceptible to dehydration, and other health problems in the summer as they find it hard to get access to clean drinking water. This prompted us to launch the 'Karuthal Thullikal' initiative. We aim to ensure clean water for as many birds as possible and help them survive this scorching summer heat,"" says J. Hashim, chairperson, Smile Foundation Kerala. Mr. Hashim, a Forest department official, currently works as a tutor after taking leave from government service.

The group initially put earthen bowls with water at different places at Nooranad in Alappuzha, best known as 'pakshi gramam' (bird village). Later they placed pots at other places and distributed them free of cost to schools, government offices, and so on.

One of the schools that joined hands with the foundation to quench the thirst of birds is Vayanakam Vocational Higher Secondary School (VHSS), Oachira in Kollam. Water pots hanging from tree branches on the school compound are filled by students.

""Two weeks have passed since water bowls got placed. A good number of birds are drinking water from it. Once the school is closed for summer holidays, peons will fill the bowls,"" says R. Prasanna Kumar, manager, Vayanakam VHSS.

Donations not accepted

The foundation does not accept donations and carries out various activities using money collected from within the group.

""Apart from environmental activities, we have undertaken educational, and healthcare, among other programmes, in the past two years,"" says L. Sajikumar, joint secretary of the foundation, who is also a tutor and Palamel grama panchayat ward member.

Other activities of the group include free distribution of saplings to schools and the general public, study materials to students from poor economic backgrounds, and anti-drug and blood donation campaigns. Recently, it organised protests and awareness programmes against soil extraction by levelling a hillock at Mattappally in Palamel.

Other office-bearers of the foundation are Annie A. (secretary), A. Alfin (treasurer), and Savitha (vice chairperson).

The analysis, published this week by the climate think tank Carbon Tracker, found that none of the 25 biggest oil and gas companies are currently considered to be ""Paris compliant,"" that is; in alignment with the 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit set under the Paris climate accord.

In fact, the report found that fossil fuel behemoths ConocoPhillips, Saudi Aramco, Pioneer, and ExxonMobil were ranked as the furthest from meeting those goals.

The report graded companies using a five-metric rubric; measuring current and future operations, investment options, production plans, newly approved projects, and emissions reduction targets.

They were then assigned scores ranging from 'A' through 'H,' with 'A' representing the closest to full alignment Paris warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 'H' representing the furthest from alignment with this target, with activities and investments that yield a temperature increase of at least 2.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

The best-scoring company was BP, which received a letter grade of D-, the report found, while ConocoPhillips received the lowest-ranking score of an H.

Three of the five lowest-scoring companies -- Exxon Mobil, Pioneer, and ConocoPhillips -- are also U.S.-based.

The report comes as oil and gas firms have pledged to clean up their industry and reduce emissions and practices such as venting and flaring, which is known to emit large amounts of methane and other harmful greenhouse gases.

But they have also scaled up plans for production in recent months, citing an uptick in projected global demand as the world looks to build out dependable, dispatchable emissions-free sources of power.

Speaking at an oil and gas industry conference in Houston earlier this week, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said companies should shift their focus toward cleaner technologies rather than the transition to renewable energy resources.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,"" Nasser said at CERAWeek, hosted by S&P Global.

The report highlights the disparity between the company's pledges and investments on climate change and their actions in this space, said Carbon Tracker analyst Maeve O'Connor, who co-authored the report.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" O'Connor said.

""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies,"" she added.

Which is understandable, of course - the plant's seeds are best known for their fragrance and are used as an aromatic spice and as an ingredient in many perfumes. But while its nutritional and medicinal value are not as emphasized, they should not at all be ignored.

Anise is native to the Anatolian Peninsula but was soon cultivated in ancient Greece and Egypt. Over the centuries, its use has spread to different parts of the globe. Anise should not be confused with star anise which, while having an almost similar scent, actually has a different set of health benefits.

In the distant past, it was used mostly for its culinary and medicinal benefits. For instance, it was used as a treatment for gastrointestinal problems, specifically, for relieving distension and soothing cramping that results from the accumulation of gas. It was also used to relieve coughing and hiccups.

Among native Amazonians, the seeds were regarded as a gentle treatment for stomach aches in children. In Iranian medicine, it was given to patients as an analgesic for migraines. It was also used as an antiseptic and in aromatic, carminative, and diuretic treatments. Traditional texts in other cultures listed it for more complex conditions like nightmares, melancholy, and epilepsy.

Modern research has uncovered a slew of other benefits. For instance, some studies have indicated the seeds' ability, in combination with other plants and seeds, to relieve constipation by acting as a laxative. The seeds were also found to address dyspepsia.

Some human trials have been conducted to examine the benefits of anise on menopausal women. These tests found that the seeds can reduce the intensity and number of hot flashes in the participants. This effect was attributed to the seeds containing phytoestrogen, chemicals in plants that act like the estrogen produced in the human body.

Animal studies confirmed anise's anticonvulsant properties, or its ability to stop seizures brought about by conditions like epilepsy. The researchers noted that anise's dose-dependent effects were ""more satisfactory"" than what the conventional anti-seizure drug phenobarbital offered. Anise effectively reduced the severity and frequency of the seizures.

Anise is noted to have potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal properties that suggest it may be used to preserve food by preventing the growth and proliferation of pathogens. These same traits also gave it potential benefits as an anti-cancer treatment.

Anise's essential oil is notable for its trans-anethole content. It also has a variety of phytochemicals that have been linked to various health benefits. These include coumarins, flavonoids, and various aromatic oil components.

These phytochemicals enable anise to provide various health benefits besides the ones mentioned above. These include:

Stomach problems - Anise works for just about any basic gastrointestinal problem. It also treats vomiting, nausea, and gastritis, and stimulates appetite.

Insomnia - Boiling anise seed and drinking the fluid as tea after meals or before bed can aid in getting high-quality sleep.

Asthma - Anise's expectorant qualities make it great not just for a cough, but also for asthma.

Menstrual problems - The seeds' phytoestrogen content is great for women with irregular menstruation. It can also help women who have problems producing milk.

Lice - Anise can be used as a gentle insecticide for head lice. It can also be used for mites and scabies.

Oral issues - Its antimicrobial effects make anise the ideal component of a natural mouthwash. Its fragrance is a huge bonus.

Sexual dysfunction - Drinking water infused with anise may help improve libido. The seeds may also help improve symptoms of so-called ""male menopause.""

Heat players have missed the NBA's fourth-most games due to injury after missing the eighth-most last season. The Heat is 27th in scoring (ahead of only lottery-bound Portland, Charlotte and Memphis) and 23rd in offensive rating (points per 100 possessions).

What's more, the Heat is just 17-16 at home -- the worst home record among top nine seeds in either conference -- and 1-9 at home against top five seeds, heading into Sunday's home game against third-seeded Cleveland (6 p.m., Bally Sports Sun). That's not a good sign for a team that plays nine of its final 12 at home.

And Miami's chances of avoiding the play-in grow more tenuous; the Heat (38-32) is seventh (1 1/2 games behind No. 6 Indiana) and would host No. 8 Philadelphia - which has the same record - in a play-in game if the season mysteriously ended today.

Meanwhile, two significant decisions loom for postseason: Who's the starting shooting guard, presuming Tyler Herro makes it back from a foot injury by the end of the season and Duncan Robinson (back) returns fairly soon, as expected?

And who's the starting power forward: Nikola Jovic, Caleb Martin or even Haywood Highsmith? It's looking increasingly like Jovic will keep that role.

Jovic has started the past 14 games that he has been available. That, combined with revealing comments from Erik Spoelstra, strongly suggest that the coach would like to make this Bam Adebayo/Jovic starting power rotation work - unless Jovic gives him reason to abandon it before the playoffs.

""The one thing I do know is they both have great skill levels,"" Spoelstra said recently. ""And it's almost inverted with us, when two bigs can handle. They both can pass. They both can make plays. They can both finish at the rim. And they both feel very comfortable just being facilitators.

""That adds to the diversity of our menu. And Niko also helps us run more, which I like. I think the players hopefully like that, if they can get some easy baskets. His passing and skill level, size, all of those things fit.""

When Jovic has played with Adebayo and Jimmy Butler this season, Miami has outscored teams by 6.5 points per 48 minutes. That compares with a plus 9.5 per 48 minutes for the troika of Butler, Adebayo and Highsmith - a group that started together for a time earlier this season.

Even though Caleb Martin thrived alongside Butler and Adebayo during the playoffs last year - the Heat is just a plus 0.9 per 48 minutes with Butler, Adebayo and Martin on the court together this season.

Which of those three lineups produces the most offense?

Surprisingly, the Highsmith/Butler/Adebayo group, though that's skewed by strong offensive games from Heat guards on some of those nights.

Miami has averaged 116.7 points per 48 minutes and shot 50.4 percent from the field and 40.1 percent on threes with those three on the floor together this season.

With Butler, Adebayo and Jovic, Miami averages 110.9 points per 48 minutes and is shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.6 percent on threes. (Jovic is shooting 41.6 on threes this season.)

With Butler, Adebayo and Martin, Miami is averaging just 107.9 points per 48 minutes.

Butler and Adebayo have played 284 minutes with Highsmith, 258 with Martin and 214 with Jovic.

""He's a great passer,"" Adebayo said of Jovic. ""When you play alongside somebody like that who can also pass, it just makes your offense more dynamic. Just being able to get it off the rim and just be able to push and make plays for himself, I feel like that's his biggest improvement.""

If Jovic plays well as a starter for the next three weeks - and if the Heat does a lot of winning - he figures to remain a starter heading into the playoffs.

But if the Heat plays Boston in the playoffs, keep this in mind: Jayson Tatum is 5 for his last 23 when Highsmith is guarding him.

STARTING SHOOTING GUARD

The notion of Herro not starting hasn't been a consideration since he moved into the starting lineup at the start of last season, after winning the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award the previous season.

But if Robinson returns from a back injury sooner than Herro returns from a foot injury - and if Robinson resumes playing well - a decision looms for postseason.

Lineups featuring Butler, Adebayo and Robinson have been slightly better than lineups featuring Butler, Adebayo and Herro this season, but it's negligible.

The Heat has averaged 113.8 points per 48 minutes and outscored teams by 5.7 points per 48 minutes when Butler, Adebayo and Robinson are on the floor together this season. They've played 385 minutes together.

The Heat has averaged 112.5 points per 48 and outscored teams by 5.2 points per 48 minutes when Butler, Adebayo and Herro are on the floor together this season. They'll played 404 minutes together.

Miami has shot three-pointers better with the Herro/Butler/Adebayo trio than the Robinson/Butler/Adebayo group (41.7 percent to 39.4 percent).

Spoelstra seems bullish on a Herro/Rozier pairing; he has repeatedly spoken of the possibilities of that backcourt.

But they've played just 180 minutes together, and Miami has been outscored by 4.0 points per 48 minutes when they're on the floor at the same time.

But the Rozier/Robinson pairing hasn't produced great team results, either; Miami has been outscored by 2.9 points per 48 minutes and shot just 32.5 percent on threes in their 361 minutes together.

Miami has averaged 112.8 points per 48 minutes with Rozier and Herro playing together, compared with just 104.1 per 48 with Rozier and Robinson.

For now, Miami's shooting and spacing are at a deficit with Herro, Robinson and Kevin Love (heel) all out. How much does Miami miss them?

""A lot,"" Adebayo said. ""You can't replace a guy like Duncan who shoots from anywhere, and Tyler, who creates his own shot and the leadership of K-Love.""

In shooting 27.7 percent on threes against New Orleans on Friday, Miami missed 34 three-pointers, three short of the franchise record.

PELICANS GLOAT

New Orleans enjoyed its 111-88 Friday night drubbing of the Heat, especially after Jimmy Butler had said that Miami had the better team and would beat the Pelicans for an eight consecutive time on Friday.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans organization tweeted afterward, mocking Butler.

After the game, Butler said he stood by those comments: ""I hope it added fuel to the fire. That's fine. They had a great game plan, they made shots. They came here and stole one. I'm going to stick by what I said. We're still the better team. You can't win them all. We should have won that one. We damn sure should have. But we'll be alright.""

Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado said Butler's comments ""backfired on them today. Hopefully, we see them again in a more important game, in the NBA Final.""

And New Orleans coach Willie Green said: ""They said some things in the media. We heard it and we wanted to respond.""",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,Barry Jackson,-0.192156862745098,448903379,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/91469254f6ddbe6c4bcd2018a6711edb,

(AP) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda joined California Gov. Gavin Newsom and environmental advocates in Los Angeles on Friday to launch a campaign to keep a 2022 law banning new oil and gas wells near homes, schools and hospitals.

The law bans new wells within 3,200 feet (975 meters) of certain community sites, and proponents say it will protect residents from the health impacts of pollution. It hasn't taken effect after the oil industry qualified a referendum to ask voters to overturn it in November.

At a Los Angeles park with an oil pump jack in the background behind him, Newsom said keeping the law is a key part of advancing the state's climate goals.

""Big Oil is the polluting heart of this climate crisis,"" Newsom said. ""Thank you for being here today, tomorrow, and thank you for being there on Election Day, when we send a powerful message -- not just here in the state of California, but heard all across the United States.""

Newsom is backing a lawsuit claiming oil and gas companies deceived the public about the risks of fossil fuels. It's part of his efforts to fortify California's status as a climate leader as the state transitions away from fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks and trains.

The California Independent Petroleum Association, which is pushing for voters to overturn the law, is concerned about how it will impact the oil and gas industry, which generates large amounts of state and local tax revenue.

Newsom signed a law last year that was inspired in part by oil industry tactics, which have come under scrutiny, to collect enough signatures to get the referendum on the ballot. The law requires top funders pushing a referendum proposal to overturn a law to be listed on voter information guides released by the state. It also requires a referendum on the ballot to ask voters to ""keep the law"" or ""overturn the law,"" a departure from asking them to vote ""yes"" to keep the law or ""no"" to block it.

Lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would have made oil companies pay up to $1 million to people with cancer or other health problems associated with a well, but it was blocked by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Nalleli Cobo, an environmental activist who grew up near an oil well in Los Angeles, said she started experiencing nosebleeds, heart palpitations and headaches as a child and was diagnosed with reproductive cancer at age 19. She has since worked to fight against the health impacts of the oil industry and wants voters to keep the law limiting the location of new oil and gas wells.

When Jovic has played with Adebayo and Jimmy Butler this season, Miami has outscored teams by 6.5 points per 48 minutes. That compares with a plus 9.5 per 48 minutes for the troika of Butler, Adebayo and Highsmith - a group that started together for a time earlier this season.

Even though Caleb Martin thrived alongside Butler and Adebayo during the playoffs last year - the Heat is just a plus 0.9 per 48 minutes with Butler, Adebayo and Martin on the court together this season.

Which of those three lineups produces the most offense?

Surprisingly, the Highsmith/Butler/Adebayo group, though that's skewed by strong offensive games from Heat guards on some of those nights.

Miami has averaged 116.7 points per 48 minutes and shot 50.4 percent from the field and 40.1 percent on threes with those three on the floor together this season.

With Butler, Adebayo and Jovic, Miami averages 110.9 points per 48 minutes and is shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.6 percent on threes. (Jovic is shooting 41.6 on threes this season.)

With Butler, Adebayo and Martin, Miami is averaging just 107.9 points per 48 minutes.

Butler and Adebayo have played 284 minutes with Highsmith, 258 with Martin and 214 with Jovic.

""He's a great passer,"" Adebayo said of Jovic. ""When you play alongside somebody like that who can also pass, it just makes your offense more dynamic. Just being able to get it off the rim and just be able to push and make plays for himself, I feel like that's his biggest improvement.""

If Jovic plays well as a starter for the next three weeks - and if the Heat does a lot of winning - he figures to remain a starter heading into the playoffs.

But if the Heat plays Boston in the playoffs, keep this in mind: Jayson Tatum is 5 for his last 23 when Highsmith is guarding him.

STARTING SHOOTING GUARD

The notion of Herro not starting hasn't been a consideration since he moved into the starting lineup at the start of last season, after winning the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award the previous season.

But if Robinson returns from a back injury sooner than Herro returns from a foot injury - and if Robinson resumes playing well - a decision looms for postseason.

Lineups featuring Butler, Adebayo and Robinson have been slightly better than lineups featuring Butler, Adebayo and Herro this season, but it's negligible.

The Heat has averaged 113.8 points per 48 minutes and outscored teams by 5.7 points per 48 minutes when Butler, Adebayo and Robinson are on the floor together this season. They've played 385 minutes together.

The Heat has averaged 112.5 points per 48 and outscored teams by 5.2 points per 48 minutes when Butler, Adebayo and Herro are on the floor together this season. They'll played 404 minutes together.

Miami has shot three-pointers better with the Herro/Butler/Adebayo trio than the Robinson/Butler/Adebayo group (41.7 percent to 39.4 percent).

Spoelstra seems bullish on a Herro/Rozier pairing; he has repeatedly spoken of the possibilities of that backcourt.

But they've played just 180 minutes together, and Miami has been outscored by 4.0 points per 48 minutes when they're on the floor at the same time.

But the Rozier/Robinson pairing hasn't produced great team results, either; Miami has been outscored by 2.9 points per 48 minutes and shot just 32.5 percent on threes in their 361 minutes together.

Miami has averaged 112.8 points per 48 minutes with Rozier and Herro playing together, compared with just 104.1 per 48 with Rozier and Robinson.

For now, Miami's shooting and spacing are at a deficit with Herro, Robinson and Kevin Love (heel) all out. How much does Miami miss them?

""A lot,"" Adebayo said. ""You can't replace a guy like Duncan who shoots from anywhere, and Tyler, who creates his own shot and the leadership of K-Love.""

In shooting 27.7 percent on threes against New Orleans on Friday, Miami missed 34 three-pointers, three short of the franchise record.

PELICANS GLOAT

New Orleans enjoyed its 111-88 Friday night drubbing of the Heat, especially after Jimmy Butler had said that Miami had the better team and would beat the Pelicans for an eight consecutive time on Friday.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans organization tweeted afterward, mocking Butler.

After the game, Butler said he stood by those comments: ""I hope it added fuel to the fire. That's fine. They had a great game plan, they made shots. They came here and stole one. I'm going to stick by what I said. We're still the better team. You can't win them all. We should have won that one. We damn sure should have. But we'll be alright.""

Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado said Butler's comments ""backfired on them today. Hopefully, we see them again in a more important game, in the NBA Final.""

And New Orleans coach Willie Green said: ""They said some things in the media. We heard it and we wanted to respond.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,Barry Jackson,-0.192156862745098,448902875,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/91469254f6ddbe6c4bcd2018a6711edb,

Williams, 23, appeared in court in Crewe in relation to the 2023 crash. The footballer, who has been capped by England at Under-21 level, denies dangerous driving, did not accept responsibility for the accident, and denies he was impaired and that he had no insurance.

Magistrates have referred the footballer's case to Chester Crown Court, with a hearing date of April 19 set. WIlliams has been granted unconditional bail.

Laughing gas, also known as nitrous oxide, was banned in the UK in November 2023. Those found in possession of the substance on multiple occasions can face prison sentences, while possession alone can bring a community punishment, a caution or an unlimited fine.

""Today we are sending a clear signal to people, especially young people, that not only is abuse of nitrous oxide dangerous to their health, but it is also illegal and those caught possessing it will face consequences,"" policing minister Chris Philp said when the measures came in.

""For too long the use of this drug in public spaces has contributed to anti-social behaviour which is a blight on communities. We will not accept it. This law gives the police the powers they need to take a zero-tolerance approach to this crime.""

WIliams, who is under contract with United until the end of the 2023-24 season, last appeared in a matchday squad for them in May 2023. He was loaned out to Ipswich Town for the 2023-24 season but has not featured since December.

""Kieran [Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna] was my youth-team coach at United and, from there, we have had a great relationship,"" Williams said upon moving to Portman Road. ""He has always had the standards of a coach at the top level and has had a big influence on me.

""He has always kept in touch with me to make sure I'm okay and I trust everything he says because he is great to learn off. I'm excited to work with him again.""

Ipswich sit third in the Championship table after 38 games, but just one point behind leaders Leeds United. They have an option to make Williams' move permanent come the summer.

The main stars in the skirmish was Heat star Jimmy Butler and Pelicans forward Naji Marshall who each plus others were suspended after the game last month, but while Miami got the win then, New Orleans came back and were victorious, 111-88.

Butler was asked about the possibility of the Pelicans having a larger chip on their shoulder since they were facing the Heat which they've had bad blood with. The 34-year old star says that he hoped it did and ""that's fine,"" but still stands on his words by saying that ""we're still the better team.""

""I hope it added fuel to the fire. That's fine. They had a great game plan, they made shots. They came here and stole one. I'm going to stick by what I said. We're still the better team,"" Butler said. ""You can't win them all. We should have won that one. We damn sure should have. But we'll be alright.""

Pelicans poking fun at Heat and Butler for past comments

After the game in February, Butler was fired up and declared that not only are the Heat a better team than the Pelicans, but the next time they face off on their home floor, they will win. While this isn't out of the ordinary for Butler to be confident, statements like that can backfire if you don't get the result you want.

""We'll beat them the next time, too,"" Butler said that night. ""We're just the better team. We're not going to say that they're not a good team. But I don't think this really matters. I think that when we get them on our home court, it's going to be a different game. I hope they're healthy and it's going to be the same outcome.""

Marshall would post on his X (formerly known as Twitter) account a repost of Butler saying these words after Friday's Heat loss and said """"My Volume don't work what he say ?????"". The post was later deleted, despite being retweeted by the official Pelicans account on the social media platform. The Pelicans account would also poke fun at Butler by posting the final score and saying ""We're just a better team"" which was one of many that night.

Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra would comment briefly about the heated altercation and responded if the players are using it to be fueled even more or if they're putting it in the past. Spoelstra would say to ClutchPoints that it's in the rearview mirror as the confrontation is ""nothing compared to the 90s.""

""I think it's all behind,"" Spoelstra said when asked if the past altercation is still in the minds of the players. ""This is nothing compared to the 90s, really it was nothing.""

Heat's poor shooting performance was one of the worst all season

When it came to the actual game, it was arguably one of the more frustrating nights for the Heat as they had a poor performance in shooting the ball. They shot 36 percent from the field, but it was even more dreadful from the three-point line as they were 27.7 percent, missing a season-high 36 attempts from that range which is also the fifth-most in franchise history.

Butler would lead the team with 17 points to go along with five assists and four rebounds and mentioned how they played better in the first half, but the second half was when they got worse. He mentioned how the poor offense led to the same effort on defense.

""Definitely missing a lot of shots, but I think we were guarding better. Whenever we weren't making shots, we were still playing defense,"" Butler said. ""In the second half when we weren't making shots, we weren't getting back, weren't rebounding, we weren't standing in front of the ball...then it got out of hand.

Pelicans threw a lot of zone defense at the Heat which Spoelstra said after the game that it ""flattened"" them out during the process. Butler would comment on that saying they got ""stagnant"" and needed to ""be more aggressive.""

""We got stagnant, we were just passing the ball around the perimeter, we got to be better at attacking,"" Butler said. ""Anybody got drive that bad baby into the paint and pass it to the weak side and find the open guy, we just got to do a better job of that, be more aggressive, in transition. All of those things we didn't do tonight, if we would have, then we would've been alright.""

Butler talking offense dictating defense and middling home record

For Butler, the performance was all too similar to previous losses in the season where if the shots were not falling for Miami, it would ""dictate our defense in the sense of we don't guard nobody."" While the famed ""Heat Culture"" is known for out hustling any other team on any given night, Friday was one of the worst examples of that.

""It's just a retelling of what's happened to us a couple of times this season where whenever we don't make shots, we tend to let our offense dictate our defense in the sense of we don't guard nobody,"" Butler said. ""We don't hustle as often as we should and the game gets very ugly when were doing what we're not supposed to be doing.""

The loss drops the home record to 17-16 which is middling compared to previous years where playing inside the Kaseya Center was an immense strength for the Heat. Butler would say to ClutchPoints that ""we don't think anybody is scared to come in here and play us.""

""Home or away, we have a job to do, we don't think anybody is scared to come in here and play us, don't think people are scared to play us on the road either,"" Butler said. ""Hopefully in the coming games we figure it out, put our heads down and get to work cause we definitely gotta start winning if we want to be where we want to be.""

Heat players have missed the NBA's fourth-most games due to injury after missing the eighth-most last season. The Heat is 27th in scoring (ahead of only lottery-bound Portland, Charlotte and Memphis) and 23rd in offensive rating (points per 100 possessions).

What's more, the Heat is just 17-16 at home -- the worst home record among top nine seeds in either conference -- and 1-9 at home against top five seeds, heading into Sunday's home game against third-seeded Cleveland (6 p.m., Bally Sports Sun). That's not a good sign for a team that plays nine of its final 12 at home.

And Miami's chances of avoiding the play-in grow more tenuous; the Heat (38-32) is seventh (1 1/2 games behind No. 6 Indiana) and would host No. 8 Philadelphia - which has the same record - in a play-in game if the season mysteriously ended today.

Meanwhile, two significant decisions loom for postseason: Who's the starting shooting guard, presuming Tyler Herro makes it back from a foot injury by the end of the season and Duncan Robinson (back) returns fairly soon, as expected?

And who's the starting power forward: Nikola Jovic, Caleb Martin or even Haywood Highsmith? It's looking increasingly like Jovic will keep that role.

Jovic has started the past 14 games that he has been available. That, combined with revealing comments from Erik Spoelstra, strongly suggest that the coach would like to make this Bam Adebayo/Jovic starting power rotation work - unless Jovic gives him reason to abandon it before the playoffs.

""The one thing I do know is they both have great skill levels,"" Spoelstra said recently. ""And it's almost inverted with us, when two bigs can handle. They both can pass. They both can make plays. They can both finish at the rim. And they both feel very comfortable just being facilitators.

""That adds to the diversity of our menu. And Niko also helps us run more, which I like. I think the players hopefully like that, if they can get some easy baskets. His passing and skill level, size, all of those things fit.""

When Jovic has played with Adebayo and Jimmy Butler this season, Miami has outscored teams by 6.5 points per 48 minutes. That compares with a plus 9.5 per 48 minutes for the troika of Butler, Adebayo and Highsmith - a group that started together for a time earlier this season.

Even though Caleb Martin thrived alongside Butler and Adebayo during the playoffs last year - the Heat is just a plus 0.9 per 48 minutes with Butler, Adebayo and Martin on the court together this season.

Which of those three lineups produces the most offense?

Surprisingly, the Highsmith/Butler/Adebayo group, though that's skewed by strong offensive games from Heat guards on some of those nights.

Miami has averaged 116.7 points per 48 minutes and shot 50.4 percent from the field and 40.1 percent on threes with those three on the floor together this season.

With Butler, Adebayo and Jovic, Miami averages 110.9 points per 48 minutes and is shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.6 percent on threes. (Jovic is shooting 41.6 on threes this season.)

With Butler, Adebayo and Martin, Miami is averaging just 107.9 points per 48 minutes.

Butler and Adebayo have played 284 minutes with Highsmith, 258 with Martin and 214 with Jovic.

""He's a great passer,"" Adebayo said of Jovic. ""When you play alongside somebody like that who can also pass, it just makes your offense more dynamic. Just being able to get it off the rim and just be able to push and make plays for himself, I feel like that's his biggest improvement.""

If Jovic plays well as a starter for the next three weeks - and if the Heat does a lot of winning - he figures to remain a starter heading into the playoffs.

But if the Heat plays Boston in the playoffs, keep this in mind: Jayson Tatum is 5 for his last 23 when Highsmith is guarding him.

That goal is now in limbo,"Over the past 20 years, Victor Ramirez has worked in warehouse after warehouse across southern California. And in almost all of them, he's felt painful, unbearable, oppressive heat. A few years ago, he fainted on the job. When he came to, his coworkers had tried to clean off the floor to give him a place to rest.

""Sientes como si estás adentro de un horno,"" he says in Spanish -- ""You feel like you're inside an oven.""

Ramirez and thousands of other indoor workers across California have been pushing for years for the state to make rules that would protect them from heat, especially as climate change ramps up the intensity and frequency of dangerous heat. They thought they were on the cusp of success.

This week, California's Occupational Health and Safety Administration's standards board (Cal/OSHA) was set tovote on rules that would have granted indoor workers the right to water, breaks, and cool-down areas when workplace temperatures topped 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Employers would have to use fans, air conditioning, or other methods to cool spaces, and adjust work tasks to account for increased heat fatigue when temperatures or the heat index exceeds 87 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat index is a measure that incorporates temperature and humidity, and more closely resembles the true feeling of heat.

California would have become only the third state in the U.S. to create rules protecting indoor workers from heat.

But heat rules have been running into strong political headwinds in many parts of the country -- even in climate-focused California. Florida is in the process of banning cities or counties from creating their own rules to protect workers from heat. And Texas successfully blocked local heat rules statewide last year, after several cities created statutes.

Stephen Knight, the executive director of WorkSafe -- a worker-focused advocacy group -- described the move as an ""enormous blow"" to California Governor Gavin Newsom's focus on addressing climate change. ""It was a real missed opportunity to take action to provide support and assistance and protections to the most vulnerable workers,"" he said.

California's proposed rules have not escaped the fierce opposition seen in other states.

A 2016 state lawtold state agencies to create an indoor heat rule by 2019. That deadline sailed past as advocates, industry, and Cal/OSHA negotiated hard over the rules.

After seven years, the rules had received sign-off from all necessary parties -- or so the Cal/OSHA standards board thought. Then, the night before the planned final vote, board members were instructed by the state's Department of Finance to pull the vote from the agenda, board chair David Thomas said during Thursday's meeting.

Without an official vote, the rules aren't able to move forward -- and are at risk, because of procedural issues, of being eliminated completely.

""We got blindsided today,"" Thomas said.

Workers from many different heat-impacted industries shared their disappointment.

""You have failed us,"" Raquel Saldaña, a janitor from San Diego, said in Spanish. She described suffocating conditions working in the summer when the air conditioning was off.

The board, taken aback by the last-minute directive, made an unprecedented move: they took an unofficial vote on the rules. The symbolic vote passed unanimously.

""We have a responsibility to the workers of California,"" Thomas said. The worsening heat risks mean the time pressure is on. ""[We have to] make sure that our people, our workers this summer are not subject to the same conditions that they have been in the past,"" he said.

Workers like Ramirez say there's no time to waste getting rules implemented. ""Cada vez que viene el verano, me siento preocupado,"" he says in Spanish -- ""Every time summer comes, I get worried."" And this summer is approaching quickly.

Ramirez is incensed that the rules, which would give indoor workers breaks, access to cool spaces to recuperate, and cool water on hot days, are now in limbo.

California ""debería de dar la muestra al resto del país, para mostrarles que aquí se respetan las vidas humanas,"" he says in Spanish -- the state ""should be an example for the rest of the country, to show them that here they respect human life.""

Heat exposure for indoor and outdoor workers is a growing risk for injury and even death nationwide. But creating worker protections from heat has proven a political challenge in different parts of the country in recent years.

There are no federal rules protecting workers from heat. In their absence, cities, counties, and states are left to create their own, but few have taken on the challenge.

Only four states -- California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado -- have rules protecting outdoor workers, like people in agriculture or construction, when temperatures get dangerously hot -- in the 80's. Only two states -- Minnesota and Oregon -- protect indoor workers.

""That means workers in 45 states across this country have no legal protections, no legal rights to protections from heat exposure from their employers,"" says Kevin Riley, director of the Labor Occupational Safety and Health program at UCLA.

Efforts to implement protections elsewhere have run into strong political headwinds. Last year, after several Texas cities issued rules mandating shade and water breaks for construction workers, the Texas legislature created a law to block them. Florida is in the process of passing a similar law to prevent cities or counties from making their own heat-protection rules for workers.

Oregon only implemented its heat protections after the Pacific Northwest's blistering 2021 heatwave, which killed hundreds. ""The fact of the matter is, we waited for someone to die before we did this,"" said Jamie Pang, the environmental health program director at the Oregon Environmental Council. Oregon's rules cover both indoor and outdoor workers.

""The chaos in California is just the latest reminder of why we need federal heat protections, stat,"" says Juanita Constible, a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some industry leaders are concerned the rules aren't clear enough, and that they'll be difficult or impossible for some businesses to implement, says Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce. Buildings for shipping businesses, for instance, often have walls, which means they count as an indoor workplace. But they also have giant doors that often open to the outdoor heat, which makes heat management inside complicated.

Many businesses store things in shipping containers or outdoor sheds. The rules about those spaces ""are not clear and feasible as drafted and so they won't really help the businesses trying to implement them,"" says Moutrie.

Restaurants are also in a tough position. Kitchens are often hot spaces, and some businesses don't have space for a required cool-down area -- and it's difficult or impossible to change heat exposure if an employee is cooking over an open flame, for instance.

California was the first state to successfully implement heat protections for outdoor workers, which have been in place since 2005.

Since then, human-driven climate change has significantly worsened heat risks. Eight of the state's 10 hottest-ever years have occurred since then. A 2022 heat wave killed nearly 300 people. Hundreds die from heat exposure in the state every year.

Cal/OSHA received reports of more than 500 heat-related workplace injuries last year. But the true number is likely much higher, says R. Jisung Park, an environmental economist at the University of Pennsylvania. He led a 2021 study that looked at workers' compensation claims from 2001 to 2018 across California and compared the injury records with daily temperatures.

Injuries were 5 to 7 percent higher on days when temperatures were between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to cooler days. Overall, the analysis estimated that working in uncomfortably hot conditions led to an extra 20,000 worker injuries a year in the state.

""If you're working on a 95 degree day, for instance, we're talking about an elevation in same-day injury risk of upwards of 10% or more. In some industries, it could be many times that,"" says Park.

Heat impairs people's ability to think clearly, and can make them clumsy or dizzy. That means all kinds of injuries can increase on hot days, not just obviously heat-influenced ones like fainting. ""Things like someone falling off of a ladder, someone getting hit by a moving crane, someone getting their hand caught in a piece of equipment,"" says Park -- similar to problems many workers described at the Cal/OSHA meeting this week.

The U.S. did drill its way to lower gas prices over the past several years (for both natural gas and gasoline) and broke the back of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the process.[4]

The doubling of U.S. oil production between 2008 and 2015 is an amazing story of American ingenuity, persistence, and, of course, drilling. The story is made more amazing by the fact that federal energy policy actively hindered this energy renaissance as it was taking place. In the first few months of the Obama Administration, the Department of the Interior cancelled oil and gas lease sales.[5] In 2011, the Obama Department of the Interior blocked access to most of America's offshore oil and gas reserves, placing a de facto moratorium on drilling.[6] The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) hostility to the oil and gas industry was exemplified by regional administrator and Obama appointee Al Armendariz, who was captured on tape explaining that his policy was to ""crucify"" select oil and gas firms in order to terrify the others.[7]

In spite of the Administration's policies, the energy sector thrived because of production on private and state-owned lands. As companies in the U.S. drilled their way to low petroleum prices, oil production from the federal estate was stagnant or declining.[8] So, it is reasonable to ask: What sort of energy powerhouse could the U.S. be with an energy policy that unleashes America's total energy potential?

In its Annual Energy Outlook, the federal government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) makes projections of energy production, consumption, and prices. The reference case assumes midpoint projections for energy resources and assumes that regulations follow their legislative timelines. As part of its sensitivity analysis, the EIA also produces two side cases where energy resources are assumed to be (a) 50 percent higher and (b) 50 percent lower than the reference case. Though these side cases are not intended to model policy changes, the High Resource Case offers a glimpse of what might be.

It should be noted that a 50 percent increase in resource availability is not a ""pie-in-the-sky"" fantasy. U.S. petroleum production in 2015 was about 50 percent higher than the projection the EIA made for 2015 in 2008.[9] Natural gas production in 2015 was about 40 percent higher than the EIA's 2008 projection. The comparative pessimism on the part of the EIA was largely due to not fully appreciating the impacts of smart drilling technology and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) at that time.

Without comprehensive seismic mapping and exploration, an accurate estimate of the recoverable natural resources that are currently locked up on federal lands and the continental shelf is unlikely. However, the combination of a rational regulatory environment with open access would likely put a 50 percent increase within reach.

Using a clone of the EIA's National Energy Modeling system, Heritage Foundation analysts looked at the impact of the High Resource Case on income and employment, as well as the impact on energy markets.

Heritage analysis shows that lifting needless and duplicative restrictions on energy production will increase employment by an average of 700,000 jobs through 2035. Along with the jobs comes $3.7 trillion in additional gross domestic product (GDP) that translates to an additional $40,000 of income per family of four by 2035.

Abundant Energy Reserves on U.S. Soil

Many believe that America has only a small fraction of the world's oil resources and that supplies will soon be exhausted. In fact, America has an abundance of energy resources. Though not all reserves are recoverable with today's technology, recent estimates project that the United States has over five times as much oil as Saudi Arabia. In fact, when American, Canadian, and Mexican reserves are combined, North American oil reserves total nearly 1.8 trillion barrels of recoverable oil.

To put this figure in perspective, the single continent of North America currently has more recoverable oil than the entire world has used since Edwin Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1800s. Much of the oil in the United States is concentrated in the Bakken Formation in Montana and North Dakota, but also occurs in many other areas of the country including Alaska, California, Oklahoma, and Texas. The resources in North America could continue to meet current energy demands across the country for well over the next 200 years.

These estimates are also always in flux. For example, in 1980, the United States was thought to have roughly 30 billion barrels of oil reserves. Over the subsequent 30 years, the U.S. produced nearly 80 billion barrels.[10]

Much of this oil, known as tight oil or shale oil had not been accessible with conventional extraction techniques. Improvements in technologies, primarily horizontal drilling and fracking, now enable producers to extract the oil and gas from these tight formations.

Furthermore, technological advancements have significantly increased the amount of recoverable natural gas in the United States. The estimated 2,200 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas in the U.S. is equivalent to 84 years of consumption at current rates.[11]

Companies have safely used such processes for decades in the U.S. to extract oil and gas from hundreds of wells across the country. In fact, the technology has improved so dramatically that companies are re-fracking wells to extract even more oil and gas from previously drilled wells.

The Economic Effects of Freeing Up America's Resources

Fracking and horizontal drilling have been critically important technologies in the extraction of the vast amount of recoverable oil and gas in various parts of the country and the revitalization of America's energy sector.[12] Drilling and extraction create jobs, but there are often tremendous job opportunities for engineers, geologists, mathematicians, truck drivers, welders, and others as well. There are also increased needs for associated manufacturing as well as demand for repair shops, menders, hardware stores, restaurants, hotels, and laundromats among many others. Natural gas and butane, ethane, and propane removed from natural gas provide feedstock for fertilizers, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The shale gas boom resulted in more than $100 billion in new chemical manufacturing investment.[13]

Unfortunately, however, anti-energy politicians and government bureaucrats have instituted a variety of policies and regulations that have rendered at least 60 percent of recoverable oil inaccessible.[14] Many of these regulations are based on concerns regarding the safety and potential contamination of water. However, a multi-year study recently conducted by the EPA found that fracking has not significantly or systemically impacted drinking water.[15] Proper enforcement of property rights, in conjunction with appropriate regulations implemented by state and local governments, not only enable the extraction of potentially valuable resources, but also have remarkable ability to protect the environment.[16]

We used the Heritage Energy Model (HEM), a clone of the EIA's National Energy Model (NEM), to quantify the impact of freeing up the energy markets by lifting the crude export ban as well as increasing the availability of domestic petroleum and natural gas. The HEM was used to compare current policy (the reference case) to a policy with broader access to energy resources (the alternative case). To model the impact of lifting burdensome regulations on the oil and gas industry, several assumptions were changed. Under this policy alternative, recoverable shale oil and shale gas and their variants are 50 percent higher, and well spacing is 50 percent lower than the reference case. There are a few less impactful assumptions, which are discussed in the appendix.

These results are quite striking. By 2035, the economy would experience an average positive employment differential of over 700,000 jobs with a peak employment differential of 1.5 million jobs. Chart 2 illustrates the impact of lifting these regulations on overall employment, across the American economy.

Chart 3 shows some of the industries that would see significant job gains as a result of a federal pro-energy policy.

These percentage differentials are quite substantial with respect to the overall economy, which has an average differential of 0.5 percent annually between the baseline and alternative scenario. These results are not surprising, as certain components of the economy will benefit tremendously not only from the reduced energy prices but also from the increased demand as the quest for cheaper and more affordable energy continues.

Although manufacturing employment declines in certain years, that change is simply a result of the American free market at its best. As a market expands, new jobs replace old jobs and the economy grows. Chart 4 provides the impact on manufacturing employment.

These economic gains arise for a variety of reasons. First, there is an increase in job creation directly associated with producing shale oil and gas not otherwise under current policy. In addition, the resulting energy -- used all across the economy -- becomes less expensive. Cheaper energy lowers the cost of doing business, making American companies more competitive and enabling them to invest and expand.

Americans stand to benefit from the increased economic activity. Chart 5 depicts this growth in terms of personal income for a family of four. As Chart 5 illustrates, annual income rises by thousands of dollars per family as a result of improved energy policy. In particular, by 2035, the average American family would enjoy a total gain of more than $40,000 in personal income. In terms of aggregate GDP, these gains translate into almost $3.7 trillion of increased aggregate GDP through 2035.

Finally, there is a drop in household electricity expenditures. This decline is due to the more efficient and less expensive forms of energy dominating the market and becoming a commonplace form of electricity generation for American households. (See Chart 6.)

How Congress and the Next Administration Should Lead

The economic potential of unleashing America's energy resources is tremendous. To achieve these gains, Congress and the next Administration should:

Conclusion

Often taken for granted, energy is an integral component of human life all across the world. By tapping many of its uncovered resources, America has the potential to be the world's largest producer of energy. With the right policies in place, tapping this energy can help create a vibrant and prosperous economy for decades to come.

The analysis in this Backgrounder uses the Heritage Energy Model (HEM), a derivative of the National Energy Model System 2015 Full Release (NEMS).[18] NEMS is used by the EIA in the Department of Energy as well as by various nongovernmental organizations for a variety of purposes, including forecasting the effects of energy policy changes on a plethora of leading economic indicators. The methodologies, assumptions, conclusions, and opinions in this Backgrounder are entirely the work of statisticians and economists in the Center for Data Analysis (CDA) at The Heritage Foundation, and have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the developers of NEMS.

HEM is based on well-established economic theory as well as historical data, and contains a variety of modules that interact with each other for long-term forecasting. In particular, HEM focuses on the interactions among (1) the supply, conversion, and demand of energy in its various forms; (2) American energy and the overall American economy; (3) the American energy market and the world petroleum market; and (4) current production and consumption decisions as well as expectations about the future.[19] These 12 modules are:

HEM is identical to the EIA's NEMS with the exception of the Commercial Demand Module. The Commercial Demand Module makes projections regarding commercial floor-space data of pertinent commercial buildings. Other than HEM not having this module, HEM is identical to NEMS.

Overarching the 12 modules is the Integrating Module, which consistently cycles, iteratively executing and allowing these various modules to interact with each other. Unknown variables that are related, such as a component of a particular module, are grouped together, and a pertinent subsystem of equations and inequalities corresponding to each group is solved via a variety of commonly used numerical analytic techniques, using approximate values for the other unknowns. Once a group's values are computed, the next group is solved similarly, and the process iterates. Convergence checks are performed for each price and quantity statistic to determine whether subsequent changes in that particular statistic fall within a given tolerance. After all group values for the current cycle are determined, the next cycle begins.[21] HEM provides a number of diagnostic measures, based on differences between cycles, to indicate whether a stable solution has been achieved.

We used HEM to analyze the impact of making hydraulic fracturing more feasible by increasing the availability of petroleum in North America. In particular, we ran two of the same simulations that the EIA used in ""Effects of Removing Restrictions on U.S. Crude Oil Exports,"" in comparing the impact of lifting the export ban to the impact of lifting the export ban coupled with greater availability of shale oil, shale gas, and its variants in North America.[22]",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Kevin D.

If you go to a gasoline pump to fill up your car, you're likely to see 3 different types of fuel: Regular gasoline (87 octane), mid-grade (89 octane), and premium (92 or 93 octane). But what do these choices actually mean?

According to TikTok user Michael (@schoolhousecaulk), the answer might surprise you -- and deter you from buying mid-grade gasoline ever again.

""The button that says mid-grade gasoline at gas stations in the United States usually doesn't actually lead to a separate tank, which is kind of bamboozling me. It's just mixing regular fuel and premium fuel at a specific ratio,"" Michael explains in his video, which currently has over 183,000 views as of Saturday.

In Michael's telling, as leaded gasoline was being phased out in the 1970s due to EPA regulations, gas stations transitioned to offering three options: Regular unleaded, premium unleaded, and leaded gasoline. When leaded gasoline was completely phased out, gas stations began ""offering mid-grade fuel with a middle-of-the-road octane number.""

""So these gas stations were like, well, maybe car manufacturers will eventually start building cars for mid-grade fuel, but no car is built specifically for mid-grade fuel,"" Michael says. ""Some of them recommend it, but they can run on regular fuel. There's no car that is only running on mid-grade fuel.""

So is what Michael is saying true? According to Capital One Auto Navigator, yes it is.

""Only a handful of modern vehicles -- all from Stellantis brands -- call for 89-octane gas. Even then, it's not required, only recommended. Using 87-octane fuel in any of them won't harm the powertrain,"" the article reads. The article later notes that cars are unlikely to see performance improvements from using 89-octane gasoline, saying, ""Your Toyota RAV4 won't see a performance benefit from a tankful of mid-grade or premium.""

On that note, an article from Vox argues against using most premium gas products in the first place.

""...For the vast majority of cars on the market, it's simply not necessary to prevent knocking,"" writes author Joseph Stromberg about purchasing higher-grade gasoline.

""It's a two flavor soft serve machine with the twist option!"" joked a user.

""I love that my '04 keep liberty user manual specifically says to use the lowest grade,"" said another.

""Can confirm, my internship made the specific valve that mixed that fuel to make mid grade. Part is in Gilbarco pumps (Costco uses them),"" recounted a third.

In an email to the Daily Dot, Michael elaborated that having the ""mid-grade"" option at the gas pump is a good idea.

""It makes the practice of mixing premium and regular fuels more convenient for the few that need it,"" he said. ""Living in an economy of convenience, I see how this button has remained a staple at so many fuel pumps even if its presence is redundant.""

He said that from time to time, someone will try to convince him to use mid-grade fuel but ultimately ""researching how the octane rating works and taking time to check the fuel recommendation in the car manual ultimately saved me money.""

""For most people, mid-grade does nothing and that is good to know,"" he continued.",dailydot.com,news,The Daily Dot,Braden Bjella,0.07450980392156858,448902149,1,https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/03/different-Gas-Pumps.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg,

After touching multi-year highs in 2022, energy stocks pulled back significantly last year, due to a challenging macro backdrop.

But a resilient job market has helped oil prices move higher on a year-to-date basis. And more recently, crude futures (CLK24) rallied after an International Energy Agency (IEA) report indicated that oil markets are likely to face a supply deficit for the rest of 2024, due to the possibility of production cuts from OPEC+.

The IEA also raised its forecast for global crude oil demand in 2024 to 1.3 million bpd, up by 110,000 bpd compared to its earlier guidance, due to a stronger economic outlook and the Red Sea shipping crisis, which should boost oil demand.

For investors looking to gain exposure to a continued rise in oil prices, here are five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) you can buy right now.

1. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)

The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) offers exposure to the energy sector in the U.S., and includes some of the largest oil companies in the world. The ETF is a solid investment choice for investors looking to shift exposure to a sector that can deliver outsized gains when oil prices surge higher.

The Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) is a low-cost ETF with an expense ratio of 0.10%. Compared to XLE, the VDE fund holds four times the number of stocks, which further diversifies your portfolio.

With $8.6 billion in assets under management, the VDE ETF is a multi-cap fund. Like XLE, some of the fund's top holdings include Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Schlumberger, and EOG Resources, which account for 50% of the ETF. VDE yields 3.01%.

3. VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH)

The VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) tracks the largest 25 listed oil companies in the U.S., limiting your exposure in the process. However, around 25% of the fund is invested in foreign equities, and several companies are cross listed on international exchanges.

The SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) provides exposure to the exploration and production subsector of the domestic energy market. The XOP is an equal-weighted fund and is useful for investors who are interested in companies responsible for discovering and accessing new oil and gas deposits.

The Global X MLP Energy & Infrastructure Fund (MLPX) tracks an index of master limited partnerships (MLPs) and companies engaged in the energy infrastructure sector. According to regulations, MLPX can allocate up to 24% of its portfolio to MLPs, with the rest going to infrastructure companies.

With just over $1 billion in assets under management, the MLPX has an expense ratio of 0.45%. Its top five holdings include Williams Companies (WMB), ONEOK (OKE), Enbridge (ENB), TC Energy (TRP), and Cheniere Energy (LNG), which account for over 40% of the ETF.

The fund holds 26 stocks, and the top 10 constitute 66% of the ETF. MLPX offers a generous yield of 4.94%.

That goal is now in limbo,"Over the past 20 years, Victor Ramirez has worked in warehouse after warehouse across southern California. And in almost all of them, he's felt painful, unbearable, oppressive heat. A few years ago, he fainted on the job. When he came to, his coworkers had tried to clean off the floor to give him a place to rest.

""Sientes como si estás adentro de un horno,"" he says in Spanish -- ""You feel like you're inside an oven.""

Ramirez and thousands of other indoor workers across California have been pushing for years for the state to make rules that would protect them from heat, especially as climate change ramps up the intensity and frequency of dangerous heat. They thought they were on the cusp of success.

This week, California's Occupational Health and Safety Administration's standards board (Cal/OSHA) was set tovote on rules that would have granted indoor workers the right to water, breaks, and cool-down areas when workplace temperatures topped 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Employers would have to use fans, air conditioning, or other methods to cool spaces, and adjust work tasks to account for increased heat fatigue when temperatures or the heat index exceeds 87 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat index is a measure that incorporates temperature and humidity, and more closely resembles the true feeling of heat.

California would have become only the third state in the U.S. to create rules protecting indoor workers from heat.

But heat rules have been running into strong political headwinds in many parts of the country -- even in climate-focused California. Florida is in the process of banning cities or counties from creating their own rules to protect workers from heat. And Texas successfully blocked local heat rules statewide last year, after several cities created statutes.

Stephen Knight, the executive director of WorkSafe -- a worker-focused advocacy group -- described the move as an ""enormous blow"" to California Governor Gavin Newsom's focus on addressing climate change. ""It was a real missed opportunity to take action to provide support and assistance and protections to the most vulnerable workers,"" he said.

California's proposed rules have not escaped the fierce opposition seen in other states.

A 2016 state lawtold state agencies to create an indoor heat rule by 2019. That deadline sailed past as advocates, industry, and Cal/OSHA negotiated hard over the rules.

After seven years, the rules had received sign-off from all necessary parties -- or so the Cal/OSHA standards board thought. Then, the night before the planned final vote, board members were instructed by the state's Department of Finance to pull the vote from the agenda, board chair David Thomas said during Thursday's meeting.

Without an official vote, the rules aren't able to move forward -- and are at risk, because of procedural issues, of being eliminated completely.

""We got blindsided today,"" Thomas said.

Workers from many different heat-impacted industries shared their disappointment.

""You have failed us,"" Raquel Saldaña, a janitor from San Diego, said in Spanish. She described suffocating conditions working in the summer when the air conditioning was off.

The board, taken aback by the last-minute directive, made an unprecedented move: they took an unofficial vote on the rules. The symbolic vote passed unanimously.

""We have a responsibility to the workers of California,"" Thomas said. The worsening heat risks mean the time pressure is on. ""[We have to] make sure that our people, our workers this summer are not subject to the same conditions that they have been in the past,"" he said.

Workers like Ramirez say there's no time to waste getting rules implemented. ""Cada vez que viene el verano, me siento preocupado,"" he says in Spanish -- ""Every time summer comes, I get worried."" And this summer is approaching quickly.

Ramirez is incensed that the rules, which would give indoor workers breaks, access to cool spaces to recuperate, and cool water on hot days, are now in limbo.

California ""debería de dar la muestra al resto del país, para mostrarles que aquí se respetan las vidas humanas,"" he says in Spanish -- the state ""should be an example for the rest of the country, to show them that here they respect human life.""

Heat exposure for indoor and outdoor workers is a growing risk for injury and even death nationwide. But creating worker protections from heat has proven a political challenge in different parts of the country in recent years.

There are no federal rules protecting workers from heat. In their absence, cities, counties, and states are left to create their own, but few have taken on the challenge.

Only four states -- California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado -- have rules protecting outdoor workers, like people in agriculture or construction, when temperatures get dangerously hot -- in the 80's. Only two states -- Minnesota and Oregon -- protect indoor workers.

""That means workers in 45 states across this country have no legal protections, no legal rights to protections from heat exposure from their employers,"" says Kevin Riley, director of the Labor Occupational Safety and Health program at UCLA.

Efforts to implement protections elsewhere have run into strong political headwinds. Last year, after several Texas cities issued rules mandating shade and water breaks for construction workers, the Texas legislature created a law to block them. Florida is in the process of passing a similar law to prevent cities or counties from making their own heat-protection rules for workers.

Oregon only implemented its heat protections after the Pacific Northwest's blistering 2021 heatwave, which killed hundreds. ""The fact of the matter is, we waited for someone to die before we did this,"" said Jamie Pang, the environmental health program director at the Oregon Environmental Council. Oregon's rules cover both indoor and outdoor workers.

""The chaos in California is just the latest reminder of why we need federal heat protections, stat,"" says Juanita Constible, a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some industry leaders are concerned the rules aren't clear enough, and that they'll be difficult or impossible for some businesses to implement, says Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce. Buildings for shipping businesses, for instance, often have walls, which means they count as an indoor workplace. But they also have giant doors that often open to the outdoor heat, which makes heat management inside complicated.

Many businesses store things in shipping containers or outdoor sheds. The rules about those spaces ""are not clear and feasible as drafted and so they won't really help the businesses trying to implement them,"" says Moutrie.

Restaurants are also in a tough position. Kitchens are often hot spaces, and some businesses don't have space for a required cool-down area -- and it's difficult or impossible to change heat exposure if an employee is cooking over an open flame, for instance.

California was the first state to successfully implement heat protections for outdoor workers, which have been in place since 2005.

Since then, human-driven climate change has significantly worsened heat risks. Eight of the state's 10 hottest-ever years have occurred since then. A 2022 heat wave killed nearly 300 people. Hundreds die from heat exposure in the state every year.

Cal/OSHA received reports of more than 500 heat-related workplace injuries last year. But the true number is likely much higher, says R. Jisung Park, an environmental economist at the University of Pennsylvania. He led a 2021 study that looked at workers' compensation claims from 2001 to 2018 across California and compared the injury records with daily temperatures.

Injuries were 5 to 7 percent higher on days when temperatures were between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to cooler days. Overall, the analysis estimated that working in uncomfortably hot conditions led to an extra 20,000 worker injuries a year in the state.

""If you're working on a 95 degree day, for instance, we're talking about an elevation in same-day injury risk of upwards of 10% or more. In some industries, it could be many times that,"" says Park.

Heat impairs people's ability to think clearly, and can make them clumsy or dizzy. That means all kinds of injuries can increase on hot days, not just obviously heat-influenced ones like fainting. ""Things like someone falling off of a ladder, someone getting hit by a moving crane, someone getting their hand caught in a piece of equipment,"" says Park -- similar to problems many workers described at the Cal/OSHA meeting this week.

Summer is coming, warned Knight. And with it will come increased risk.

""The people who made that decision [to cancel the vote] don't have to look in the face of the workers,"" says Knight, of WorkSafe, whose ""own bodies are paying the price for this kind of gamesmanship.""

The world's second largest producer, after China, also surpassed FY23's coal and lignite production of 937.22 million tonnes (mt) -- twenty-five days in advance.

Terming it as a ""historical high"", Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said the achievement of 1 billion tonnes in coal and lignite production will ensure that lights are on in citizens' houses even as the coal sector continues to power up the economy.

""Mission 1 billion tonne was a milestone we had put in action a few years ago considering the burgeoning electricity requirements of our nation. This is a historic milestone in India's quest for energy security under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The achievement of 1 billion tonne in coal and lignite production will ensure the lights are on in citizens' houses even as the coal sector continues to power up the economy,"" he added.,

Increasing output

On March 6, India's coal production not just surged past the milestone 900 mt, but also surpassed the FY23 output of 893.19 mt -- twenty-seven days in advance. Besides, it also achieved the output of 700 mt, on February 6 -- 30 days in advance compared to last fiscal year.

The country's monthly coal production exceeded 100 mt for the first time in March 2023, totalling 107 mt. In January 2024, the monthly output hit 99.73 mt.

The Ministry's focus on increasing production, particularly from captive and commercial mines, is to meet the growing demand for coal from the power and industrial sectors. India's power demand is expected to grow at 6-7 per cent per annum and the dry fuel accounts for around 70 per cent of the electricity generated in the country.

International Energy Agency (IEA) in its December 2023 coal report said that demand in India, which accounted for 14 per cent of global demand, is expected to rise by 3.5 per cent annually till 2026 topping 1,397 mt. It estimates a moderate increase in coal for power generation of 69 mt to 2026, the total reaching 1,006 mt.

India becomes the driving force behind the upward pressure on global coal demand through to 2026, even if the global trend is decided in China, the agency noted.

Suffiient stocks

India currently boasts a substantial coal stockpile, with around 96 mt available with coal companies. Besides, domestic coal-based (DCB) thermal power plants (TPPs) maintain coal stocks of 46.25 mt as of March 20, 2024.

The coal stocks on March 21 at TPPs stood at 49.2 mt, which is sufficient for 21 days. The stocks at Coal India (CIL), on March 22, was 82.3 mt.

The Ministry has assured that it has made ample preparations to supply coal to power plants for the peak summer season.

Speaking to businessline on February 27, Coal Secretary Amrit Lal Meena said, ""As on February 25, the total stock is 127.30 mt. So, we have already crossed the closing stock of April 2023. If you look at the stocks at TPP end, last year (April 2023) was 34.57 mt, while this year it is 41.01 mt. So, this is a significant increase. About 30 per cent extra stock is likely to happen. This 127.30 mt will go up to somewhere around 150 mt. The stocks at TPP end will go up to 43-44 mt.""

Barely a year ago, the Austin, Texas, native had a day job and experimented with posting his music online on a whim. Fueled by the success of his debut, ""To Be Free,"" which amassed more than 18 million Spotify streams, and his breakout, ""Coal,"" Gossett can seemingly do no wrong at the moment. He is early in his No Better Time headlining tour, which this week included sold-out shows in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Chicago with support from Ole 60, another band in the midst of an unexpected rise into the stratosphere.

More from Rolling Stone

Now, Gossett -- who turned 25 earlier this month -- is working to build a catalog that matches his soaring popularity. His second EP, the four-song Songs in the Gravel, hits streaming platforms on Friday. The first single, ""Bitter Winds,"" has been out since February.

""I really wanted to make sure this EP was out as soon as possible with this spring tour so that the fans have more songs they can recognize and enjoy,"" Gossett tells Rolling Stone.

The EP, the songwriter's second after last fall's No Better Time, is written entirely by Gossett, who says he was inspired by his formative years playing songs around a campfire at his grandfather's house on Lake Buchanan, near Burnet, Texas.

""Growing up there, I fell in love with music as my family and I spent weekends and holidays sitting in the gravel around the campfire playing songs -- years before I ever even dreamed of a music career,"" he says. ""I wanted to let my audience into that world.""

Gossett chose a photo of one of those campfires as the cover of the EP.

The collection mixes storytelling and self-reflection, and Gossett delivers with authority in his voice. His vocals are classically raspy, but he has a range and confidence in his singing that slyly commands a listener's attention.

Gossett is also touring with a band after a year of performing solo. His Texas-based five-piece made its debut this month during South by Southwest at Rolling Stone's Future of Music Showcase, held at ACL Live at the Moody Theater -- It was Gossett's first time playing with a band.

When you would sit by the fire playing songs, what kind of music were you playing, and what was influencing you?

During Easter or Christmas, when the whole family is there, everybody sits around a campfire and starts passing around guitars. It's usually me, my brother and my cousin -- just kind of singing songs with everyone singing along. That's what inspired the song ""Bitter Winds,"" which is a personal reflection of how fast time is going. I even have a line in there where I say, ""My feet are buried in the gravel."" That's very real stuff to me. Having the title be Songs in the Gravel, and the cover art be from there, it's super special.

You're putting this EP out ahead of an anticipated headlining tour, as your fanbase is expanding by the day. What do you hope the spring and summer holds for your music?

I just hope we can keep doing this. I try not to get caught up too much in something like, ""Am I making music that's gonna go viral?"" How we started this thing was that I make music I really, really like, and that I really enjoy. I think that people can feel that, and in turn, they enjoy it, too. I want to keep touring, and I hope that people keep showing up and that they enjoy the shows. That's the goal.""

What's the backstory to ""Finally Stop Dreaming""? It's such an eerie song.

It was really written as part storytelling, part self-reflection. The point of it really is, whenever I stop dreaming, or whenever I stop chasing whatever I'm going for, I'm basically just ready to go. It's about dreaming until the very last second. And when I'm done dreaming, I'll go without screaming and remember all the good times. It's a really good reflection, for me, on where I am in my life right now, and how things are moving for us. Plus, my wife is with me every step of the way, and that's helping fuel the fire for me.

That goal is now in limbo,"Over the past 20 years, Victor Ramirez has worked in warehouse after warehouse across southern California. And in almost all of them, he's felt painful, unbearable, oppressive heat. A few years ago, he fainted on the job. When he came to, his coworkers had tried to clean off the floor to give him a place to rest.

""Sientes como si estás adentro de un horno,"" he says in Spanish -- ""You feel like you're inside an oven.""

Ramirez and thousands of other indoor workers across California have been pushing for years for the state to make rules that would protect them from heat, especially as climate change ramps up the intensity and frequency of dangerous heat. They thought they were on the cusp of success.

This week, California's Occupational Health and Safety Administration's standards board (Cal/OSHA) was set to vote on rules that would have granted indoor workers the right to water, breaks, and cool-down areas when workplace temperatures topped 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Employers would have to use fans, air conditioning, or other methods to cool spaces, and adjust work tasks to account for increased heat fatigue when temperatures or the heat index exceeds 87 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat index is a measure that incorporates temperature and humidity, and more closely resembles the true feeling of heat.

California would have become only the third state in the U.S. to create rules protecting indoor workers from heat.

But heat rules have been running into strong political headwinds in many parts of the country -- even in climate-focused California. Florida is in the process of banning cities or counties from creating their own rules to protect workers from heat. And Texas successfully blocked local heat rules statewide last year, after several cities created statutes.

Stephen Knight, the executive director of WorkSafe -- a worker-focused advocacy group -- described the move as an ""enormous blow"" to California Governor Gavin Newsom's focus on addressing climate change. ""It was a real missed opportunity to take action to provide support and assistance and protections to the most vulnerable workers,"" he said.

Complications delay the heat rules

California's proposed rules have not escaped the fierce opposition seen in other states.

A 2016 state law told state agencies to create an indoor heat rule by 2019. That deadline sailed past as advocates, industry, and Cal/OSHA negotiated hard over the rules.

After seven years, the rules had received sign-off from all necessary parties -- or so the Cal/OSHA standards board thought. Then, the night before the planned final vote, board members were instructed by the state's Department of Finance to pull the vote from the agenda, board chair David Thomas said during Thursday's meeting.

Without an official vote, the rules aren't able to move forward -- and are at risk, because of procedural issues, of being eliminated completely.

""We got blindsided today,"" Thomas said.

Workers from many different heat-impacted industries shared their disappointment.

""You have failed us,"" Raquel Saldaña, a janitor from San Diego, said in Spanish. She described suffocating conditions working in the summer when the air conditioning was off.

The board, taken aback by the last-minute directive, made an unprecedented move: they took an unofficial vote on the rules. The symbolic vote passed unanimously.

""We have a responsibility to the workers of California,"" Thomas said. The worsening heat risks mean the time pressure is on. ""[We have to] make sure that our people, our workers this summer are not subject to the same conditions that they have been in the past,"" he said.

Workers like Ramirez say there's no time to waste getting rules implemented. ""Cada vez que viene el verano, me siento preocupado,"" he says in Spanish -- ""Every time summer comes, I get worried."" And this summer is approaching quickly.

Ramirez is incensed that the rules, which would give indoor workers breaks, access to cool spaces to recuperate, and cool water on hot days, are now in limbo.

California ""debería de dar la muestra al resto del país, para mostrarles que aquí se respetan las vidas humanas,"" he says in Spanish -- the state ""should be an example for the rest of the country, to show them that here they respect human life.""

A pattern bigger than California

Heat exposure for indoor and outdoor workers is a growing risk for injury and even death nationwide. But creating worker protections from heat has proven a political challenge in different parts of the country in recent years.

There are no federal rules protecting workers from heat. In their absence, cities, counties, and states are left to create their own, but few have taken on the challenge.

Only four states -- California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado -- have rules protecting outdoor workers, like people in agriculture or construction, when temperatures get dangerously hot -- in the 80's. Only two states -- Minnesota and Oregon -- protect indoor workers.

""That means workers in 45 states across this country have no legal protections, no legal rights to protections from heat exposure from their employers,"" says Kevin Riley, director of the Labor Occupational Safety and Health program at UCLA.

Efforts to implement protections elsewhere have run into strong political headwinds. Last year, after several Texas cities issued rules mandating shade and water breaks for construction workers, the Texas legislature created a law to block them. Florida is in the process of passing a similar law to prevent cities or counties from making their own heat-protection rules for workers.

Oregon only implemented its heat protections after the Pacific Northwest's blistering 2021 heatwave, which killed hundreds. ""The fact of the matter is, we waited for someone to die before we did this,"" said Jamie Pang, the environmental health program director at the Oregon Environmental Council. Oregon's rules cover both indoor and outdoor workers.

""The chaos in California is just the latest reminder of why we need federal heat protections, stat,"" says Juanita Constible, a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some industry leaders are concerned the rules aren't clear enough, and that they'll be difficult or impossible for some businesses to implement, says Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce. Buildings for shipping businesses, for instance, often have walls, which means they count as an indoor workplace. But they also have giant doors that often open to the outdoor heat, which makes heat management inside complicated.

Many businesses store things in shipping containers or outdoor sheds. The rules about those spaces ""are not clear and feasible as drafted and so they won't really help the businesses trying to implement them,"" says Moutrie.

Restaurants are also in a tough position. Kitchens are often hot spaces, and some businesses don't have space for a required cool-down area -- and it's difficult or impossible to change heat exposure if an employee is cooking over an open flame, for instance.

Climate change ratchets up risks

California was the first state to successfully implement heat protections for outdoor workers, which have been in place since 2005.

Since then, human-driven climate change has significantly worsened heat risks. Eight of the state's 10 hottest-ever years have occurred since then. A 2022 heat wave killed nearly 300 people. Hundreds die from heat exposure in the state every year.

Cal/OSHA received reports of more than 500 heat-related workplace injuries last year. But the true number is likely much higher, says R. Jisung Park, an environmental economist at the University of Pennsylvania. He led a 2021 study that looked at workers' compensation claims from 2001 to 2018 across California and compared the injury records with daily temperatures.

Injuries were 5 to 7 percent higher on days when temperatures were between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to cooler days. Overall, the analysis estimated that working in uncomfortably hot conditions led to an extra 20,000 worker injuries a year in the state.

""If you're working on a 95 degree day, for instance, we're talking about an elevation in same-day injury risk of upwards of 10% or more. In some industries, it could be many times that,"" says Park.

Heat impairs people's ability to think clearly, and can make them clumsy or dizzy. That means all kinds of injuries can increase on hot days, not just obviously heat-influenced ones like fainting. ""Things like someone falling off of a ladder, someone getting hit by a moving crane, someone getting their hand caught in a piece of equipment,"" says Park -- similar to problems many workers described at the Cal/OSHA meeting this week.

Summer is coming, warned Knight. And with it will come increased risk.

""The people who made that decision [to cancel the vote] don't have to look in the face of the workers,"" says Knight, of WorkSafe, whose ""own bodies are paying the price for this kind of gamesmanship.""

California workers hope it won't take someone dying to get protections approved.

""It's the mindset of most of the food operators that they can fool consumers by serving them unhygienic foods as quality of food will not be checked. The FDA will conduct a special drive during summer to check on ice and other food products which are of substandard or adulterated,"" said an official.

Maharashtra FDA Joint Commissioner (Food) Shailesh Adhao said the inspections were part of a summer drive. There are a lot of places that need to be checked continuously, he said, adding the department will collect food, ice and water samples for testing.

""Summer brings about a variety of illnesses with it. This happens because of contaminated water or food products consumed by consumers. We ensure that any substandard product found during inspection... we collect those samples for evaluating the quality of food and food ingredients used,"" he said.

Moreover, owing to the soaring temperatures in the city, demand for cold beverages and ice creams increase. ""For that reason we will start inspecting roadsides stalls, juice centres and ice cream parlours from next month,"" he said.

""We have given instructions to our food inspectors who will be checking or inspecting these stalls based on the list of quality criteria need to be checked,"" Adhao added.

Meanwhile, hawkers, juice centres, and eateries have been advised by the authority to keep a record of where they purchased their ice from.

Street-side stalls and joints mainly sell sherbets using various food colours and flavours; these places do brisk business.

Exxon has accused Chevron of trying to get around the right of first refusal provision by merging with Hess Corp -- a deal that would hand Chevron Hess's 30% stake. Chevron has argued that the right of first refusal doesn't apply to mergers.

Hess and Exxon -- and China's CNOOC, which has also moved to arbitrate the deal against Chevron -- have a joint operating agreement that dictates the terms for all consortium members.

Exxon said the dispute will make for an ""interesting arbitration"", but pointed out that since they wrote the provision themselves, they're pretty sure they know the intent behind it.

Exxon balked after Chevron announced it would merge with Hess, arguing that it was owed a chance to purchase its JV partner's mouthwatering stake in the Guyana deepwater oil block known as Stabroek. Exxon did say, however, that it was not interested in purchasing Hess as a whole -- just that it wanted to establish rights over Hess's assets in Guyana specifically.

Exxon currently operates and owns 45% of the block.

The arbitration case against Chevron could last as many as 6 months. ""We have built into that contract a remedy, which is to take it to an arbitration, so we're just going to exercise that remedy, and let an impartial panel decide who's right, whose interpretation is right. And so we'll just let that play out,"" Williams said.

""Every decision on this car we made hurts efficiency. Fratzonic: hurts efficiency. 305s, 325s [section width tires]: hurts efficiency. Sixteen-inch brakes: hurts efficiency,"" Kuniskis told the media.

The base electric Charger, the 496 hp (503 PS / 370 kW) Daytona R/T, has a range of 317 miles (510 km), which is pretty good for a car that weighs 5,838 lbs (2,650 kg), though not that great considering the capacity of the 100.5 kWh battery, whose size goes a long way towards explaining the curb weight. An entry-level Lucid Air has an 88 kWh battery and can do 410 miles (660 km) on one charge.

Related: The Dodge Charger EV Sacrifices Range For Muscle Car Performance

And it gets worse. Upgrade to the sporty Scat Pack, and you automatically downgrade your Charger Daytona's driving range to 260 miles (418 km). The two models use the same battery, but the Scat Pack makes 670 hp (679 PS / 500 kW) and comes equipped with range-sapping 20-inch wheels wrapped in fat rubber instead of the R/T's 18-inch hoops and skinnier tires.

And those aren't real world range numbers, remember. Owners are likely to see lower figures, especially if they use the performance at all. And let's say you never charge past 80 percent because you want to keep your battery in optimum health, and you never let it drop below 20 miles of remaining range because you don't want to run out. You could be looking at a practical working driving range of well under 200 miles (320 km) in the Scat Pack.

Which it turns out gives the Daytona Charger Scat Pack a strange kinship with the 1968-70 Charger it wants us to believe inspired it. The vintage Charger had a reasonably large 19-gallon (72 liters) gas tank, but Car & Driver's 426 Hemi road test car weighed 4,035 lbs (1,830 kg) according to the spec panel in its November '67 issue, and reportedly returned 9-12 mpg, giving a range of 171-228 miles (275-367 km). That compares with the EPA's 18 mpg rating for the now-dead 2023 Charger 392, which suggests a range of 333 miles (631 km) going by that car's 18.5-gallon tank capacity.

Oh, and in case you're wondering if the real 1969 Charger Daytona's aero nose extension helped matters at all, it didn't much. Road Test magazine covered 893 miles in a 440 wing car in December 1969, and achieved 11.3 mpg (which would equate to a 215-mile / 344 km range), though it's a sign of how much things have changed that the writers seemed quite impressed with that result.

So when it comes to range, the 1960s Charger and its modern electric namesake have plenty in common. But what a shame Dodge didn't give the new car a charging port that looked like the motorsport-style gas cap on the rear quarter of the old timer.",carscoops.com,news,Carscoops,Chris Chilton,0.0117647058823529,448901763,1,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Charger-range-v2.jpg,

The heat index is a measure that incorporates temperature and humidity, and more closely resembles the true feeling of heat.

California would have become only the third state in the U.S. to create rules protecting indoor workers from heat.

But heat rules have been running into strong political headwinds in many parts of the country -- even in climate-focused California. Florida is in the process of banning cities or counties from creating their own rules to protect workers from heat. And Texas successfully blocked local heat rules statewide last year, after several cities created statutes.

Stephen Knight, the executive director of WorkSafe -- a worker-focused advocacy group -- described the move as an ""enormous blow"" to California Governor Gavin Newsom's focus on addressing climate change. ""It was a real missed opportunity to take action to provide support and assistance and protections to the most vulnerable workers,"" he said.

California's proposed rules have not escaped the fierce opposition seen in other states.

A 2016 state law told state agencies to create an indoor heat rule by 2019. That deadline sailed past as advocates, industry, and Cal/OSHA negotiated hard over the rules.

After seven years, the rules had received sign-off from all necessary parties -- or so the Cal/OSHA standards board thought. Then, the night before the planned final vote, board members were instructed by the state's Department of Finance to pull the vote from the agenda, board chair David Thomas said during Thursday's meeting.

Without an official vote, the rules aren't able to move forward -- and are at risk, because of procedural issues, of being eliminated completely.

""We got blindsided today,"" Thomas said.

Workers from many different heat-impacted industries shared their disappointment.

""You have failed us,"" Raquel Saldaña, a janitor from San Diego, said in Spanish. She described suffocating conditions working in the summer when the air conditioning was off.

The board, taken aback by the last-minute directive, made an unprecedented move: they took an unofficial vote on the rules. The symbolic vote passed unanimously.

""We have a responsibility to the workers of California,"" Thomas said. The worsening heat risks mean the time pressure is on. ""[We have to] make sure that our people, our workers this summer are not subject to the same conditions that they have been in the past,"" he said.

Workers like Ramirez say there's no time to waste getting rules implemented. ""Cada vez que viene el verano, me siento preocupado,"" he says in Spanish -- ""Every time summer comes, I get worried."" And this summer is approaching quickly.

Ramirez is incensed that the rules, which would give indoor workers breaks, access to cool spaces to recuperate, and cool water on hot days, are now in limbo.

California ""debería de dar la muestra al resto del país, para mostrarles que aquí se respetan las vidas humanas,"" he says in Spanish -- the state ""should be an example for the rest of the country, to show them that here they respect human life.""

Heat exposure for indoor and outdoor workers is a growing risk for injury and even death nationwide. But creating worker protections from heat has proven a political challenge in different parts of the country in recent years.

There are no federal rules protecting workers from heat. In their absence, cities, counties, and states are left to create their own, but few have taken on the challenge.

Only four states -- California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado -- have rules protecting outdoor workers, like people in agriculture or construction, when temperatures get dangerously hot -- in the 80's. Only two states -- Minnesota and Oregon -- protect indoor workers.

""That means workers in 45 states across this country have no legal protections, no legal rights to protections from heat exposure from their employers,"" says Kevin Riley, director of the Labor Occupational Safety and Health program at UCLA.

Efforts to implement protections elsewhere have run into strong political headwinds. Last year, after several Texas cities issued rules mandating shade and water breaks for construction workers, the Texas legislature created a law to block them. Florida is in the process of passing a similar law to prevent cities or counties from making their own heat-protection rules for workers.

Oregon only implemented its heat protections after the Pacific Northwest's blistering 2021 heatwave, which killed hundreds. ""The fact of the matter is, we waited for someone to die before we did this,"" said Jamie Pang, the environmental health program director at the Oregon Environmental Council. Oregon's rules cover both indoor and outdoor workers.

""The chaos in California is just the latest reminder of why we need federal heat protections, stat,"" says Juanita Constible, a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some industry leaders are concerned the rules aren't clear enough, and that they'll be difficult or impossible for some businesses to implement, says Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce. Buildings for shipping businesses, for instance, often have walls, which means they count as an indoor workplace. But they also have giant doors that often open to the outdoor heat, which makes heat management inside complicated.

Many businesses store things in shipping containers or outdoor sheds. The rules about those spaces ""are not clear and feasible as drafted and so they won't really help the businesses trying to implement them,"" says Moutrie.

Restaurants are also in a tough position. Kitchens are often hot spaces, and some businesses don't have space for a required cool-down area -- and it's difficult or impossible to change heat exposure if an employee is cooking over an open flame, for instance.

California was the first state to successfully implement heat protections for outdoor workers, which have been in place since 2005.

Since then, human-driven climate change has significantly worsened heat risks. Eight of the state's 10 hottest-ever years have occurred since then. A 2022 heat wave killed nearly 300 people. Hundreds die from heat exposure in the state every year.

Cal/OSHA received reports of more than 500 heat-related workplace injuries last year. But the true number is likely much higher, says R. Jisung Park, an environmental economist at the University of Pennsylvania. He led a 2021 study that looked at workers' compensation claims from 2001 to 2018 across California and compared the injury records with daily temperatures.

Injuries were 5 to 7 percent higher on days when temperatures were between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to cooler days. Overall, the analysis estimated that working in uncomfortably hot conditions led to an extra 20,000 worker injuries a year in the state.

""If you're working on a 95 degree day, for instance, we're talking about an elevation in same-day injury risk of upwards of 10% or more. In some industries, it could be many times that,"" says Park.

Heat impairs people's ability to think clearly, and can make them clumsy or dizzy. That means all kinds of injuries can increase on hot days, not just obviously heat-influenced ones like fainting. ""Things like someone falling off of a ladder, someone getting hit by a moving crane, someone getting their hand caught in a piece of equipment,"" says Park -- similar to problems many workers described at the Cal/OSHA meeting this week.

Summer is coming, warned Knight. And with it will come increased risk.

""The people who made that decision [to cancel the vote] don't have to look in the face of the workers,"" says Knight, of WorkSafe, whose ""own bodies are paying the price for this kind of gamesmanship.""

California workers hope it won't take someone dying to get protections approved. To Yesenia Barerra, a former warehouse worker who now works for the Warehouse Workers Resource Center, an advocacy group pushing for the heat rules, the message is simple. ""Heat kills. Don't kill us,"" she said.",kpbs.org,news,KPBS,Alejandra Borunda,0.1529411764705881,448901740,1,https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/c5f9b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/911x512+0+85/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F22%2Fap38503204535-1--c7fb4451932e4676434030ceca8ea6f1c43e6a8c.jpg,eng-9416253

One of the characteristics that dogs and cats have that differentiate them from people is that they cannot regulate their body heat, as they do not have sweat glands, which is why they are prone to heat stroke.

For this reason, in the face of the dry season, it is vitally important to take the necessary precautions to prevent pets from suffering serious damage to their health.

Symptoms of heat stroke in pets include: excessive panting (in the case of dogs), redness of the gums, and drooling. In severe cases, both dogs and cats may experience vomiting, diarrhea, fainting and seizures.

Cats can try to relieve excess temperature by moistening their body by constantly licking their tongue.

Although all canines can be prone to getting sick when temperatures rise, there are some breeds that are more susceptible than others, such as those with short heads, such as bulldogs, pugs and terriers, as their tracheas are narrower and may have problems inhaling and exhaling air.

Others who can suffer more easily from high ambient temperatures are those who are overweight, are very young, or, on the contrary, are advanced in age.

Rabbits, like reptiles and birds, although less popular pets, can also be susceptible to damage from high temperatures.

Recommendations

To prevent pets from suffering heat stroke, specialists advise adapting walking routines, taking into account those hours when the sun is less incandescent (before 9 am and after 4 pm). Likewise, it is recommended to hydrate the animal and never leave it inside cars or in places without ventilation.

If it is birds, rabbits or reptiles, a recommendation to avoid heat stroke would be to introduce a bottle or closed bags of frozen water inside the cage, so that these can help lower the temperature of the place and help the animal. .",en.ultimasnoticias.com.ve,news,Últimas Noticias,Últimas Noticias,-0.1764705882352942,448901512,1,https://ultimasnoticias.com.ve/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Abridora-3.jpg,

At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85% of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd. has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

After the notification, Adnoc can now export oil stored in the Mangalore storage.

REVIEW - My wife stating, ""Honey, it's cold in here,"" combined with the review opportunity for Turbro's 12,000 BTU Wi-Fi enabled mini-split, ductless AC, and heat pump system, prompted a complete home theater makeover. How did it go? Read on, fellow Gadgeteers!

What is it?

The Turbro GL12K115 is a ductless air conditioner and heater split system with Wi-Fi, App and Cloud connectivity, and a wireless remote control.

[Me] ""Hey, The Gadgeteer has a review opportunity for a Turbro mini-split heater/air conditioner.""

[My wife] ""Yeah, but if we do that, we should probably paint. That system is so nice. It would be sad on such an old-looking wall. If we do that, the carpeting will look crappy, so we should replace it. The laundry room's bare floor is so cold. We could put some better-looking pieces of the old carpet in there, too!""

[Me] (Wincing) ""That means we'll need to empty both rooms. I guess I can do that. Oh crap, what have I gotten myself into?""

[My wife] ""Hey! We sent a new record! We haven't been to the hardware store in two whole days!""

It's a lot of work, but a room makeover changes the personality of the whole house. I love it, and thank Turbro for it! Here are before and after photos:

Last year, I reviewed the Turbro FMP05AC air conditioner. It's been instrumental in curbing the oppressive summer heat in my daughter's apartment, and we've both been happy with the design and performance. I was excited to have a look at their mini-split system.

It arrived in two large boxes with most of the pieces needed for a typical installation. You'll need the appropriate tools (level, measuring tape, screwdriver, drill, hole saw, scissors, voltage meter, adjustable wrenches, hex keys, pliers, torque wrench, and a vacuum set). If you aim to install the system yourself, Turbo's manual is commendable, but please use the utmost care. Mishandled electrical connections can kill you or burn down your house, and evacuated coolant is terrible for the environment.

Before starting this review, I did a boatload of research. The first question I asked was, ""Can I install this myself?"" Yes, but some notable tools and skills are required. Before jumping into it, I recommend reading and watching YouTube videos. Of course, professional installation is always an option.

The Turbro GL12K115 system has two primary parts: an indoor wall-mounted unit and a larger one (the compressor) for outdoor use. The coolant pipes, a communication cable, and a power supply wire need to pass through the wall. My raised ranch home has concrete walls requiring a beefy masonry drill. I found this to be the most challenging part of the installation. Turbro includes a cardboard template to ensure all the holes are in the correct places.

A slab or appropriate base under the compressor (not included) is required. Since the installation location is susceptible to collecting foliage, I purchased a wall bracket to enable a leaf blower to keep the area clean. No sense sucking debris into the compressor fan.

The outdoor unit needs power. The electric code requires a nearby electrical disconnect. I ran a dedicated circuit from the breaker in my home's electrical box to the fused disconnect. I used liquid-tight conduits to route electrical and control wiring to the compressor. These parts were not included.

To reduce condensation on the coolant lines, they are bundled with the drain and control cable and wrapped with insulation, which helps them pass through the wall during installation. Turbro included a wall sleeve and putty to seal the passage. For good measure, I also filled the cavity in the wall with spay foam insulation.

Condensation drain lines are in the box. Both the indoor and outdoor units need them. I added a tee to route a single hose away from the house and used brackets to keep them pretty.

With the electrical supply connected, the next step was to cut the refrigerant lines to the correct length. It's not difficult, but a pipe cutter and flange tool are needed to make the connections. The manual explains the process well.

Air that has entered the coolant lines can affect efficiency, so removal is required before the AC operates. I have a vacuum pump I use for servicing cars, but I need to purchase an adapter to fit it. The manual illustrates the process, and I had no trouble with it.

Not counting the tools, I spent about $300 on the parts and supplies to complete the installation. I estimate the job took about five hours.

Here is the Turbro GL12K115 outdoor unit securely mounted.

I added a bit of home-décor flair with a frame around it later.

The Turbro GL12K115 air conditioner operates with the remote control or the SmartLife app. The ""I Feel"" mode passes data information from a sensor in the remote for optimum temperature control nearest the user, and it was great for keeping my wife warm, toasty, and comfortable.

The app enables connectivity with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. It's delightful to walk in and say, ""Alexa, set the theater heater to 72 degrees."" A few minutes later, the room is toasty and warm. I also used the app to turn it off remotely to save energy.

The Turbro GL12K115 can automatically control the air conditioning and heating to maintain a specific temperature, fan only, or as a dehumidifier, which is particularly useful in preventing my basement from smelling musty during humid summer months. Additional settings exist to control the display, sounds, automatic evaporator cleaning, timers, and self-diagnosis. Lovely!

I was pleasantly shocked at the low sound levels for both the indoor and outdoor units. Both are remarkably quiet, even in ""Turbo"" mode. For perspective, my home's central forced-air system is a little louder. The GL12K115 was so discreet that I barely noticed when it cycled while watching a movie.

Moving horizontal and vertical louvers direct the steam of warm or cold air to the room area that needs it most or can automatically sweep. When the Turbro GL12K115 is off, they automatically close. Oooh! Cool!

Speaking of ""cool,"" we had a few hot days, so I was able to test the GL12K115's air conditioning capabilities. It does an excellent job of cooling and lowering the humidity. Bravo, Turbro!

What I like about the Turbro GL12K115

It's bewildering, amusing, and daunting how a single home improvement idea can snowball into a full-blown room makeover. What started as a two-day project idea evolved into a three-week home-improvement odyssey. Thanks to Turbro's GL12K115 Mini-Split heater/AC system, my wife and I can spend an evening enjoying the spoils of our labor and watching a movie in warm comfort. It's relatively easy to install (with the right skills and tools), looks great, and the performance is just what we needed to transform our home theater dungeon into a delightfully comfortable room where we don't want to escape.

That perhaps never was more evident than before the Miami Heat's game on Wednesday night at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

In the home-team interview room, Cleveland Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff was recalling a harrowing incident last season when a gambler got his phone number and began making threatening calls.

Down the hall, moments later in the visitor's interview room, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was relating a story of a gambler so intent on a desired outcome last season that the team had to have the spectator ejected.

Both conversations came in an arena that houses a Caesars-operated sportsbook.

For years, through partnerships and sponsorships, this has been the direction steered by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who in an op-ed piece a decade ago in the New York Times wrote, ""Sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight.""

The glare arguably never has been brighter, with the NBA this past week announcing that live betting would be coming to NBA League Pass -- watch while wagering.

That was among the reasons the topic was broached ahead of the Heat's victory over the Cavaliers.

It led to answers both unexpected and concerning.

""I do think it's somewhat contradictory,"" Spoelstra said of the NBA aggressively and emphatically moving into the gambling space. ""I think it treads on a weird line, for sure.""

That led to Spoelstra revealing the disquieting moment last season.

""We had an incident behind our bench last year with Vic Oladipo,"" Spoelstra said. ""Somebody was screaming. Security had to take him away. The game was already over, and evidently, he didn't shoot an open three at the end of the game. The game was already decided, and this fan was totally beside himself, and he was a gambler. He had money on whatever the score was.""

As with many teams, the Heat feature gambling signage on their court at Kaseya Center.

Then there was Bickerstaff's more profound perspective.

""They got my telephone number and were sending me crazy messages about where I live and my kids and all that stuff,"" Bickerstaff said, with the gambler later identified but no charges filed. ""It is a dangerous game and a fine line that we're walking for sure.""

While the NBA's newest feature with League Pass will be limited to point spreads, over-unders and moneyline odds at legal outlets in various jurisdictions, the reality is that a variety of apps offer real-time lines and constantly updated player propositions.

In other words, action all the time, even in blowouts, even in games involving teams that have no incentive to win.

""It brings added pressure,"" Bicklerstaff said. ""It brings a distraction to the game that can be difficult for players, coaches, referees, everybody that's involved in it. And I think that we really have to be careful with how close we let it get to the game and the security of the people who are involved in it.""

Even something rudimentary as the overall betting line, as Spoelstra noted with the Oladipo incident, can become intrusive, particularly where such bets are legal, where there is no need to remain surreptitious about having money on the line.

""The amount of times,"" Bickerstaff said, ""where I'm standing up there and we may have a 10-point lead and the spread is 11 and people are yelling at me to leave the guys in so that we can cover the spread, it's ridiculous.""

And yet it also is what Silver, the NBA and every other sports league are looking for -- action with enough juice to juice interest even when the outcome would otherwise stand irrelevant.

In every NBA locker room there is signage of hard-and-fast rules against gambling involvement by any member of a team. Such signage states that team representatives are prohibited from wagering on any NBA, WNBA, G League, NBA 2K League or Basketball Africa League game, tipping (specifically, nonpublic, proprietary or other sensitive NBA or team information, such as a player's injury status or his likelihood of playing in a game), as well, of course, as directly altering the outcome.

From there, players sit on benches with gambling advertisement at their feet.

This past week, that had Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton noting: ""To half the world, I'm just helping them make money on DraftKings or whatever . . . I'm the prop.""

A former Heat player who now is a coach said the slope is beyond slippery, the betting lines so public that it is difficult not to be aware that a late basket in an already-decided game could result in a payoff for the home fans.

""You still have to play the game without thinking about gambling,"" the coach said, with anonymity granted because of the sensitivity of the subject. ""I think you have to hold the ball. We do that for sportsmanship in the first place. I think you still have to be consistent with that. You can't go out of your way to make people money and things like that. I think that's where it becomes a little sketchy.""

Another former Heat player with European ties said it is an evolution in the NBA that already has taken hold elsewhere.

""It is an interesting topic,"" he said. ""And if I'm honest, it's hard to give an answer. Back in Europe, in those minor leagues, players bet on themselves, their own teams.""

This is where the NBA stands. No turning back.

""It changes the atmosphere,"" a former Heat player said. ""But it can't change the way you do things.""

But it can change and has changed the spectator/participant dynamic.

""There's just a lot of unintended consequences with that, from a security standpoint,"" Spoelstra said, ""that I'm not sure everybody totally understood when it became allowed.""

STRUS LOOSE: While former Heat forward Max Strus has been dealing with a knee injury, an ailment that kept him out of Wednesday night's game against the Heat at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, Sunday's visit by the Cleveland Cavaliers to Kaseya Center will be a reminder of what the Heat lost and the Cavaliers have gained. For Cleveland, when Strus merely is on the court it has been a win, ""Outside of his shooting numbers, his gravity is insane,"" Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell told Cleveland.com. ""It creates so much for everybody else. This is nothing against Miami, they don't have guys who are able to create the same way we are in ball-dominant ways. So, his role has changed. It's a little bit different here. He has adapted well. We know how much value he brings."" Strus exchanged jerseys with Heat forward Caleb Martin after Wednesday's game.

WAITING GAME: The most significant game remaining on the Heat's home schedule arguably is the April 4 visit by the Philadelphia 76ers, based on where the two teams stand in the Eastern Conference play-in race. Still uncertain is whether 76ers center Joel Embiid will be back from his knee injury by then. ""I think he kind of rounds into shape and rhythm pretty quickly,"" Philadelphia coach Nick Nurse said before the 76ers' victory this past week over the Heat. ""We want to get to the point where he's as healthy as he can be, come playoff or play-in time."" Nurse was then asked about referring to the play-in possibility. ""Well, we're in the play-in now,"" he said. ""I'm just opening my eyes and looking and seeing where we're at. It's reality. We're going to try to fight like heck to finish as high as we can.""

MOTIVATIONAL WORDS: Based on the fight the Pistons gave in their two losses to the Heat last weekend, Detroit coach Monty Williams just might be the right man for the job, even amid all the losses. ""I learned a tough principle a while ago about, 'Everything you want is on the other side of hard,' "" he said ahead of the second of those two losses to the Heat. ""Sometimes you avoid hard, or we want to get rescued from it. Most of the time, that's where the good stuff is if you can just stay with it and get on the other side.""

BACK AT IT: Former Heat captain Udonis Haslem again will be hosting his Hour Push Up Challenge to benefit Make-A-Wish Southern Florida and the Udonis Haslem Foundation. The event will be April 13 at Anatomy Miami Beach. The event, which seeks pledges for pushups completed in a one-hour timeframe, has raised over $715,000 in the last five years, featuring several participants from the Heat, including Spoelstra. Details can be found at https://sfla.rallyup.com/hourpushupchallenge24/Campaign/Details.

2nd. With their 21-16 road record, the Heat already have their second-highest total of road wins over the past decade, with four games left to match or better their 24-17 road record in 2021-22, which stands as their best road record since 29-12 in 2012-13 during the Big Three era with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.

A fire that broke out at the Kuibyshev oil refinery in Russia's Samara region overnight on March 23 had been caused by a drone attack, the regional government told Russian state-controlled news agency Interfax, citing Governor Dmitry Azarov.

In the past weeks, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia's oil industry. Ukraine has hit oil refineries in multiple regions deep inside Russian territory.

Drones attacked oil refineries in the Samara region at night, followed by a primary oil refining column at the Kuibyshev facility catching fire, said Azarov. There were no casualties, he added.

The fire was extinguished in the morning, the regional authorities told Interfax.

Researchers with the organization scored major fossil fuel companies on five metrics, including investment options, production plans, sanctions on recent products, incentives for remuneration and emissions reduction targets. In each category, the companies scored between 0 and 4, with 4 representing the closest alignment.

They assigned each company a grade of A through H, with A representing the closest to full alignment with Paris goals of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and H representing a strategy aligned with 2.4 degrees or more.

The report found the company most aligned with Paris goals was BP, which still received a grade of D-, while ConocoPhillips scored an H, the only company to receive the lowest grade. Of the five bottom scorers, three -- ConocoPhillips, Pioneer and ExxonMobil -- are based in the U.S.

Scores were particularly out of alignment with Paris when it came to emissions targets. None of the 25 companies scored a 4 on this metric, and only one, Italian oil company Eni, scored a 3. The majority of companies -- 16 -- scored a zero on emissions reductions.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris Agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" report author Maeve O'Connor said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies.""

The report comes months after the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where despite widespread criticism of an oil executive as head of the summit, attendees reached an agreement to begin the transition away from fossil fuels for the first time in the summit's history.",thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,,0.05882352941176472,448901099,1,,

The US had warned against such attacks due to potential oil price increases and Russian retaliation. Ukraine's drone strikes on have reduced Russia's oil processing by 10%, said UK military intel.

Ukraine attacked Russia's oil infrastructure after US officials advised them against targeting Russian oil refineries, Bloomberg reports.

Russia's oil infrastructure took another hit as drones targeted refineries in the Samara region.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery narrowly escaped damage, while the Kuibyshev refinery suffered a fire in one of its refining columns, Gov. Dmitry Azarov said.

The US has urged Ukraine to halt these attacks, according to The Financial Times, due to concerns over potential oil price increases and retaliation from Russia.

Responders managed to contain the blaze in Samara, averting a potential disaster at the facility, which boasts an annual oil processing capacity of 7 million tons, it was reported.

The targeted refineries, both part of Rosneft PJSC's Samara region group, play a crucial role in Russia's oil production landscape.

Footage distributed on social media claimed to show a Russian refinery ablaze in Samara last night. Business Insider was not able to verify its origins.

'Absolutely legitimate targets from a military point of view'

Ukraine's drone strikes on Russia's oil industry have inflicted significant damage, reducing processing capacity by 10%, said a

British defense intelligence update on Saturday.

""These strikes are imposing a financial cost on Russia, impacting the domestic fuel market. Depending on the extent of the damage, major repairs could take considerable time and expense. Sanctions are highly likely increasing the time and cost of sourcing replacement equipment,"" said the UK Ministry of Defence.

The strikes have targeted refineries, storage depots, and other key sites, exacerbating economic pain and raising fears of further escalation.

Another US concern at Ukraine's degrading of Russia's energy infrastructure, the FT said, is that Russia could retaliate by targeting energy infrastructure the West relies on, such as the CPC pipeline that transports oil from Kazakhstan to global markets.

According to Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna, officials in Kyiv believe that the refineries are ""absolutely legitimate targets from a military point of view.""

""We understand the calls of our American partners,"" she said. ""At the same time, we are fighting with the capabilities, resources, and practices that we have.""

It's not the first time the Biden administration has attempted to rein in Kyiv over its war strategy.

It previously warned Ukraine against using US-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.

Ukraine got around this ban by developing its own weapons that could strike inside Russia. Indeed, the refineries targeted in the Samara oblast last night are over 800 miles from Kyiv.

On Thursday, Russia retaliated against Ukraine's energy hubs, including the country's largest dam, with a wave of missiles and drones that left a million people without power.

Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Russia wanted to provoke ""a large-scale failure of the country's energy system,"" per BBC News.

Further east, an overnight drone attack on the Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery, the latest in a series of strikes against Russia's fuel industry.

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" he said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the facade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

In the Samara region - 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away from the front lines in the east - the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, governor Dmitry Azarov said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

The refinery, run by Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tonnes per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment,"" Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for over two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

That goal is now limbo,"Warehouse workers often labor in extremely hot conditions in California, as do many others who work indoors. The state has been considering new rules to protect them when temperatures soar to dangerous levels, but political headwinds have left the rules in limbo.

Over the past 20 years, Victor Ramirez has worked in warehouse after warehouse across southern California. And in almost all of them, he's felt painful, unbearable, oppressive heat. A few years ago, he fainted on the job. When he came to, his coworkers had tried to clean off the floor to give him a place to rest.

""Sientes como si estás adentro de un horno,"" he says in Spanish -- ""You feel like you're inside an oven.""

Ramirez and thousands of other indoor workers across California have been pushing for years for the state to make rules that would protect them from heat, especially as climate change ramps up the intensity and frequency of dangerous heat. They thought they were on the cusp of success.

This week, California's Occupational Health and Safety Administration's standards board (Cal/OSHA) was set to vote on rules that would have granted indoor workers the right to water, breaks, and cool-down areas when workplace temperatures topped 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Employers would have to use fans, air conditioning, or other methods to cool spaces, and adjust work tasks to account for increased heat fatigue when temperatures or the heat index exceeds 87 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat index is a measure that incorporates temperature and humidity, and more closely resembles the true feeling of heat.

California would have become only the third state in the U.S. to create rules protecting indoor workers from heat.

But heat rules have been running into strong political headwinds in many parts of the country -- even in climate-focused California. Florida is in the process of banning cities or counties from creating their own rules to protect workers from heat. And Texas successfully blocked local heat rules statewide last year, after several cities created statutes.

Stephen Knight, the executive director of WorkSafe -- a worker-focused advocacy group -- described the move as an ""enormous blow"" to California Governor Gavin Newsom's focus on addressing climate change. ""It was a real missed opportunity to take action to provide support and assistance and protections to the most vulnerable workers,"" he said.

Complications delay the heat rules

California's proposed rules have not escaped the fierce opposition seen in other states.

A 2016 state law told state agencies to create an indoor heat rule by 2019. That deadline sailed past as advocates, industry, and Cal/OSHA negotiated hard over the rules.

After seven years, the rules had received sign-off from all necessary parties -- or so the Cal/OSHA standards board thought. Then, the night before the planned final vote, board members were instructed by the state's Department of Finance to pull the vote from the agenda, board chair David Thomas said during Thursday's meeting.

Without an official vote, the rules aren't able to move forward -- and are at risk, because of procedural issues, of being eliminated completely.

""We got blindsided today,"" Thomas said.

Workers from many different heat-impacted industries shared their disappointment.

""You have failed us,"" Raquel Saldaña, a janitor from San Diego, said in Spanish. She described suffocating conditions working in the summer when the air conditioning was off.

The board, taken aback by the last-minute directive, made an unprecedented move: they took an unofficial vote on the rules. The symbolic vote passed unanimously.

""We have a responsibility to the workers of California,"" Thomas said. The worsening heat risks mean the time pressure is on. ""[We have to] make sure that our people, our workers this summer are not subject to the same conditions that they have been in the past,"" he said.

Workers like Ramirez say there's no time to waste getting rules implemented. ""Cada vez que viene el verano, me siento preocupado,"" he says in Spanish -- ""Every time summer comes, I get worried."" And this summer is approaching quickly.

Ramirez is incensed that the rules, which would give indoor workers breaks, access to cool spaces to recuperate, and cool water on hot days, are now in limbo.

California ""debería de dar la muestra al resto del país, para mostrarles que aquí se respetan las vidas humanas,"" he says in Spanish -- the state ""should be an example for the rest of the country, to show them that here they respect human life.""

A pattern bigger than California

Heat exposure for indoor and outdoor workers is a growing risk for injury and even death nationwide. But creating worker protections from heat has proven a political challenge in different parts of the country in recent years.

There are no federal rules protecting workers from heat. In their absence, cities, counties, and states are left to create their own, but few have taken on the challenge.

Only four states -- California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado -- have rules protecting outdoor workers, like people in agriculture or construction, when temperatures get dangerously hot -- in the 80's. Only two states -- Minnesota and Oregon -- protect indoor workers.

""That means workers in 45 states across this country have no legal protections, no legal rights to protections from heat exposure from their employers,"" says Kevin Riley, director of the Labor Occupational Safety and Health program at UCLA.

Efforts to implement protections elsewhere have run into strong political headwinds. Last year, after several Texas cities issued rules mandating shade and water breaks for construction workers, the Texas legislature created a law to block them. Florida is in the process of passing a similar law to prevent cities or counties from making their own heat-protection rules for workers.

Oregon only implemented its heat protections after the Pacific Northwest's blistering 2021 heatwave, which killed hundreds. ""The fact of the matter is, we waited for someone to die before we did this,"" said Jamie Pang, the environmental health program director at the Oregon Environmental Council. Oregon's rules cover both indoor and outdoor workers.

""The chaos in California is just the latest reminder of why we need federal heat protections, stat,"" says Juanita Constible, a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some industry leaders are concerned the rules aren't clear enough, and that they'll be difficult or impossible for some businesses to implement, says Rob Moutrie, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce. Buildings for shipping businesses, for instance, often have walls, which means they count as an indoor workplace. But they also have giant doors that often open to the outdoor heat, which makes heat management inside complicated.

Many businesses store things in shipping containers or outdoor sheds. The rules about those spaces ""are not clear and feasible as drafted and so they won't really help the businesses trying to implement them,"" says Moutrie.

Restaurants are also in a tough position. Kitchens are often hot spaces, and some businesses don't have space for a required cool-down area -- and it's difficult or impossible to change heat exposure if an employee is cooking over an open flame, for instance.

Climate change ratchets up risks

California was the first state to successfully implement heat protections for outdoor workers, which have been in place since 2005.

Since then, human-driven climate change has significantly worsened heat risks. Eight of the state's 10 hottest-ever years have occurred since then. A 2022 heat wave killed nearly 300 people. Hundreds die from heat exposure in the state every year.

Cal/OSHA received reports of more than 500 heat-related workplace injuries last year. But the true number is likely much higher, says R. Jisung Park, an environmental economist at the University of Pennsylvania. He led a 2021 study that looked at workers' compensation claims from 2001 to 2018 across California and compared the injury records with daily temperatures.

Injuries were 5 to 7 percent higher on days when temperatures were between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to cooler days. Overall, the analysis estimated that working in uncomfortably hot conditions led to an extra 20,000 worker injuries a year in the state.

""If you're working on a 95 degree day, for instance, we're talking about an elevation in same-day injury risk of upwards of 10% or more. In some industries, it could be many times that,"" says Park.

Heat impairs people's ability to think clearly, and can make them clumsy or dizzy. That means all kinds of injuries can increase on hot days, not just obviously heat-influenced ones like fainting. ""Things like someone falling off of a ladder, someone getting hit by a moving crane, someone getting their hand caught in a piece of equipment,"" says Park -- similar to problems many workers described at the Cal/OSHA meeting this week.

Summer is coming, warned Knight. And with it will come increased risk.

""The people who made that decision [to cancel the vote] don't have to look in the face of the workers,"" says Knight, of WorkSafe, whose ""own bodies are paying the price for this kind of gamesmanship.""

California workers hope it won't take someone dying to get protections approved. To Yesenia Barerra, a former warehouse worker who now works for the Warehouse Workers Resource Center, an advocacy group pushing for the heat rules, the message is simple. ""Heat kills. Don't kill us,"" she said.",npr.org,news,NPR,Alejandra Borunda,0.02745098039215677,448900713,1,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/03/20/gettyimages-1211310302_wide-4b4c4fc2401e0912e2ae0c5b04635b73fae75ee3-s1400-c100.jpg,eng-9416253

According to the statement issued by Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) last week, our current production is capped at 2.4 million barrels per day due to two voluntary reduction cuts totaling about 238,000 barrels in 2023 and 2024. Our three local refineries are operating at 1.4 million barrels per day, and an additional three refineries are currently operational in Oman, Vietnam , and Italy, with a combined capacity of about 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 barrels per day. Therefore, KPC's refining capacity stands at two million barrels per day.

Consequently, there isn't much net Kuwaiti crude oil remaining for global sale. This formidable challenge facing KPC makes it unlikely for us to make significant progress in discovering new oil reserves or increasing our production. One temporary solution may be to reduce refinery cuts, as we are currently doing with our latest Al-Zour refinery by cutting its throughput by 200,000 barrels to free up crude oil for sale. However, KPC did not provide details on the progress towards achieving its target of four million barrels, such as reaching three million barrels net of Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), excluding the Neutral Zone, for example. It also did not address whether we have halted the decline in crude oil production or how we are meeting the demands of our long-standing customers. It is disheartening to witness the decline in our primary source of income and the inability to increase our crude oil production. This raises recurring questions about our policy with OPEC+ regarding our commitment to reducing production at a time when Kuwait needs every barrel, as we are barely meeting our own foreign and domestic obligations.

Despite cutting our production once last year, we find ourselves compelled to reduce it again this year, resulting in the need to cut production at the Al-Zour refinery by 200,000 barrels per day to meet our crude oil sales obligations. Meanwhile, other OPEC+ members not only refuse to cut production but also exceed their established quotas, depriving us of additional funds while we face deficits in our budgets by the end of the financial year.

Predicting crude oil production for 2040 in 2024 is projecting too far ahead. KPC should have instead informed the USA about Kuwait's production for a nearer term such as for 2026- 2027 or even shorter periods. Or it should wait for about six years to achieve such a figure, considering the uncertainties regarding the fate of fossil fuels and the development of alternatives to oil, or after figuring out when KPC can achieve a production level of three million barrels without taking into consideration the production from the Neutral Zone.",arabtimesonline.com,news,ARAB TIMES - KUWAIT,,-0.207843137254902,448900368,1,https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/oil.jpeg,eng-9412709

OrilliaMatters welcomes letters to the editor at [email protected] or via the website. Please include your full name, daytime phone number and address (for verification of authorship, not publication). The following letter is in response to an article about a petition to rename Highway 400 in honour of Gordon Lightfoot, published March 18.

While I think the initiative to recognize Gordon Lightfoot's talent is great, let me explain why I won't be signing on to the highway petition.

I think testaments showing tribute to a masterful career are a lovely idea. But to be effective, they should link to the skills of the individual being honoured. Clearly, Gordon Lightfoot was not known as a highway driver. And Highway 400 does not even go near Orillia, Gord's birthplace.

Then, we have the 'old habits die hard' department: it's a truism that well-established highway names are not easily relinquished. A portion of Highway 401 between Trenton and Toronto has been designated the Highway of Heroes. Been that way for 17 years. But does anyone refer to this? Nope. It's ""the 401.""

Do motorists travelling along Highway 35 talk with glowing hearts about the 'Midland Regiment Commemorative Highway?' 'Fraid not.

County Road 93 is apparently the 'Sarah Burke Memorial Highway.' Who's she? Why, the champion freestyle skier from Barrie, who died from injuries sustained during a training accident back in 2012, of course. Oh, you didn't know that? Well, then, how about Angela Schmidt Foster Road? Hmm. I can't find anyone who knows of this highway as anything other than 'the extension of Highway 12' or who's aware that the Midland resident being honoured was an Olympic cross-country ski competitor.

I rest my case, and that's why my name will not be on the petition.

However, while I have nothing against the current designation 'Mariposa Folk Festival,' may I propose renaming this famous Orillia-based celebration the 'Gordon Lightfoot Festival?' Might just serve as an appropriate, lasting way to remember the amazing talents of an inspired singer-songwriter, and in his hometown, too.

Gavin Newsom and environmental advocates in Inglewood on Friday to launch a campaign to keep a 2022 law banning new oil and gas wells near homes, schools and hospitals.

The law bans new wells within 3,200 feet of certain community sites, and proponents say it will protect residents from the health impacts of pollution. It hasn't taken effect after the oil industry qualified a referendum to ask voters to overturn it in November.

At a Los Angeles park with an oil pump jack in the background behind him, Newsom said keeping the law is a key part of advancing the state's climate goals.

""Big Oil is the polluting heart of this climate crisis,"" Newsom said. ""Thank you for being here today, tomorrow, and thank you for being there on Election Day, when we send a powerful message - not just here in the state of California, but heard all across the United States.""

Newsom is backing a lawsuit claiming oil and gas companies deceived the public about the risks of fossil fuels. It's part of his efforts to fortify California's status as a climate leader as the state transitions away from fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks and trains.

The California Independent Petroleum Association, which is pushing for voters to overturn the law, is concerned about how it will impact the oil and gas industry, which generates large amounts of state and local tax revenue.

Newsom signed a law last year that was inspired in part by oil industry tactics, which have come under scrutiny, to collect enough signatures to get the referendum on the ballot. The law requires top funders pushing a referendum proposal to overturn a law to be listed on voter information guides released by the state. It also requires a referendum on the ballot to ask voters to ""keep the law"" or ""overturn the law,"" a departure from asking them to vote ""yes"" to keep the law or ""no"" to block it.

Lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would have made oil companies pay up to $1 million to people with cancer or other health problems associated with a well, but it was blocked by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Nalleli Cobo, an environmental activist who grew up near an oil well in Los Angeles, said she started experiencing nosebleeds, heart palpitations and headaches as a child and was diagnosed with reproductive cancer at age 19. She has since worked to fight against the health impacts of the oil industry and wants voters to keep the law limiting the location of new oil and gas wells.

While domestic gas demand has been lackluster, the automobile association said rising oil prices helped push pump prices higher, adding the Midwest may see a bit of a price reprieve, as the large BP Whiting refinery in Indiana is back up and running after being down since Feb. 1.

""Gas prices are a lot like seasonal temperatures. They start to rise with the arrival of spring, said Ryan Adcock, AAA spokesperson. ""And the national average for gas is now higher than a year ago, which we have not seen since late December.""

According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gas demand decreased slightly from 9.04 million barrels per day to 8.81 million last week. Meanwhile, total domestic gasoline stocks dropped by 3.3 million barrels to 230.8 million. While lower demand would typically contribute to pushing pump prices lower or slowing increases, AAA said rising oil prices have pushed them higher instead.

Thursday's national average of $3.52 is 25 cents more than a month ago and nine cents more than a year ago.

Locally, the gas price average for the Commonwealth increased to $3.39 -- 11 cents higher than a week ago and 17 cents higher than a month ago.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""",masslive.com,news,MassLive,Associated Press,-0.2235294117647059,448900076,1,https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/3IJFCXCWNVFP5COVIY3V27DQ7A.jpg?auth=b5055901ad7587d4baff1c1f9eb8d561d01b9348cdf530dd347ae748b578af3b&width=1280&quality=90,eng-9420239

Further east, in the Samara region - 620 miles away from the front lines in eastern Ukraine - the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a major fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, Dmitry Azarov, the governor of Samara, said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

Oil refineries 'legitimate targets'

Ukraine said on Friday that Russian oil refineries were legitimate targets, despite reports that the US has been warning it to halt drone strikes amid fears they could hinder Joe Biden's re-election chances.

There have been at least nine attacks on major Russian refineries this year, which have caused crude oil prices to jump in recent weeks.

The refinery, run by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tons per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Mr Azarov said.

'Retaliatory' attacks

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for more than two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

And Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital, Kyiv, in recent days.",telegraph.co.uk,news,The Telegraph,,-0.5058823529411764,448899971,1,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2024/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000371401868_17111911805060_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf_4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9419603

The Russian media reported on this.

As a result of the attack, a massive fire occurred on the territory of the refinery. Witnesses reported a large number of ambulances and fire trucks.

Drones hit the oil refinery at around 2 a.m. According to witnesses, the ABT-5 atmospheric and vacuum oil distillation system was attacked.

The governor of the region, Dmitry Azarov, said that all drones targeting the oil refinery had been intercepted. He did not specify why the fire started.

He also noted that the fire had occurred at the primary oil processing column. There were no casualties or injuries among the refinery's employees.

In addition, he said that no damage nor loss had been caused to the process equipment.

The Kuibyshev oil refinery specializes in the production of lubricants, gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as several dozen other oil products in demand on the market.

It should be noted that a few weeks ago, drones struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery and the Syzran oil refinery in Russia.

The attack started a fire on an area of 500 square meters. The fire at the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery was extinguished in half an hour.

As previously reported, Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, Commander of U.S. Forces Europe in 2014-17, noted that attacks on Russian refineries should've been continued.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Source: UK Defence Intelligence review dated 23 March on Twitter, as reported by European Pravda

Details: After the Russian government announced plans to deploy Pantsir air defence systems to protect oil refineries, the UK intelligence noted it is unlikely that Russia will be able to protect all vulnerable facilities, given the size and scale of its energy industry.

""Recent strikes against refineries have likely disrupted at least 10 per cent of Russia's refining capacity,"" the UK MoD stressed.

Analysts suggested that significant repairs at Russian refineries might require substantial time and expense, depending on the extent of the damage, with sanctions likely to add to the time and cost of sourcing new equipment.

The UK MoD noted that some of the most remote facilities in Russia that have been attacked are about 900 kilometres from Ukraine, demonstrating the reach of Ukraine's drone attacks.

""These strikes are imposing a financial cost on Russia, impacting the domestic fuel market,"" the UK intelligence summarised.

With weather extremes becoming increasingly common, food producers are being encouraged to store water during the wet winters to safeguard against possible summer droughts.

Andrew Spinks, an agricultural business consultant in the Norwich office of Brown&Co, said the government has announced another round of water management grants will be opened some time later this year - although the exact date is not yet known.

It is expected to fund 40pc of the cost of pipes, pumps and reservoirs, he added.

""My challenge with these schemes is always getting the planning and the irrigation licences in place to be able coincide with the grant,"" he said.

""It is worth anyone considering a project spending some time now and giving it some proper thought ahead of any grant window.

""A reservoir viewed from the point of view of return on investment is very long term, however as we see changes to water licencing over the next few years - which could mean that some farms lose their ability to irrigate - those without a reservoir could find themselves without water and really exposed to the vagaries of the changing climate.""

Mr Spinks said he shared the frustrations of farmers who were not able to abstract flood waters this winter to store for use during dry summers - a concern which was put to Defra minister Mark Spencer at February's Norfolk Farming Conference.

Earlier this month, the Environment Agency (EA) released a Regulatory Position Statement, enabling existing abstraction licence holders to store flood waters for irrigation, outside the dates usually specified by their licences, when official flood alerts are in place.

This is subject to conditions including that abstractors must not ""adversely affect or damage designated conservation sites"".

George Gay, of Mautby Farms near Great Yarmouth, said conditions like this have prevented him from accessing irrigation water in the environmentally-sensitive Norfolk Broads - so he would not be able to make use of the new reservoir grants.

""It is very frustrating,"" he said. ""We have not got irrigation at the moment, but we are trying to future-proof ourselves so we have applied a couple of times to get an abstraction licence, but our problem is we are next to Fleggburgh Common, which is a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest).

""Even if there is excess water in the system it is not easy to get permission to take it out.""

Mr Spinks added that other available grant sources include the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund, Countryside Stewardship capital grants, and autonomous and robotic machinery grants which are generating a lot of interest from vegetable growers.

Meanwhile, he said options funded under the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) could also help manage water, improve soil and contribute to alleviating the impact of excess rainfall.",edp24.co.uk,news,Eastern Daily Press,Chris Hill,0.3411764705882352,448898698,1,https://www.edp24.co.uk/resources/images/17875824/,

Gavin Newsom's administration unexpectedly yanked its support from a sweeping proposal that would have protected millions of California's indoor workers from dangerous heat, saying it can't endorse it without knowing the projected costs to the state.

But the board that oversees worker safety immediately defied the administration Thursday by unanimously approving new standards intended to protect people who work in poorly ventilated warehouses, steamy restaurant kitchens, and other indoor job sites.

The showdown represents a setback to the state's climate and labor policy goals, and throws the fate of the rules into unknown territory. They had been expected to take effect by summer.

The move by the Democratic administration angered board members, who called it a ""last-minute stunt"" that undermines their regulatory process. It also sparked a protest by warehouse workers, who temporarily shut down the meeting as they waved signs declaring that ""Heat Kills!"" and loudly chanted, ""What do we want? Heat protection! When do we want it? Now!""

""We got blindsided today, and I don't think it was fair,"" said David Thomas, chair of the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board, who became visibly upset several times during the meeting. ""They hung our ass out to dry.""

The rules to protect indoor workers had been years in the making, but Newsom's Department of Finance informed board staffers the night before the vote that it couldn't sign off. They told us ""the potential fiscal impacts on public sector entities haven't been fully analyzed,"" Eric Berg, deputy chief of health and research and standards at California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, reported to the board.

Newsom spokesperson Omar Rodriguez declined to comment. But Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer disputed the characterization of the administration's concerns as ""last-minute."" He said the administration has held meetings with board staffers for weeks to discuss estimates for how much it would cost the state to implement the rules in its own buildings. They provided the most recent estimates to Palmer's department in February.

By law, the Department of Finance is required to approve a fiscal review for any regulation that would have significant economic impacts.

For example, the indoor heat standard proposal could cost the state billions of dollars just to keep its prisons cool enough for workers and inmates, Palmer said, based on the board's estimate.

""We need to evaluate that. Is it too high? Is it on point?"" he said. ""This is not a decision made in an arbitrary manner or concerning policy. We did not have the time to do due diligence.""

Palmer would not comment on how much longer it would take to analyze the cost of the rule.

The deadline to keep the proposal on track is March 30. Otherwise the years-long regulatory process may have to start from scratch. But this is unknown territory, and board members said at the March 21 meeting they are not sure how to proceed. Some suggested they could adopt emergency regulations -- but even that would take time.

The state has had heat standards on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, and indoor workplaces were supposed to be next. The proposed standard would require work sites to be cooled below 87 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present and below 82 degrees in places where workers wear protective clothing or are exposed to radiant heat, such as furnaces. Buildings could be cooled with air conditioning, fans, misters, and other methods.

For businesses that couldn't cool their workplaces sufficiently, such as laundries or restaurant kitchens, where commercial boilers, ovens, and fryers operate, the rule would offer them the option of giving workers cooldown areas and other relief.

Some businesses have expressed fear that they won't be able to meet the requirements if they are enacted, even with the flexibility the regulation offers. Providing a place for a kitchen worker to cool down in a small restaurant, for example, might not be feasible, according to the California Restaurant Association.

But workers and labor advocates demanded at the March 21 meeting that the board take action, saying employers must protect workers and adapt to a warming climate.

""How many workers have to end up hospitalized or, even worse, end up dying because of heat illness, because there's no protections put in place?"" Yesenia Barrera, an organizer with the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, asked board members.

Heat stress can lead to heat exhaustion, heatstroke, cardiac arrest, and kidney failure. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,600 heat-related deaths, which is likely an undercount because health care providers are not required to report them. It's not clear how many of these deaths are related to work, either indoors or outdoors.

In California, 20 workers died from heat between 2010 and 2017, seven of them because of indoor heat, according to the Rand Corp., which analyzed the state's proposed indoor heat rules.

Only two other states, Minnesota and Oregon, have adopted heat rules for indoor workers, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Nationally, legislation has stalled in Congress, and even though the Biden administration has initiated the long process of establishing national heat standards for outdoor and indoor work, the rules are likely to take years to finalize.

California regulators have crafted the indoor rules to complement the state's protections for outdoor workers. Those say that when temperatures exceed 80 degrees, employers must provide shade and observe workers for signs of heat illness. At or above 95 degrees, they must come up with ways to prevent heat illness, such as reducing work hours or providing additional breaks. Colorado, Oregon, and Washington also have rules for outdoor workers.",record-bee.com,news,Lake County Record-Bee,Samantha Young,-0.0117647058823529,448898685,1,https://www.record-bee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/LRB-Filler-PhotoCORRECT-SIZE.png,

Tanzania has seized a momentous opportunity in the Kenya-Uganda stalemate over oil importation with a raft of offers that Kampala cannot refuse.

The EastAfrican understands that President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government has offered to register Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) to use the Dar es Salaam port in the importation of fuel for Uganda as Kenya sticks to its guns on Uganda's demands.

Meanwhile, a case that Kampala lodged at the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) awaits determination, with no set timelines although various sources have indicated a willingness by Uganda to withdraw it, on which Kenya is banking.

Presidents William Ruto, Yoweri Museveni and Samia recently converged in Zanzibar -- rare tripartite meeting reportedly requested by Uganda, people close to the discussions say, to seek assurance of Uganda's smooth importation of petroleum and other products.

And while Kenya offers Uganda a pass through the Northern Corridor, it seems to insist on local regulatory processes, saying they are legal under Kenyan law. Nairobi is also opposed to Uganda's decision to take the matter to the regional court.

Uganda sued Kenya in December last year at the East African Court of Justice, protesting Nairobi's refusal to license Unoc to directly import fuel for Uganda as it sought a departure from the expensive private oil cartels. The Kenyan regulator, Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra), had been barred from licensing Unoc after oil marketers went to local courts to block the move.

According to sources Tanzania has registered Unoc and waived a number of local requirements to enable the company import oil. Some of those conditions include exemption of work permits, waivers on some taxes, free yards at the port, allowing Uganda to directly manage the company's processes and reducing road blocks.

This week, some oil companies confirmed they had received supplies from the Unoc.

If Unoc finds it easier importing via Tanzania, it means Uganda could look away from Kenya in a significant shift, and hurt Kenya's revenues. Kampala has imported most of its oil via the port of Mombasa, with 90 percent of that picked up through the Kenya Pipeline depots in western Kenya.

This week, Kenya said it was negotiating with Kampala to resolve the dispute over the fuel imports in spite of the case before the EACJ.

Trade Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano said discussions are underway to resolve the dispute.

""There are discussions that are likely to resolve the matter that is before court,"" Ms Miano told The EastAfrican.

Uganda, meanwhile, admits that Tanzania has lobbied massively, targeting to convince Kampala to reroute all its oil business, and other import trade via Dar.

""The government of Tanzania has been very supportive and we are moving very fast in terms of getting access routes through the port of Dar,"" Rose Nakabirwa, Uganda's Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources told The EastAfrican.

But she was quick to clarify that Uganda won't put all its eggs in one basket.

""We will still push to have access to the port of Mombasa because we have a right to be given access under the United Nations conventions. It is a shame to the diplomatic relations that we have had to go to court,"" the minister said.

After the Zanzibar meeting on March 14, two things emerged, according to sources who spoke to The EastAfrican. While the three leaders see the need to end squabbling, they also see the utility of the political tool in their local rules. For Uganda, the competition between Kenya and Tanzania offers a bargaining chip.

Tanzania sees the tiff with Kenya as an opportunity to get a customer while Kenya has chosen to wait out for Uganda to tire.

""Tanzania's entry in the tiff is frustrating because they want to offer their deal on the cheap. Kenya, on the other hand, has given Uganda what it offered before: Unoc has to apply and follow the relevant procedure,"" a Kenyan official familiar with the talks told The EastAfrican.

Kenya says it can waive some of those requirements but does not want Uganda to question the regulatory processes. As such, the official indicated Kenya is willing to grant Unoc those waivers if Uganda formally withdraws the case at the EACJ.

""Kenya's view is that these regulatory processes are not meant to hinder Uganda from accessing petroleum products but they are meant to instil transparency and accountability in dealing with petroleum products. This is consistent with Kenya's Constitution,"" the source indicated.

Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are the founding members of the East African Community and the March 14 meeting was meant to demonstrate willingness to talk out disputes. It also marked the anniversary of the day, in 1996, when leaders from the three countries re-assembled in Arusha to re-establish the EAC, which had collapsed in 1977.

It was Ruto's second time this year meeting with Museveni after the falling-out over oil importation and other trade disputes. Kenya roped in former prime minister Raila Odinga as some kind of ""special envoy"" to help broker negotiations. Raila's achievement, officials say, was the re-establishment of the communication channels between Nairobi and Kampala, which had broken.

But it hasn't ended the dispute yet, because officials also admit that there some senior political figures in Kenya keen to protect their stranglehold on the oil export business to Uganda. In turn, Uganda has chosen to bank on the protection of the East African Community legal regime.

In EACJ, however, Kenya has stuck to its guns, declaring the Ugandan case a waste of the court's time. In a response filed by the Attorney-General, Nairobi said Uganda had, in fact, agreed to the regulatory processes demanded by Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) and ""cannot turn around and question their legal standing.""

""The Republic of Kenya, through its stated organs, and in good faith, sought to waive aspects of the Regulatory requirements, which intention, was, however, stayed by the High Court, an independent organ of the Republic of Kenya not subject to control or direction by any person or authority,"" the Kenyan Attorney General said in filings on February 28.

Kenya says Uganda should have waited for the case in the Kenyan court to be determined before declaring that Nairobi had refused to provide Unoc with the licence. In fact, it argues that the EACJ cannot hear an appeal on issues guided and decided by Kenyan courts on local laws.

Kenya, through the Ministry of Energy and the Epra issued a raft of requirements that Unoc needed to comply with in order to get the licence.

Uganda claimed that Kenya had reneged on an earlier commitment, made in April 2023, to support Kampala's quest to directly import its fuel starting January 2024.

""The actions of the Kenyan judiciary in issuing the conservatory orders restraining, among others, Epra from issuing the licence to Uganda contravenes the EAC Treaty,"" said Uganda's Attorney General in the suit at EACJ.

Uganda wants Kenya compelled to licence Unoc.

Kenya's response to the EACJ, however, came a day late indicating that Kenya had hoped for a solution out of court.",thecitizen.co.tz,news,The Citizen,,0.3725490196078431,448898682,1,https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/resource/image/4202052/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/2757d05682df3711d20def677b1d8de6/Ac/dar-port.jpg,eng-9419874

Gas prices rose this week across Arizona and the nation amid higher oil prices and a drop in fuel supplies, AAA says.

The statewide average gas price increased about a dime in a week to $3.74 per gallon of regular on Friday, while the national average rose more than 9 cents to $3.53 per gallon.

Tucson's average gas price edged up 4 cents to $3.67 per gallon.

Yuma had the state's lowest average gas price at $3.50 per gallon, while Scottsdale had the state's priciest gas at an average of $3.90 per gallon.

AAA said higher oil prices combined with the normal spring gas price increases tied to a switchover to summer blends have driven pump prices higher in recent weeks.

Multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in Russia killed two people and set fire to another major oil refinery, despite US warnings to stop targeting such sites.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod, wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region, which borders Ukraine, as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Mr Gladkov said.

Two people had been killed and at least seven injured, the governor said.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" he said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the façade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

Further east, in the Samara region - 620 miles away from the front lines in eastern Ukraine - the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a major fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, Dmitry Azarov, the governor of Samara, said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

Oil refineries 'legitimate targets'

Ukraine said on Friday that Russian oil refineries were legitimate targets, despite reports that the US has been warning it to halt drone strikes amid fears they could hinder Joe Biden's re-election chances.

There have been at least nine attacks on major Russian refineries this year, which have caused crude oil prices to jump in recent weeks.

The refinery, run by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tons per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Mr Azarov said.

'Retaliatory' attacks

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for more than two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

And Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital, Kyiv, in recent days.

During the current fiscal year, 2023-24, India has surpassed previous year's output of 937.22 million tonnes (MT) of coal and lignite by a margin of 25 days.

In addition, India has a sizeable coal reserve at the moment, with coal firms holding about 96 MT of coal. As of March 20, 2024, domestic thermal power plants that rely on coal have 46.25 MT of coal reserves.

""Mission 1 billion tonne was a milestone we had put in action a few years ago considering the burgeoning electricity requirements of our nation. This is a historic milestone in India's quest for energy security under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. The achievement of 1 billion tonne in coal and lignite production will ensure the lights are on in citizens' houses even as the coal sector continues to power up the economy,"" said Joshi.

This large coal stockpile guarantees a steady supply of energy across the country, which is essential for maintaining economic activity and satisfying the growing demand for electricity, particularly during periods of peak use, the minister added.

The accomplishment of India in breaking the 1 BT mark in coal and lignite output enhances the nation's energy security and lessens its need on coal imports, resulting in significant savings in foreign exchange reserves, the official statement said.

The SPA was signed on the sidelines of the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue 2024 under the auspices of H E Eng Salim bin Nasser al Aufi, Minister of Energy and Minerals. The agreement follows a prior commitment wherein Oman LNG signed a binding term-sheet agreement to supply SEFE with 0.4mn metric tonnes per annum of LNG starting in 2026.

The deal marks a milestone in the strategic energy partnership between Germany and Oman, as SEFE is the first German company to purchase Omani gas.

This strategic partnership reflects a significant step forward in bolstering the LNG supply chain, emphasising Oman LNG's commitment to meeting SEFE's energy needs, Oman LNG said in a statement.

By entering into this SPA, Oman LNG not only reinforces the sultanate's reputation as a reliable LNG provider but also demonstrates its adeptness in efficiently managing business operations to deliver secure and sustainable energy to global customers.

Hamed al Naamany, Chief Executive Officer of Oman LNG, said, ""The agreement marks a pivotal moment for both Oman LNG and SEFE, symbolising a profound step towards enhanced collaboration. The SPA stands as a testament to the mutual benefits derived from this partnership. For Oman LNG, it signifies access to new markets, technological advancements from Germany, and broader economic growth opportunities. Meanwhile, SEFE gains a reliable and trusted energy supplier, strengthening its position in the European market.""

Furthermore, this strategic partnership with SEFE serves to fortify Oman's ties with Germany, contributing significantly to energy security initiatives, opening up new opportunities for Oman LNG in the German market and beyond, underscoring its dedication to fostering growth and collaborative endeavors to enrich Oman's economy.

Dr. Egbert Leage, CEO of SEFE, said, ""SEFE is very proud to continue its path of increased cooperation with Oman and to be the front-runner among German companies in importing energy from the country. This partnership diversifies our portfolio and supports our goal to provide Europe with a secure energy supply. We look forward to this being the first of many agreements and also developing a trusting partnership in the hydrogen economy in the medium and long term.

As an integrated midstream energy company headquartered in Berlin, SEFE ensures the security of energy supply in Germany and Europe and drives the green energy transformation. The company is active in trading and portfolio management, sales, transportation, and storage of energy and has its strongest presence in Germany and the UK.

As part of its ongoing global marketing campaign, Oman LNG Company has signed several new binding long-term gas supply agreements since the beginning of 2023.

Here's what to know.","For nine months in a row, each month has set new heat records. That leaves the world's weather organizations and scientists concerned about the degree to which things continue to be so much warmer than normal -- and searching for reasons to explain why that is the case.

On Tuesday, as the United Nation's World Meteorological Organization released its annual report for 2023, Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said it's ""sounding the Red Alert to the world.""

""Never have we been so close - albeit on a temporary basis at the moment - to the 1.5° C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" Saulo said.

1.5° C:This number will shape Earth's future as the climate changes. You'll be hearing about it.

Both January and February this year were the warmest on record for the respective months of the year, making nine consecutive months of record warmth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.

In February, the global average temperature was 3.186 degrees (1.77 C) above the estimated pre-industrial average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European Union's earth observation program.

The global average temperature was also the highest on record for the 12-month period ending in February, Copernicus reported. It was more than 1.2 degrees over the 30-year average for 1991-2020 and 2.8 degrees (1.56 Celsius) over the estimated pre-industrial average

Although these global averages are above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold set in the Paris Agreement, it's not yet seen as exceeding the goal, because that is based on a long-term, consistent average rather than a measurement from any single month or year.

Still, it's cause for alarm, U.N. officials said this week.

""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators,"" said the U.N.'s Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday. ""Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding-up.""

It's normal for some weather records to be broken. What isn't so normal is the proportion of them related to warmer temperatures or the degree to which the new records shatter previous records by a long shot.

For example, in Quillayute, Washington last weekend, a weather station reported a daily record high of 80 degrees, smashing its previous record for the day by 16 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in Seattle.

""We're just trucking along,"" said Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central.

""We still don't quite know exactly what's driving that and that's worrisome to just have this big of a signal in the ocean,"" Pershing said. ""We expect the oceans to be warmer but this is really, really significant.""

On March 10, the globe's daily average sea surface temperature briefly jumped to a new record high of 70.16 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a chart kept by the Maine Climate Reanalyzer, using NOAA data.

""We're now at one year and counting of shattering the previous records for ocean heat,"" said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami. According to model projections, he said, the warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures ""look likely"" to continue over the next few months in the North Atlantic.

The temperature anomaly is even higher in the region of the Atlantic where most major hurricanes develop. For the first two months of the year, water temperatures in the region averaged nearly 3 degrees above normal over the previous century, blowing past a record previously set in 2010 by a full degree, according to NOAA.

Given a potential La Niña pattern in the Pacific and the warmer ocean temperatures, it doesn't bode well for the Atlantic hurricane season that begins June 1.

Warmest winter on record

What stands out to Pershing about this winter was the scope of the warming in the Upper Midwest. ""If you're somebody who grew up around the Great Lakes or you grew up in the kind of icy and snowy conditions in Wisconsin and Minnesota, that just was gone this year, and that's a huge change,"" he said, both psychologically and economically.

NOAA reported:

February made nine consecutive months of record warmth

""February joins the long streak of records of the last few months,"" said Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo. ""As remarkable as this might appear, it is not really surprising as the continuous warming of the climate system inevitably leads to new temperature extremes.""

Record heat is still puzzling scientists

Scientists don't fully understand why temperatures are up so much more than projected.

""It's humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists' predictive capabilities more than 2023 has,"" wrote NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt in an opinion piece this week in the journal Nature.

Atmospheric greenhouse gases are responsible for part of the increase, Schmidt said.

These other factors may be playing a role, but Schmidt said they don't fully explain the surge in temperatures:

Schmidt called for improved and faster data collection to help answer questions.

In general the 2023 temperature anomaly ""has come out of the blue, revealing an unprecedented knowledge gap"" since satellites began offering comprehensive views of the Earth's climate system, he said. ""If the anomaly does not stabilize by August -- a reasonable expectation based on previous El Niño events -- then the world will be in uncharted territory.""

""We need answers for why 2023 turned out to be the warmest year in possibly the past 100,000 years,"" Schmidt wrote. ""And we need them quickly.""

NASA's new PACE mission is expected to begin providing data later this year and should be invaluable, he said.

Glacial concerns

After significant losses last year, scientists remain concerned about the world's glaciers and sea ice.

""Climate change is about much more than temperatures. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern,"" said Saulo, the WMO secretary-general.

It can be caused by genetics or even environmental factors, such as the stress of the chemicals or treatments you put on it, but one thing remains the same: It can be a painful experience for many.

People with hair loss often seek ways to promote hair growth, with dietary changes and prescription medications being standard options. However, one of the safest yet most effective ways is to apply hair growth oil to their scalp and hair.

The only problem is that with so many natural hair oils on the market, it can be hard to tell the good from the bad. That is why we have made our guide to the ten best hair growth oils on the market in 2024, to help everyone combat hair loss and enjoy the kind of healthy hair growth they did when they were younger.

Reviewing The 10 Best Hair Growth Oils In 2024

Let's jump straight to our guide to the ten best hair growth oils of 2024. By assessing countless hair oiling options based on criteria like how well they aid hair growth, stop hair loss, moisturize and condition the scalp, and even how nice they smell, we have compiled a list with the perfect hair oil for everyone.

Toxique Serum is an all-in-one natural hair oil that has quickly established itself as the single best hair growth oil on the market. It is highly effective, and simply massaging the oil into your scalp can provide several benefits while making the scalp and hair smell delightful.

The range of essential oils it uses can boost blood flow to the hair follicles and strengthen them, aid hair growth, scalp health, and nutrient delivery, block DHT (dihydrotestosterone), stop hair loss, hair thinning, and inflammation, treat damaged hair, combat bacteria, and dry skin, and hydrate the scalp and hair.

Its various ingredients can offer other health benefits beyond those it provides for the hair and scalp, specifically regarding relaxation and stress. This is all while using only natural oils clinically proven to deliver all their claimed benefits.

Ingredients: rosemary oil, peppermint oil, castor oil (containing ricinoleic acid), lavender oil, and argan oil.

By blending many of the best oils for hair growth and being transparent with their formula, Toxique Serum has created a hair oil that can promote hair growth and improve scalp circulation from numerous angles.

While it may be pretty pricey, you only have to use a few drops, so it lasts a long time. As a result, we feel that Toxique Serum is easily the best hair growth oil on the market today, and we strongly suggest that anyone worried about thinning hair or hair loss give it a try.

Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp Oil - Best Hair Growth Oil For Scalp Health

Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp Oil is a hair oil made from 30 essential oils, medium-chain fatty acids, nutrients, and vitamins. It is also paraben, sulfate, DEA, paraffin, and mineral oil-free and not tested on animals so that it can be used by virtually everyone worried about their hair.

It aims to stimulate hair growth, nourish and condition the scalp and follicles, prevent dryness, and help smooth split ends. Its anti-inflammatory properties improve scalp health and repair damaged hair. It can also prevent dandruff, promote relaxation, and make the hair smell nice.

Its ingredients can then offer several other benefits beyond promoting healthy hair growth. However, it must be noted that with the number of ingredients it contains and the small serving size, the amount of each present will be low, and we don't know how low as no quantities are listed.

Ingredients: castor oil, lavender oil, rosemary oil, peppermint oil, biotin, soybean oil, aloe vera oil, holy basil leaf oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, tea tree oil, rice bran oil, patchouli oil, sweet almond oil, sage oil, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil, grapeseed oil, vitamin A, vitamin E, and glycerine.

A very reasonably priced product that contains several proven essential oils, fatty acids, and vitamins, Mielle Rosemary Mint Scalp Oil can provide several benefits for the hair and scalp while making both smell great.

Sure, some issues with its quantities may limit how much it will increase hair growth. However, if you are looking for a pre-wash scalp oil that can stop you from getting a dry scalp and balance your scalp pH, it is still one of the best oils.

Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density - Best Hair Growth Oil For Thick Hair

Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum is a lightweight, water-based hair oil produced by one of the top names in hair and skincare worldwide. It is explicitly designed to strengthen the hair and scalp and help grow thicker, healthy hair.

Its ingredients can increase hair growth, moisturization, strengthen each hair follicle, stop hair loss or dry hair, promote hair regrowth, block DHT, stimulate blood flow to the hair follicles, moisturize the scalp, and offer several antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties.

We have to point out that many of the ingredients in this hair oil have not yet been conclusively proven to deliver all of their benefits. That means, while we know it can benefit people with thin hair, it is unclear whether this is true.

Ingredients: caffeine, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Larix Europaea wood extract, pea extract, Chinese skullcap extract, wheatgerm extract, soybean extract, red clover extract, and camellia sinensis leaf extract.

Ordinary is a respected company, and its hair oil is undoubtedly one of the better options for people seeking a little more body or volume.

Sure, some ingredients need a little more research to prove their effectiveness. If you are trying to achieve a thicker mane, Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum is still one of the best hair growth oils, especially if you struggle with thin hair.

Artnaturals Organic Rosemary & Castor Hair Growth Oil - Best Organic Hair Oil

Artnatrurals Organic Rosemary & Castor Hair Growth Oil is an organic hair oil containing no sulfates, parabens, mineral oils, dyes, silicone, or alcohol. While you would think being so careful with its ingredients would bump the price up, it is also one of the cheaper hair oils.

The formula is designed so people can use a few drops to stimulate follicles, promote growth, strengthen, nourish, moisturize, and condition the hair and scalp.

The only issue here is that using just four ingredients is a little limiting, as it reduces the number of ways in which the product can benefit the hair.

Ingredients: rosemary, castor, coconut, and olive oil.

Artnatrurals Organic Rosemary & Castor Hair Growth Oil is one of today's best hair oils.

Admittedly, it does not contain many ingredients, and one or two of those it uses could be swapped out for superior options. Despite these minor issues, though, if you are seeking a hair oil that uses exclusively organic ingredients, there is probably no better option for you to try.

Wild Growth Hair Oil is designed to combat thinning hair and promote healthy growth while being affordable for people shopping on the tightest budgets.

Ingredients like lavender, peppermint, and coconut oil improve blood circulation, strengthen the hair and follicles, prevent loss, and promote growth. They can also offer several benefits for the hair and scalp while leaving a pleasant smell.

That said, several experimental ingredients, such as jojoba oil, make it such an affordable hair oil. However, it is not guaranteed to promote hair growth to the same extent as others.

Ingredients: coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, rice bran oil, cocoa oil, acerola oil, pumpkin seed oil, pomegranate oil, clary sage oil, eucalyptus oil, frankincense oil, geranium oil, grapefruit oil, peppermint oil, lavender oil, and the extracts of mushrooms, chickpeas, lentils, cocoa beans, and sesame seeds.

Wild Growth Hair Oil is affordable for those on a tight budget who want to increase their hair growth.

Sure, some ingredients, like jojoba oil, need more research to prove their effectiveness, but this is expected with such a reasonably priced product. It still contains several ingredients that promote hair growth, but it is still more than worth a try.

African Pride Moisture Miracle - Best For Afro Hair

African Pride Moisture Miracle has created a formula based primarily on five oils: argan oil, castor oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil, as well as a healthy dose of vitamin E. The idea is that it has been designed explicitly as hair oil for people with afro hair or similar hair types.

It is formulated to nourish and promote hair growth while protecting against heat or sun damage. It also makes the hair and cuticles smooth and silky, prevents scalp inflammation and conditions, and hydrates and moisturizes the hair. Additionally, it helps prevent breakages and repairs that have already occurred.

However, it must be pointed out that it contains quite a lengthy list of hidden ingredients and is not suitable for people with non-Afro hairstyles.

Ingredients: coconut oil, soybean oil, olive oil, grape seed oil, castor seed oil, alkyl benzoate, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, fragrance, vitamin E, jojoba oil, argan oil, alpha iso methyl ionone, benzyl benzoate, benzyl alkylate, geraniol, limonene, and linalool.

African Pride Moisture Miracle is a fabulous option for people with afro hair who are worried about hair loss or simply seeking to maintain healthy hair. Blending things like argan oil and vitamin E can cater to the specific needs of that type of hair.

While many hidden ingredients are not ideal and will not suit everyone, especially if you have fine hair, it is one of the best options for people with afro hairstyles.

Kate Blanc Cosmetics Castor Oil - Most Popular Hair Oil

Kate Blanc Cosmetics Castor Oil is Amazon's most popular hair oil; over a hundred thousand bottles have already been bought. Made exclusively from cold-pressed organic castor oil, it is 100 percent organic and can condition hair anywhere from the scalp to the beard or eyelashes.

It can stimulate hair growth, protect against harmful bacteria that cause loss or thinning, moisturize and condition the hair and skin, and support strands and follicles. It is also extremely reasonably priced.

We need to point out the obvious, though, that using just a single ingredient does not benefit your hair in as many ways as a more diverse hair oil would.

While using just one ingredient limits the range of benefits it can offer, if you are looking for a reasonably priced, organic, trendy hair oil that you can trust to work, Kate Blanc Cosmetics Castor Oil is a great option.

Like our previous entry, Dabur Amla Hair Oil contains only one ingredient, amla oil, which limits its range of benefits. This could seem even more of an issue here, as amla oil is less proven to promote hair growth.

However, amla oil shines in its ability to make hair smooth and shiny while gently aiding hair growth. With a reasonable price tag, Dabur Amla Hair Oil becomes the best for people who prioritize the appearance of their hair, with growth a secondary concern.

Dabur Amla Hair Oil may not be the best option for people looking for ways to solve chronic hair loss. However, if you prioritize making your hair look nice while gentling and boosting hair growth, there may not be a better option, especially if you are shopping on a budget.

HairGrowthCo 10-In-1 Hair Growth Oil - Best Smelling Hair Growth Oil

HairGrowthCo 10-In-1 Hair Growth Oil is a relatively new product that combines ten natural oils. They claim that if you apply Hair Growth Oil to the scalp, you can achieve a level of hair regrowth that compares to prescription medications like minoxidil, using only organic, natural ingredients.

While using some ingredients with limited research to support them, such as chebe powder, is not ideal, the oil can reasonably aid hair growth. Its lemongrass scent makes it one of the best-smelling hair growth oils.

Ingredients: chebe powder, organic peppermint, rosemary, castor, lavender, avocado, coconut, sunflower seed, lemongrass, macadamia, grape seed, and argan oil.

HairGrowthCo 10-in-1 Hair Growth Oil is a fantastic-smelling oil that can help promote hair growth. While some of its ingredients need to be researched more extensively, it can be a great choice with people for whom smelling great is as important as looking good.

Follixil Minoxidil USP 5% - Best Hair Oil With Minoxidil

Follixil Minoxidil USP 5% is a hair oil that combines the potent hair growth chemical minoxidil with several natural ingredients. Extremely popular on TikTok, it can promote an impressive level of hair growth while taking steps to combat some of the side effects that minoxidil can cause.

Admittedly, it does not eliminate all of the side effects, and you may see some of the symptoms that put people off of using minoxidil in the first place. However, it's reasonably priced, and the side effects are minimal, considering what it contains.

Ingredients: minoxidil, caffeine, biotin, niacinamide.

Minoxidil is a potent hair growth tonic but can also cause several side effects. However, if you are set on using a hair oil that makes the most of its benefits, Follixil Minoxidil USP 5% is the way to go, as it is very reasonably priced and takes steps to keep the side effects to a minimum.

PETALING JAYA: Air quality in Miri, Sarawak, has worsened as peat fires within the district created fog-like conditions with strong odours.

The fire and rescue department has advised the public in Miri, especially those with respiratory conditions, to stay indoors because of peat fires in the Adong area, the Borneo Post reported.

""The department received reports of a fire on peatlands around 10am today,"" it said, with firemen still working on putting out the fire as of 4.15pm.

About 21 hectares of peatland and forest were already destroyed in the blaze, which was expected to spread further, said Awangku Hazmin Awang Zainal of the fire and rescue department.

The fire broke out between a private plantation and the Permyjaya area, he added.

Meanwhile, Sarawak transport minister Lee Kim Shin ordered all agencies under the Miri disaster management committee to be on ""action mode"" over the fires.

He said landowners near the affected areas were also told to activate their fire breakers and flood their land to prevent the fire from spreading there. ""The landowners can work with the fire and rescue department to put out fires in their land. They should take action as soon as they see a fire and not wait for it to spread,"" he said.

In view of the impending dry spell, he said the public have been urged to avoid carrying out open burning. ""We want to prevent haze from reoccurring.

This nourishing oil won't leave your locks looking like you stuck your head in a 'grease trap'","This celebrity hairstylist-approved essential promises to increase shine by 75% without weighing hair down -- and over 7,000 shoppers are hooked.

If you're mourning the thick, shiny locks of your youth, you're not alone. Age might bring wisdom, but it also dulls and thins your hair! Finding something to return your strands to the sheen of their glossy glory days without weighing them down can be challenging, but we'd like to introduce you to Verb Ghost Oil. It's available on Amazon and is celebrity hairstylist-approved.

This stuff is made for the stars -- it's even graced the locks of celebs like Salma Hayek at Hollywood's most sparkling affair. Her hairstylist, Jennifer Yepez, used the Ghost Oil to get the actress primped and primed for the Oscars in 2023. She also used the brand's Glossy Shine Spray and Volume Texture Spray.

The multitasking elixir promises to enhance shine by up to 75%, fight frizz and flyaways and hydrate hair all at the same time. It's made with good-for-hair ingredients like argan oil and bamboo extract, but the star ingredient is moringa oil. It's loaded with antioxidants, including oleic acid, which hydrates and moisturizes skin and hair.

You can use Ghost Oil as a leave-in treatment for extra hydration, but it can also be used before styling to protect your hair from a curling iron or hairdryer, or you can use it as a finishing oil for added shine. The lightweight oil won't weigh your hair down, and it's free from harmful sulfates and parabens, so you can feel good about putting it on your hair.

More than 7,000 Amazon shoppers have already awarded Ghost Oil a stunning five-star rating.

""The Verb Ghost oil is my favorite hair oil because it's weightless,"" a rave reviewer shared. ""I'm so impressed with this hair oil! My hair looks nourished and hydrated without looking like I stuck my head in a McDonald's Grease trap. I highly recommend if you have frizzy and [untamable] hair. Or just want to give an extra boost of nourishment and shine.""

""Listen, I used to never blow dry my hair because it got super frizzy,"" a beauty enthusiast wrote. ""This stuff is GAME CHANGING. I now put this in my hair before I blow dry with a Revlon brush (heat protectant too!!) and I get almost no frizz. It smells SO good and makes my hair super soft and shiny. I have random girls coming up to me at the bar and asking how my hair still looks good, and I tell them about this stuff. I've made all my friends feel how soft my hair is now. I literally can't stop talking about my hair since I started using this.""

""Believe the hype,"" urged a five-star fan. ""This stuff actually does what it says it does. For one thing, it doesn't weigh your hair down, even with my thinning hair. It also makes it soft with a nice mellow scent. I've been using it every day since I got it and I'm super impressed.""

""Verb Ghost is the only oil that will tame my fine brittle hair,"" shared a happy shopper. ""I apply it while my hair is air drying. The next morning, I will apply it to flyaways. I've tried sooo many different hair oils. This one actually works without greasy-looking hair.""

Barely a year ago, the Austin, Texas, native had a day job and experimented with posting his music online on a whim. Fueled by the success of his debut, ""To Be Free,"" which amassed more than 3 million Spotify streams, and his breakout, ""Coal,"" Gossett can seemingly do no wrong at the moment. He is early in his No Better Time headlining tour, which this week included sold-out shows in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Chicago with support from Ole 60, another band in the midst of an unexpected rise into the stratosphere.

Now, Gossett -- who turned 25 earlier this month -- is working to build a catalog that matches his soaring popularity. His second EP, the four-song Songs in the Gravel, hits streaming platforms on Friday. The first single, ""Somewhere Between,"" has been out since March 1.

""I really wanted to make sure this EP was out as soon as possible with this spring tour so that the fans have more songs they can recognize and enjoy,"" Gossett tells Rolling Stone.

The EP, the songwriter's second after last fall's No Better Time, is written entirely by Gossett, who says he was inspired by his formative years playing songs around a campfire at his grandfather's house on Lake Buchanan, near Burnet, Texas.

""Growing up there, I fell in love with music as my family and I spent weekends and holidays sitting in the gravel around the campfire playing songs -- years before I ever even dreamed of a music career,"" he says. ""I wanted to let my audience into that world.""

Gossett chose a photo of one of those campfires as the cover of the EP.

The collection mixes storytelling and self-reflection, and Gossett delivers with authority in his voice. His vocals are classically raspy, but he has a range and confidence in his singing that slyly commands a listener's attention.

Gossett is also touring with a band after a year of performing solo. His Texas-based five-piece made its debut this month during South by Southwest at Rolling Stone's Future of Music Showcase, held at ACL Live at the Moody Theater -- It was Gossett's first time playing with a band.

When you would sit by the fire playing songs, what kind of music were you playing, and what was influencing you?

During Easter or Christmas, when the whole family is there, everybody sits around a campfire and starts passing around guitars. It's usually me, my brother and my cousin -- just kind of singing songs with everyone singing along. That's what inspired the song ""Bitter Winds,"" which is a personal reflection of how fast time is going. I even have a line in there where I say, ""My feet are buried in the gravel."" That's very real stuff to me. Having the title be Songs in the Gravel, and the cover art be from there, it's super special.

You're putting this EP out ahead of an anticipated headlining tour, as your fanbase is expanding by the day. What do you hope the spring and summer holds for your music?

I just hope we can keep doing this. I try not to get caught up too much in something like, ""Am I making music that's gonna go viral?"" How we started this thing was that I make music I really, really like, and that I really enjoy. I think that people can feel that, and in turn, they enjoy it, too. I want to keep touring, and I hope that people keep showing up and that they enjoy the shows. That's the goal.""

What's the backstory to ""Finally Stop Dreaming""? It's such an eerie song.

It was really written as part storytelling, part self-reflection. The point of it really is, whenever I stop dreaming, or whenever I stop chasing whatever I'm going for, I'm basically just ready to go. It's about dreaming until the very last second. And when I'm done dreaming, I'll go without screaming and remember all the good times. It's a really good reflection, for me, on where I am in my life right now, and how things are moving for us. Plus, my wife is with me every step of the way, and that's helping fuel the fire for me.",rollingstone.com,news,Rolling Stone,Josh Crutchmer,0.2784313725490195,448896870,1,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dylan-Gossett-6-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,

Join us in this fight.

A fire that broke out at the Kuibyshev oil refinery in Russia's Samara region overnight on March 23 had been caused by a drone attack, the regional government told Russian state-controlled news agency Interfax, citing Governor Dmitry Azarov.

In the past weeks, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia's oil industry. Ukraine has hit oil refineries in multiple regions deep inside Russian territory.

Drones attacked oil refineries in the Samara region at night, followed by a primary oil refining column at the Kuibyshev facility catching fire, said Azarov. There were no casualties, he added.

The fire was extinguished in the morning, the regional authorities told Interfax.

Local residents previously reported explosions at the refinery and said the facility was on fire, according to Russian Telegram news channels.

Ukrainian forces previously struck the Kuibyshev oil refinery on March 16 in a drone strike that also targeted the region's Syzran refinery. Only the Syzran facility caught fire following the attack, Russian officials claimed.

Both refineries are owned by Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company.

Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on March 22 that Russia's oil refineries are ""absolutely legitimate targets"" for the Ukrainian military. Her statement followed media reports that the U.S. had asked Ukraine to stop attacking the Russian oil industry.

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak denied the reports, saying Kyiv did not receive any such calls from Washington.

Fashion retailer Flannels, in Liverpool city centre, closed its doors earlier today after reports of a smell of gas. A number of people were outside the doors awaiting the reopening, as security turned customers away, when the ECHO visited the scene on Saturday morning.

Gas maintenance company, Cadent, has now shed more light on the incident. A spokesperson said: ""Gas emergency service Cadent, was called to Flannels this morning after two reports of a smell of gas. Emergency engineers were sent to the streets around the department store to investigate.

""The reports of the smell of gas came from one of the shops within Flannels and this is being investigated. We understand Flannels decided to evacuate the store as a safety precaution.

""Once we have completed our investigation inside and outside of the store, we will allow people back into the store only when we feel it is safe to do so.""

Flannels' flagship store opened in June 2022, in the former Owen Owen building which previously housed a Tesco Metro. It includes a ground-floor Italian restaurant and huge beauty floor.

Last week a large area on the edge of the city centre was cordoned off due to a suspected gas leak. Costco and Home Bargains in Vauxhall were among the areas affected.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the U.S. National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Neb., where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, N.Y. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometres) east of Austin.

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometres) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pa., owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Mo., extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tenn., to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometres) outside the city limits warning of delays.

The gas cloud is unlikely to cause any serious health problems. However, it could impact the ozone hole above the Arctic, experts warn.

On March 16, an underground volcano in Icealnd's Reykjanes Peninsula blew its top for the fourth time in as many months, opening up the largest fissure of the current eruption cycle and unleashing a massive lava flow that narrowly missed the evacuated town of Grindavík. There were initially fears that the lava flow could reach the sea and unleash a plume of hydrochloric acid, which would have been ""life-threatening"" to anyone close to the coastline, Live Science previously reported. However, the lava never reached the shore.

But the eruption did release sulfur dioxide -- a colorless, toxic gas that can be extremely dangerous in high concentrations.

On March 17, the volcano was spitting out around 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of sulfur dioxide every second, according to a translated statement from the Icelandic Met Office. Workers at the nearby Svartsengi power plant were evacuated from the facility due to high levels of the gas, Icelandic news site RÚV reported, and locals were temporarily warned to stay inside, according to Iceland's Civil Protection.

Sulfur dioxide emissions have diminished significantly since March 18, but new data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) -- part of the European Union's Copernicus program, which tracks weather and climate changes using satellite data -- shows that the initial outpouring of gas formed a 3-mile-tall (5 kilometers) concentrated column that has since blown toward other countries in northern Europe.

The gas plume has already passed above the U.K. and is currently approaching Scandinavia, where it will begin to dissipate before entering Russia.

CAMS will continue to track the plume ""although we don't expect there to be any impact on surface air quality or climate,"" senior CAMS scientist Mark Parrington said in a statement emailed to Live Science.

However, tracking sulfur dioxide emissions is still important because the gas can react with atmospheric ozone molecules, depleting the amount of this protective substance in the ozone layer, which shields Earth's surface from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

In October 2023, scientists partially attributed the near-record-largest ozone hole above Antarctica to the 2022 eruption of an underwater volcano in Tonga, which released high levels of water vapor into the atmosphere that may have depleted ozone levels.

Experts predict that the recent eruptions in Iceland could be the beginning of a new centuries-long period of activity in the region. As a result, the amount of sulfur dioxide being pumped toward the Arctic could also rise over the next few years, which could lead to larger northern ozone holes in the future.

Ukraine attacked Russia's oil infrastructure after US officials advised them against targeting Russian oil refineries, Bloomberg reports.

Russia's oil infrastructure took another hit as drones targeted refineries in the Samara region.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery narrowly escaped damage, while the Kuibyshev refinery suffered a fire in one of its refining columns, Gov. Dmitry Azarov said.

The US has urged Ukraine to halt these attacks, according to The Financial Times, due to concerns over potential oil price increases and retaliation from Russia.

Responders managed to contain the blaze in Samara, averting a potential disaster at the facility, which boasts an annual oil processing capacity of 7 million tons, it was reported.

The targeted refineries, both part of Rosneft PJSC's Samara region group, play a crucial role in Russia's oil production landscape.

Footage distributed on social media claimed to show a Russian refinery ablaze in Samara last night. Business Insider was not able to verify its origins.

'Absolutely legitimate targets from a military point of view'

Ukraine's drone strikes on Russia's oil industry have inflicted significant damage, reducing processing capacity by 10%, said a

British defense intelligence update on Saturday.

""These strikes are imposing a financial cost on Russia, impacting the domestic fuel market. Depending on the extent of the damage, major repairs could take considerable time and expense. Sanctions are highly likely increasing the time and cost of sourcing replacement equipment,"" said the UK Ministry of Defence.

The strikes have targeted refineries, storage depots, and other key sites, exacerbating economic pain and raising fears of further escalation.

Another US concern at Ukraine's degrading of Russia's energy infrastructure, the FT said, is that Russia could retaliate by targeting energy infrastructure the West relies on, such as the CPC pipeline that transports oil from Kazakhstan to global markets.

According to Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna, officials in Kyiv believe that the refineries are ""absolutely legitimate targets from a military point of view.""

""We understand the calls of our American partners,"" she said. ""At the same time, we are fighting with the capabilities, resources, and practices that we have.""

It's not the first time the Biden administration has attempted to rein in Kyiv over its war strategy.

It previously warned Ukraine against using US-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.

Ukraine got around this ban by developing its own weapons that could strike inside Russia. Indeed, the refineries targeted in the Samara oblast last night are over 800 miles from Kyiv.

On Thursday, Russia retaliated against Ukraine's energy hubs, including the country's largest dam, with a wave of missiles and drones that left a million people without power.

The Turkish government's decision to grant licenses to the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) for oil exploration in three areas of the Sea of Marmara has drawn sharp criticism from environmental experts, the Sol Haber news website reported.

According to an announcement by the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry's General Directorate of Mining and Petroleum Affairs, TPAO is now authorized to carry out oil exploration off the coast of Tekirdağ, Balıkesir and Çanakkale in a total area of tens of thousands of hectares over the next eight years.

This controversial decision, which was published in the latest issue of the Official Gazette on Saturday, has provoked a sharp rebuke from the İstanbul branch of the Chamber of Environmental Engineers (ÇMO).

In a statement the organization said, ""Take your hands off the Sea of Marmara,"" pointing out the serious environmental threats posed by potential oil exploration and drilling to the sea's ecosystem.

The Sea of Marmara, which was declared a Special Environmental Protection Area in 2021 due to its rich biodiversity and its important role as a biological corridor between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, is already under significant environmental pressure. Pointing to the falling oxygen levels, rising temperatures and recurring sea snot problems plaguing the sea, the chamber warned that oil exploration could cause irreparable damage to the sea's biodiversity and ecosystems. The threat of an oil spill, they argued, would spell disaster for the inland sea and the life forms that depend on it.

The statement also criticized Turkey's continued investment in fossil fuels such as oil and coal as contradicting its commitments under the Paris Agreement to combat global warming. The ÇMO calls for immediate clean-up measures for the Sea of Marmara and urges a shift away from fossil fuels towards clean energy to ensure a sustainable future.",turkishminute.com,news,turkishminute.com,Turkish Minute,0.1215686274509804,448895633,1,https://www.turkishminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/000_9UD9M2.jpg,

As of March 22, the national average gas price stood at $3.53 per gallon, $0.26 higher than a month ago, according to AAA data.

Gasoline prices have been steadily climbing higher, increasing by nearly $0.10 in the last week as higher oil prices and falling inventories put upward pressure on fuel costs. Drivers could see sharper increases in the weeks ahead.

""This is the time of year we normally see pump prices start to rise,"" Andrew Gross, a AAA spokesperson, said in a statement on March 14. ""And while prices have been rather pokey so far, they should begin to accelerate and move higher very soon.""

GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance Live in late February he sees gas prices rising another $0.20 to $0.50 per gallon by Memorial Day as ""seasonal ups and downs"" come into view.

While some of the disruptions from COVID-19 and the initial shocks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine dissipate, other catalysts could support higher oil prices -- and, therefore, gas prices -- as the summer draws nearer.

Last week, gas demand decreased slightly to 8.81 million barrels per day from 9.04 million barrels the week before. Although lower demand normally contributes to easing pump prices, higher oil prices counteracted that pressure and ushered in the higher cost of gas, according to AAA.

The national average is now more expensive than a year ago for the first time since December, putting hopes of a $3 average well out of reach. Gas prices had been declining between September 2023 and January of this year to a one-year low of $3.07 before snapping that streak. The last time the national average gas price fell below $3 was in May 2021.

""Most years see a greater seasonal advance than what has occurred so far this year,"" OPIS head of energy analysis Tom Kloza wrote Yahoo Finance in an email. ""However, it is an election year, so there is more scrutiny than normal. March and April will most likely see a quickening in the pace, and there is an inordinate amount of refining capacity that is either down for planned maintenance or down because of problems that cropped up with the winter cold snaps.""

More than half of the price consumers pay at the pump comes from crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Oil demand and the production targets set by the largest oil producers, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies (OPEC+), play an important role in gas price fluctuations.

The OPEC+ announced earlier this month it is extending production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day through the second quarter, which sent oil prices higher.

Geopolitical risks have also put upward pressure on prices. Escalating Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries led several oil facilities to suspend operations, sending global crude prices higher.

And ongoing attacks against vessels in the Red Sea by the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, have become a wild card for oil prices in 2024. The attacks by Houthi rebels have prompted energy and shipment companies to avoid the Red Sea region that connects to the Suez Canal, a critical pathway between Asia and Europe.

""I think right now the Middle East is something we continue to watch, though there hasn't been much impact [on oil prices],"" De Haan said. ""The Middle East could certainly change. We've seen situations where things drastically change overnight, and of course, there's a lot of crude oil being produced in the Middle East.""

At the same time, crude oil prices aren't the only factor driving gas prices. Seasonality, refining capacity, and distribution also influence prices.

""This is the time of year that there's a lot of pressure on refineries,"" De Haan explained. ""They are doing maintenance before the summer. They are transitioning over to summer gasoline. In the background, demand is all going up at the same time. That puts a lot of pressure on refineries to finish that maintenance, to get back online and boost production.""

Gasoline prices typically rise heading into the spring as more motorists get on the road after a winter lull.

State and federal gas taxes also contribute to the overall cost of filling up. In California, the state with the highest gas tax, taxes add up to $0.51 of the overall price per gallon, while drivers in Alaska pay just $0.09 per gallon.

Furthermore, gas prices act as a barometer for how consumers feel about the economy, factor into elections, and contribute to the larger inflation story that prompted the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hike campaign.

Higher gas prices in February were one of the main drivers behind a surprising rise in inflation reported earlier this year.

When my mom got pregnant with me in 1950, my dad, whose lifetime ambition had been to be a history professor, decided to abandon the GI Bill, drop out of college, and go to work in a steel plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan to financially prepare for their new arrival. It was hot, dirty work and the steel came out of the furnace over asbestos-covered rollers, leaving Dad working in a cloud of the stuff.

In 2006, Dad was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an insanely painful and ultimately 100% deadly disease. I tracked down a lawyer who did suits on behalf of asbestos victims, and he showed up to depose Dad on videotape along with more than a dozen asbestos industry lawyers, several of whom were quite verbally abusive to Dad. They barely fit into my parent's small living room and left my father in tears.

After the lawyers' fees, I think Mom ended up with around $135,000, which was better than nothing, although the industry lawyers had filed an appeal that forced him back to the hospital for a painful second biopsy to ""prove"" he had mesothelioma. And then they procrastinated so long that the money didn't come until after he'd died. These were Trump-style-relentless lawyers representing a murderous industry that had known since the 1930s that their product caused this exact disease.

Every senior executive in the industry for the more-than-70 years between the time they discovered how deadly asbestos was and my Dad's death knew. And participated in the cover-up.

Just like the executives in the tobacco industry, who have known with certainty that they were peddling death and disease since the 1940s and are today responsible for an estimated half-million American deaths every year, including my younger brother Stan who died of COPD last year.

""Psychopath"" is the only word that adequately describes these executives, their decision-making employees, and their hired-gun marketers who make millions knowingly selling poisons.

And now comes the fossil fuel industry, with a whole new crop of psychopathic executives, marketers, and attorneys. Burning their products produces air pollution that causes asthma, cancer, heart disease, and strokes; according to Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Medicine, an estimated 350,000 Americans die prematurely every year because of this industry's products.

And that doesn't scratch the surface of the death and destruction on the horizon, as severe weather driven by global warming from fossil fuel emissions kick in. Such events have cost America over $2 trillion and more than 16,000 lives just since Ronald Reagan began denying the science in 1980. Over 60,000 people died in Europe just last year from a series of severe heatwaves.

A new study from the international NGO Global Witness documents how there could be 11.5 million excess deaths from global warming worldwide by 2100 just based on the emissions of five companies between now and 26 years from now: Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, and Chevron.

And now we learned that the industry, which has been publicly praising the Paris Accords around reducing emissions and getting climate change under control, have been lying to us again and instead are -- across the board -- increasing their production of their toxic products.

This and other analyses of the death and destruction wrought by the fossil fuel industry's carbon pollution have led a number of legal experts to suggest that now may be the time to lay the foundation for the prosecution of fossil fuel companies and their executives for murder or, at the least, manslaughter.

This would not be a new or novel event.

California utility PG&E was convicted of multiple manslaughter counts and paid $3.5 million in fines when their decision to use money that could have upgraded or buried their power lines -- but instead went to millions in bonuses and stock buy-backs for their senior executives -- led to the death of 85 people in the Camp Fire that consumed the town of Paradise.

Similarly, when BP's failure to properly use and maintain their blowout preventers led to 11 deaths (and a massive oil spill) in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, that company pleaded guilty to manslaughter. BP and PG&E ultimately paid billions in fines and compensation.

A new analysis published in the Harvard Environmental Law Review (Vol. 48, No. 1, 2024) titled Climate Homicide: Prosecuting Big Oil For Climate Deaths lays out the case for holding fossil fuel industry executives and their companies accountable for the deaths they are causing as you read these words.

""For decades,"" the authors write, ""fossil fuel companies ('FFCs') have known that their product causes 'globally catastrophic' climate change. Rather than warn the public or alter their business models, they waged a multi-decade disinformation campaign to sow doubt and delay regulatory responses.

""Today, as experts continue developing and delivering ever more detailed and precise warnings of climate catastrophe, and vast numbers of people are killed at an accelerating rate by wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other climate-related calamities, FFCs continue to expand the production, marketing, and sale of the products they have long understood to cause mass death.

""Activists and journalists have called executives of major oil companies 'mass murderers,' lamenting that 'millions of human beings will die so that they can have private planes and huge mansions,' and a growing chorus of communities devastated by FFCs' lethal conduct have begun to demand accountability.""

The authors are blunt, arguing that these executives and their companies are knowingly complicit in the deaths of millions of people in America and around the world, with the numbers starting to explode as we cross multiple climate tipping points.

And still, like the asbestos and tobacco executives of the last century, instead of mitigating the harms of their products, they instead fight every effort at transparency or accountability.

""As additional evidence of FFCs' knowledge of the lethal risks they were generating surfaces through leaks and court-mandated discovery, obstacles to a successful prosecution [for murder or manslaughter] are falling away. At the same time, with every new wave of climate-related deaths, the justification for prosecution grows.

""Although some of the harmful externalities that FFCs generate may be suitable for tort or regulatory suits, the lethality of FFCs' conduct, their awareness of the risks they are generating, and their efforts to obscure those risks make criminal prosecution for homicide particularly appropriate.

""Perhaps most importantly, if FFCs continue to fight against all major efforts to reduce the harms they are generating, and if they continue to obstruct or delay state and federal regulation and civil suits designed to reduce the lethal impact of their conduct, then homicide prosecutions may prove necessary to prevent the escalating threat that their lethal conduct poses to millions of potential victims in the United States.""

Indeed, at a conference in Houston this week, Saudi Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, was explicit with a comment that drew loud applause from his oil industry audience:

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately.""

Similarly, Fortune magazine reported last month that the fossil fuel industry is positioning itself to be the largest donor to the Trump campaign, having already given him over $7 million following his recent promises to ""drill, baby, drill"" and to end all subsidies for electric vehicles and solar or wind power projects.

""Californians should be wise enough to see this messaging for what it is: The behavior of a threatened, greed-driven industry trying to trick us into letting it hold onto its dirty and harmful old ways of doing business.""

This denial of the crisis and doubling down on advertising and more emissions is, of course, no solution.

In past articles here on Hartmann Report, I've argued for the US government to nationalize the three largest American fossil fuel companies by purchasing their stock in the marketplace; the total cost would be less than the Trump tax cuts for billionaires, and with new management the companies could help our nation's transition away from its addiction to oil, coal, and natural gas.

Today there are families all across the country who are mourning the loss of their loved ones to climate-change-fueled floods, heatstroke, and violent weather as much as I grieved my father's death at the hands of the asbestos industry executives.

They deserve justice, and the industry needs a wake-up call like the asbestos industry got in the late 1990s, leading to a wave of bankruptcies.

Holding murderous executives and their rogue companies bent on profiting from unnecessary death and destruction is imperative. As New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin noted a few months ago:

""Based on their own research, these companies understood decades ago that their products were causing climate change and would have devastating environmental impacts down the road.

""They went to great lengths to hide the truth and mislead the people of New Jersey and the world. In short, these companies put their profits ahead of our safety. It's long overdue that the facts be aired in a New Jersey court and the perpetrators of the disinformation campaign pay for the harms they've caused.""

Russia pounded Ukraine's power facilities on Friday, striking a vast dam over the Dnipro river, killing at least five people, leaving more than a million others across seven regions without electricity, and briefly cutting off power to a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram that the ""technical possibility for electricity supply"" had been restored in most affected regions, but that the situation in the eastern Kharkiv region remained difficult.

Moscow said it unleashed its devastating aerial assault in retaliation for recent Ukrainian strikes targeting oil refineries and other energy facilities inside Russia, signalling a potential escalation of the war just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.

According to Ukrainska Pravda, Russian Telegram channels reported a blaze ripped through the Kuibyshev oil refinery in the country's Samara Oblast region after local residents said they heard an explosion, with regional authorities saying the cause was a drone.

Russia unleashed one of its most devastating attacks against Ukraine's electric sector on Friday, an aerial assault it said was retaliation for recent strikes inside Russia and which could signal an escalation of the war just days after President Vladimir Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.

Many Ukrainians were plunged into darkness across several cities, at least five people were killed, and damage to the country's largest hydroelectric plant briefly cut off power to a nuclear plant that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

Russia fired off more than 60 exploding drones and 90 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as the most brutal attack against its energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began in early 2022.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, sustained the most damage, officials said, and the attack came a day after Russia had fired 31 missiles into the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Russia's defense ministry called Friday attacks ""strikes of retribution"", signalling a potential escalation of the war just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.

The island's socialist-led government, in office since April, has made climate concerns central to its legislative program. While the decision to scrap planned exploration is a win for environmental groups, it cuts off potential investments that could have aided efforts to gain economic independence from Denmark.

The government ""has decided to cease issuing new licenses for oil and gas exploration,"" it said in a statement. ""This step has been taken for the sake of our nature, for the sake of our fisheries, for the sake of our tourism industry, and to focus our business on sustainable potentials.""

Ten years ago, Greenland had become a hotspot for drillers as a commodity-price boom attracted not only oil explorers but miners of diamonds, iron, rare earths and other metals. But crude's subsequent crash made extraction uneconomic offshore -- where drilling would be hampered by large floating icebergs -- and the official ban now puts an end to dreams of energy riches.

Although the Inuit Ataqatigiit ruling party campaigned on seeking greater autonomy from Denmark -- which still oversees Greenland's foreign, defense and monetary policies -- its program has yet to offer a sustainable alternative to Danish economic support for its 56,000 inhabitants, which amounts to about $600 million a year.

The decision to abandon oil exploration comes amid increasingly alarming signs of global warming for Greenlanders. Average sea levels have risen about 9 inches since 1880, and about a quarter of that increase comes from ice melting in the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, along with land-based glaciers elsewhere, according to a study published in Nature in May.

Greenland's west coast alone is estimated to contain about 18 billion barrels of oil, according to a recent study from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. The U.S. Geological Survey has previously estimated that there may be double that volume in crude and natural gas in the east.

The island isn't banning all mineral exploration. Earlier this month, Canadian miner AEX Gold Inc. -- already the largest exploration license holder on the territory -- applied for another permit to explore for copper and gold in the south. But fossil fuels are out.

""The Greenlandic government believes that the price of oil extraction is too high,"" it said in the statement. ""This is based upon economic calculations, but considerations of the impact on climate and the environment also play a central role in the decision.""

A number of other European countries have also scrapped plans for oil exploration in recent years, including Denmark itself, France, Spain and Ireland.",tareekalshaab.com,news,Tareekalshaab -,,0.223529411764706,448895214,1,,

Scientists are tracking a massive plume of toxic gas moving across northern Europe that was spat out by the ongoing volcanic eruption in Iceland. The gas cloud is unlikely to cause any serious health problems. However, it could impact the ozone hole above the Arctic, experts warn.

On March 16, an underground volcano in Icealnd's Reykjanes Peninsula blew its top for the fourth time in as many months, opening up the largest fissure of the current eruption cycle and unleashing a massive lava flow that narrowly missed the evacuated town of Grindavík. There were initially fears that the lava flow could reach the sea and unleash a plume of hydrochloric acid, which would have been ""life-threatening"" to anyone close to the coastline, Live Science previously reported. However, the lava never reached the shore.

But the eruption did release sulfur dioxide -- a colorless, toxic gas that can be extremely dangerous in high concentrations.

On March 17, the volcano was spitting out around 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of sulfur dioxide every second, according to a translated statement from the Icelandic Met Office. Workers at the nearby Svartsengi power plant were evacuated from the facility due to high levels of the gas, Icelandic news site RÚV reported, and locals were temporarily warned to stay inside, according to Iceland's Civil Protection.

Sulfur dioxide emissions have diminished significantly since March 18, but new data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) -- part of the European Union's Copernicus program, which tracks weather and climate changes using satellite data -- shows that the initial outpouring of gas formed a 3-mile-tall (5 kilometers) concentrated column that has since blown toward other countries in northern Europe.

The gas plume has already passed above the U.K. and is currently approaching Scandinavia, where it will begin to dissipate before entering Russia.

CAMS will continue to track the plume ""although we don't expect there to be any impact on surface air quality or climate,"" senior CAMS scientist Mark Parrington said in a statement emailed to Live Science.

However, tracking sulfur dioxide emissions is still important because the gas can react with atmospheric ozone molecules, depleting the amount of this protective substance in the ozone layer, which shields Earth's surface from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

In October 2023, scientists partially attributed the near-record-largest ozone hole above Antarctica to the 2022 eruption of an underwater volcano in Tonga, which released high levels of water vapor into the atmosphere that may have depleted ozone levels.

Experts predict that the recent eruptions in Iceland could be the beginning of a new centuries-long period of activity in the region. As a result, the amount of sulfur dioxide being pumped toward the Arctic could also rise over the next few years, which could lead to larger northern ozone holes in the future.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

This was revealed by the German consultancy group VGBE Energy, which the National Treasury commissioned to analyse the performance of Eskom's coal-fired power plants and recommend ways to improve them.

The German engineers, who have extensive experience running coal-fired power plants, spent four and a half months studying South Africa's ailing power utility.

They went through Eskom's coal fleet, plant by plant, to determine what changes the utility should make to improve the performance of the individual stations.

The VGBE team also compared Eskom's plant performance to coal-fired power stations in European countries to illustrate just how poorly the utility's plants have been maintained in recent years.

The main objective of the coal fleet investigation was to find out the reasons for the coal fleet's low Energy Availability Factor (EAF), which hovers around 51%, and develop measures to improve the situation.

They identified several overarching issues, such as Eskom's complex management system, inadequate maintenance, and low staff morale, as reasons why the utility's performance has declined.

Another factor is the general incompetence and lack of ability to implement theoretical knowledge in practice.

However, the VGBE team also flagged the rising partial load losses at Eskom's coal-fired power stations as a key driver of their performance deterioration.

During the engineers' four-and-a-half-month study, partial load losses hovered around 6,000 MW. Partial load losses refer to the electricity generation capacity lost on any unit due to faults causing it to operate at less-than-optimal capacity.

The VGBE team collected data from Eskom regarding the EAF of its coal-fired power plants and their partial load losses from 2010 to the end of the 2023 financial year.

This data showed a strong correlation between the declining EAF of the coal fleet and the rise in partial load losses.

""During the site visits, it was observed that outage scopes are not completed sufficiently for a unit to return at full load,"" the VGB team said.

As a result, the magnitude of partial load losses (PLLs) has not improved after maintenance and, since 2018, has only been getting worse.

The correlation between the reduction in EAF and an increase in PLL is clearly illustrated below.",mybroadband.co.za,news,MyBroadband,Shaun Jacobs,-0.01960784313725494,448894903,1,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Eskom-logo-on-wall-cracks.jpg,

Executives attending the annual CERAWeek get-together in Houston expressed confidence that fossil fuel consumption would continue growing, just months after world leaders at the COP28 climate summit pledged to begin ""transitioning away from fossil fuels"" and triple the use of renewables by 2030.

""The environment right now is very positive for the oil and gas industry,"" Alan Armstrong, chief executive of Williams, the biggest US gas pipeline company, told the Financial Times.

""Roll the clock back four or five years ago, they were like: 'Oh, it's all going to be renewables and batteries' -- and now they're saying: 'Wow, wow, this is going to be way too expensive.'""

The bullish comments at the event -- which boasted a record attendance of more than 8,000 delegates -- came against a backdrop of record temperature rises and growing scientific concern over the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change.

The UN's World Meteorological Organization this week sounded a ""red alert"" as it affirmed 2023 as having been the hottest year on record. It pointed to unprecedented surface and ocean temperatures, glacial retreat and rising sea levels. Jim Skea, head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told an FT conference last week the world was in ""unknown territory"".

But industry leaders argue consumers are unwilling to pay the costs associated with a rapid shift to wind and solar energy. Booming construction of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres, population increases and sweeping electrification mean increases in all forms of energy, except coal, are needed to meet demand, they said.

Liam Mallon, head of ExxonMobil's upstream business, said that the ""brutal reality"" was that the world was ""not yet at a point where the big customers are willing to pay for the cost of this new energy and the consumers probably don't really know the cost of it"".

""Until such time as there is a market-based economy and everyone understands the cost of it, consumers are paying more than they need to be paying for energy -- simple, it's not that complicated,"" he said. ""You can argue green all day and NGOs all day, but those are the facts. I think that message is beginning to resonate.""

Industry heavyweight Shell last week weakened its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. BP, which dialled back its own climate targets last year, touted the potential to grow its oil and gas operations in the US's Permian Basin at the conference.

US oil and gas production have smashed fresh records in recent months and the country now pumps more than any other nation in history. Meanwhile, surging prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have propelled producers across the world to report record profits in the past two years.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and, instead, invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions,"" Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, told delegates to the conference this week.

But some renewable executives at the conference hit back at the fossil fuel narrative.

Sandhya Ganapathy, head of EDP Renewables North America, called the statements by oil and gas executives a ""limited"" view of the role renewables will play in the future.

Mark Hutchinson, chief executive of Fortescue Energy, responded to the comments from Aramco's Nasser by saying: ""The fantasy is that the oil and gas industry think that by putting more emissions in the world, it gets better.

""You have the oil and gas industry baring their teeth . . . now the world knows these guys are never going to be part of the solution.""

Yet oil and gas executives pointed to the need for dependable electricity to feed the soaring power demand sparked by the proliferation of data centres needed for AI.

The International Energy Agency anticipates global power consumption from data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt hours by 2026, more than double 2022 levels and an increase equivalent to Germany's total power use in the space of four years.

""These great things that civilisation is doing, the innovation that we're developing, depends on our industry to deliver them,"" said Toby Rice, chief executive of EQT, the biggest US natural gas producer.

""When we're talking about data centres, there's not going to be: 'Well let's do wind and let's do solar' -- this needs reliable, consistent power that can only be provided with hydrocarbons.""

Last year, the IEA predicted demand for oil and gas would peak before the end of the decade, a forecast that has been disputed by the Opec+ producers group and by many oil majors, who do not expect demand to peak until the 2030s or later.

The world is accelerating its deployment of renewables, adding 50 per cent more capacity in 2023 than the previous year, according to the IEA, with the faster growth expected in the next five years.

But the IEA faces a backlash from Big Oil and Republican supporters in the US Congress, with a group of lawmakers accusing the agency on Wednesday of adopting ""misguided and troubling"" positions on fossil fuels and straying from its core mission of promoting energy security.

A report released by Carbon Tracker this week found the world's biggest oil and gas companies still not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change, despite corporate messaging on supporting a low-carbon future.

Protesters outside the Houston event staged a mock ""funeral march"" as they blasted executives for pollution in Gulf communities and the industry's contribution to climate change.

""Our dependency on fossil fuels has been harming and killing and causing suffering for communities and people for decades,"" said James Hiatt, an activist from south-west Louisiana.

""We're at the precipice where we have got to shift if we don't want to inflict mass suffering on our children and their children.""",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,0.3568627450980393,448894897,1,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F7f178c3f-7dc6-4593-8e51-f182c7845a7d.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9409457

The world is using more oil than ever and demand is outpacing expectations again this year, raising questions about how soon global consumption will peak.

The unabated thirst for crude contributed to an increasingly confident tone from executives at this year's CERAWeek by S&P Global conference, the industry's annual get together in Houston, America's energy capital. Despite the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy, many attendees who spoke in interviews or on stage at the event this week said they expect consumption to rise for many years to come, dealing a blow to meeting goals to decarbonize the global economy.

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas,"" said Amin Nasser, the chief executive officer of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest producer. Instead we should ""invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions, as long as essential,"" he said in a speech applauded enthusiastically by attendees.

Russell Hardy, the CEO of Vitol SA, the biggest global oil trader, told the conference his firm was pushing back the estimated peak in oil consumption to the early 2030s because of downgraded expectations on the adoption of electric vehicles.

The International Energy Agency, guardian of the industrialized world's energy security, forecasts oil demand will rise 1.3 million barrels a day in 2024. While that's less than last year's jump of 2.2 million barrels, when China's emergence from Covid restrictions juiced consumption, it's still healthy by historical standards.

The agency, which has had to raise its forecasts several times, now expects daily demand to average a record 103.2 million barrels this year. It points to the strength of the US economy and the extra distance sailed by ships avoiding the Suez Canal as drivers of demand.

But many in the industry think the IEA, which expects global demand to peak before the end of the decade, is too conservative both in the short- and medium-term.

Oil trader Gunvor Group expects an increase of 1.4 million barrels a day this year. Trafigura, another global merchant, says the consensus expectation is about 1.5 million barrels, but argues there are considerable upside risks to that forecast.

""The US economy, in particular, has surprised to the upside,"" Saad Rahim, Trafigura's chief economist, said in an interview. ""Oil demand is performing better than expectations.""

The strength of consumption has helped to drive a rally in oil prices -- benchmark Brent crude oil futures have risen 11% this year, at one point trading at more than $87 a barrel.

There are areas where demand is especially robust -- the rerouting of ships away from the Red sea alone has added 100,000 barrels a day to global demand, according to Vitol. Jet fuel and plastics are also strong drivers.

India is also set to be a major contributor of additional usage. Its government expects the economy will expand 7% in the fiscal year beginning April, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies. The world's third-biggest oil importer behind China and the US, India is set to be the single largest source of global demand growth between now and 2030, according to the IEA.

""Oil demand has stayed very strong, both in the US and in other countries, both developed countries and emerging markets,"" said Helen Currie, chief economist at US oil producer ConocoPhillips. ""We're looking for another record high in world demand this year across the board.""

Until the link between economic growth and rising demand for gasoline, diesel and other oil products can be broken, a peak in crude consumption is likely to remain elusive.

The rise of EVs at the expense of internal combustion engines will be the biggest drag on oil demand in coming years, especially in China. But research from BloombergNEF forecasts EV sales growth will slow in coming years, while the total stock of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles continues to rise.

Launches sale of N500 per litre subsidised petrol to farmers

... Distributes fertiliser, others to 4,500 farmers

Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum on Friday unveiled a 90-horsepower capacity solar irrigation pump station in Damasak located in the northern part of the state.

The pumping station, with a combined 90 HP capacity, has a 115 Kilowatt solar farm powering three units of 30HP pumps, discharging 225 litres per second with 105 discharge points covering 125 hectares of rice fields.

Zulum explained that his administration was shifting its focus from continuous food distribution to empowering farming activities in the state.

""Shorter-term solution to our problems is no longer sustainable, continuous provision of food to the people and keeping of IDPs in the camp is not sustainable either. Therefore, we want to shift our focus from shorter-term humanitarian support to medium and longer-term sustainable solutions, which is agriculture.,"" Zulum said.

.. Launches sale of N500 per litre subsidised petrol to farmers

Meanwhile, Governor Zulum has launched petrol sale to farmers at a subsidised rate of N500 per litre to help boost dry season farming in the state.

The governor noted that 1 million litres of petrol product would be provided for farmers under the scheme, which would be available in all the local government areas of the state.

"" I want to announce that for this year's irrigation activities, the government of Borneo State is to procure 1 million litres of petrol and distribute it in the entire state at a subsidised rate to farmers,"" Zulum said.

He also stated,,.""In addition to this, we have procured 20,000 bags of fertiliser, 1,000 solar-powered water pumps and another 5,000 water pump machines to be distributed to farmers across the three senatorial districts of Borno.""

.. Distributes fertiliser, others to 4,500 farmers

While in Damasak, Governor Zulum also distributed fertilisers, solar and petrol-powered water pumping machines with accessories and agrochemicals for farmers in two local government areas.

The governor supervised the distribution of 4,500 bags of fertilizers, 1,000 conventional water pumps and their accessories, 9,000 litres of agrochemicals and 50 surface solar water pumps for 4,500 farmers from Mobar and Abadam Local Government Areas.

""This morning, we are flagging off the distribution of dry-season farm inputs to farmers in northern Borno. 4,500 farmers have benefited from fertilisers, agrochemicals and water-pumping machines,"" Zulum said.

He also inspected the expanded Nglayi scheme, Zanna Umarti, Dushi, Damasak Central and all other accessible farms in Damasak. The Ngalayi scheme, which was started with 500 hectares of land in 2022, has now been expanded to over 1500 hectares.

In his remarks, Borno State Commissioner for Agriculture, Engr Bawu Musami, highlighted Governor Zulum's achievements in agriculture.

Sneed, 27, is set to earn an average of $19m over four years, with $55m guaranteed and the move will be official once he has completed his medical.

The cornerback was outstanding last season as the Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl.

His standout moment was a magnificent tackle on Zay Flowers of the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth quarter of the NFL Conference Championship game, punching the ball out of his grasp as he leapt for a touchdown.

But he will now be bringing his game to Tennessee next year, and as the shockwaves started to be felt around the NFL, fans were quick to conclude it that it is a massive blow for the Chiefs.

Chiefs star L'Jarius Sneed is reportedly close to joining the Tennessee Titans in a $76m deal

Sneed was outstanding last season as Kansas City won their second straight Super Bowl

NFL fans were shocked by the move - some said it ends Chiefs hopes of a three-peat

'He was the main reason they three peat!!! It's over. The dynasty ended today. Watch in 11 months,' said one fan on X.

Another wrote: 'Chiefs got robbed in broad daylight.'

But for the fans in Tennessee, it was a landmark moment for a team that has never won a Super Bowl and missed out on the playoffs last year.

'I'm having a hard time getting some sleep after my Titans got L'Jarius Sneed in a trade from the Kansas City Chiefs. I'm excited for the 2024 season. What a free agency season for my Tennessee Titans,' wrote one Titans fan.

An Atlanta Falcons fan was stunned by the news, writing on X: 'The Chiefs trading L'Jarius Sneed should be breaking news today if you ask me. He was his own island in the Playoffs and too many WR's went missing on it.'

In the aftermath of Kansas City's win over the 49ers, Sneed was clear that he wanted a big pay packet - from the Chiefs or somewhere else.

When he made an appearance on the Up & Adams show days after the Vegas victory, he was asked if he had a message for GM Bret Veach as he approached free agency.

'Pay me,' Sneed said. 'Pay me, pay me. That's what I've got to say - pay me.'

The Titans had already signed cornerback Chidobe Aquzie during free agency.

They have also added the likes of wide receiver Calvin Ridley, center Lloyd Cushenberry and running back Tony Pollard to the roster this offseason.",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.3725490196078431,448894659,1,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/23/12/82807437-0-image-m-21_1711198063233.jpg,eng-9417289

Williams, 23, appeared in court in Crewe in relation to the 2023 crash. The footballer, who has been capped by England at Under-21 level, denies dangerous driving, did not accept responsibility for the accident, and denies he was impaired and that he had no insurance.

Magistrates have referred the footballer's case to Chester Crown Court, with a hearing date of April 19 set. WIlliams has been granted unconditional bail.

Laughing gas, also known as nitrous oxide, was banned in the UK in November 2023. Those found in possession of the substance on multiple occasions can face prison sentences, while possession alone can bring a community punishment, a caution or an unlimited fine.

""Today we are sending a clear signal to people, especially young people, that not only is abuse of nitrous oxide dangerous to their health, but it is also illegal and those caught possessing it will face consequences,"" policing minister Chris Philp said when the measures came in.

""For too long the use of this drug in public spaces has contributed to anti-social behaviour which is a blight on communities. We will not accept it. This law gives the police the powers they need to take a zero-tolerance approach to this crime.""

WIliams, who is under contract with United until the end of the 2023-24 season, last appeared in a matchday squad for them in May 2023. He was loaned out to Ipswich Town for the 2023-24 season but has not featured since December.

Williams joined Ipswich on loan for the 2023-24 season

""Kieran [Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna] was my youth-team coach at United and, from there, we have had a great relationship,"" Williams said upon moving to Portman Road. ""He has always had the standards of a coach at the top level and has had a big influence on me.

""He has always kept in touch with me to make sure I'm okay and I trust everything he says because he is great to learn off. I'm excited to work with him again.""

Ipswich sit third in the Championship table after 38 games, but just one point behind leaders Leeds United. They have an option to make Williams' move permanent come the summer.

Puram has become a popular destination for local people seeking relief from the rising temperature in the city.

Manager of the pool Anthony Louis reported a significant increase in footfall, with over 400 visitors recorded between February 15 and March 20 this year, compared to 283 during the same period last year. ""Families, young adults, and children can be seen at the pool on most mornings, especially during the weekends,"" he said.

Reopened in 2020, the pool spans dimensions of 4.5 feet in depth, 23 metres in width, and 80 metres in length.

Sharath Kesavan, a frequent visitor to the swimming pool, expressed his relief at having such a facility available during the sweltering heat. ""With the temperatures rising every day, it's a blessing to have a place like this where we can relax and have some fun in the water. It's not just about cooling off; it's also about staying active and healthy,"" he remarked.

Local authorities have responded to the increased demand by implementing safety measures such as presence of more lifeguards, enhanced sanitation protocols, and strict adherence to capacity limits. The 2024-2025 budget allocates ₹15 lakh for pool maintenance and expenses.

A senior Corporation official said, ""The allocated funds will be utilised for hiring additional lifeguards and maintaining the pool, particularly during the high-traffic summer season. Additionally, extra maintenance is necessary during the winter when the pool remains dormant.""

Further, the summer swimming classes have seen a surge in enrolment, from 40 to 60 students, indicating growing interest in structured aquatic activities. Mr. Louis anticipates further growth in enrolment by May.

Despite being allotted an exclusive hour of pool time from 8.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m., women remain limited in number and express the need for improved and extended slots. ""One hour at the beginning of office hours is insufficient. We should be allocated better time slots,"" remarked R. Gomathi, a regular pool visitor. However, the civic body asserts that due to the low turnout of women visitors, there are currently no plans to extend the timings.

Regarding access, entry fees range from ₹25 for children under seven to ₹50 for adults, covering an hour of pool time, including shower and changing facilities. Additionally, parking fees are set at ₹10 for two-wheelers and ₹20 for four-wheelers, ensuring accessibility for all visitors.

Multiple air attacks on the Russian border region of Belgorod adjoining Ukraine on Saturday killed two people and injured at least seven, the governor said.

Further east, an overnight drone attack on the Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery, the latest in a series of strikes against Russia's fuel industry.

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" Gladkov said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the facade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

In the Samara region - 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away from the front lines in eastern -- the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

The refinery, run by Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tonnes per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for over two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital Kyiv in recent days.",thenewsguru.com,news,TheNewsGuru,Emman Ovuakporie,-0.3490196078431372,448894064,1,https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fire.jpeg,eng-9419603

The government has allowed Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to export crude oil it has stored in underground strategic storages at Mangalore to give operational flexibility to the foreign firm, an order of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said on Saturday.

At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85 per cent of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

After the notification, Adnoc can now export oil stored in the Mangalore storage.",zeebiz.com,news,Zee Business,,-0.2862745098039216,448894018,1,https://cdn.zeebiz.com/sites/default/files/2024/03/23/285288-crude-oil-reuters-1.jpg,eng-9420152

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's ""huge"" state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group -- oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

""In that region, oil is cheaper than water,"" notes Rettig. ""The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.""

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

""The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,"" she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

""China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors -- in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,"" she said. ""Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.""

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first ""hydrogen society.""

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.

TORRENCE AND ENDERS RACE TO PROVISIONAL NO. 1 SPOTS AT LUCAS OIL NHRA WINTERNATIONALS","POMONA, Calif. (March 22, 2024) - Funny Car rookie Daniel Wilkerson put himself in position for his first career No. 1 qualifier on Friday, racing to the provisional top spot at the 64th annual Lucas Oil NHRA Winternationals at In-N-Out Burger Pomona Dragstrip.

Billy Torrence (Top Fuel) and Erica Enders (Pro Stock) are also the provisional No. 1 qualifiers at the second of 20 races during the 2024 NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series.

In a full-time ride for the first time in his career, Daniel Wilkerson made the most of his opportunity on Friday, taking the top spot with a 4.014 at 314.31 in his 11,000-horsepower Scag Power Equipment Ford Mustang. That puts Wilkerson in line for his first career top qualifier, which would be a huge moment in his career. He stepped into the driver role this year, with his father, Funny Car veteran Tim Wilkerson, calling the shots as crew chief. On Friday, it worked out wonderfully for the father-son duo.

""It was a little squirrely but I got it to the end,"" said Wilkerson, who will be competing for NHRA Rookie of the Year honors this year. ""It got a little loose coming out of the middle of the track and I was almost yelling at myself steering the car. But it worked out and I was happy with it. All of this, it almost hasn't set in yet, but it's been a lot of fun so far.""

Jeff Diehl took the second spot on Friday after going 4.050 at 306.81 and Chad Green, who won in Pomona last year to end the season, is third with a 4.110 at 302.96.

In Top Fuel, Billy Torrence powered to the top on Friday, going 3.745 at 330.47 in his 11,000-horsepower Capco Contractors dragster. If that holds, Torrence would earn his sixth career No. 1 qualifier, as both Torrence cars made strong runs during the lone qualifying session of the day. His son, Steve, is currently second after the four-time world champ went 3.750 at 328.30, giving the team plenty of momentum for the weekend. They also meet tomorrow in the opening round of the Mission #2Fast2Tasty NHRA Challenge.

""I was very impressed with that run,"" Torrence said. ""I thought we could make a good run on the track. The guys have worked really hard on that setup and I really thought Steve would sneak around us and pick our pocket, but he just missed us. Performance-wise, I think the cars are really close. I think we've got a good set-up for a solid year.""

Former world champ Brittany Force is in the third spot thanks to a run of 3.783 at 330.30 and Gainesville winner Shawn Langdon is right behind with a 3.788 at 318.24.

A strong start continued for reigning Pro Stock world champion Erica Enders on Friday in Pomona, as she went 6.556 at 211.69 in her Johnson's Horsepowered Garage/Melling Performance/Scag Power Equipment car. If it holds, it would give Enders her second straight No. 1 qualifier to start the season. Enders, who also won in Gainesville, is after her 50th career national event victory this weekend, which would add another incredible milestone in her stellar career. Two years ago, Enders won at the Winternationals in what was the 900th race in Pro Stock history.

""It was a little bit of a hairy ride. It made some big moves, but I'm thankful for all the runs I have in these cars,"" Enders said. ""We're big on numbers and going after that 50th win is very important to us. Winning my first Winternationals two years ago for the 900th Pro Stock race was pretty spectacular and we're glad to be back here. Coming off a win at the Gatornationals, we're just going to try to carry that momentum, but we definitely have a good racecar right now.""

Matt Hartford is currently second with a 6.568 at 210.31 and Jeg Coughlin Jr. is third with a 6.573 at 211.20.

The inflow into Indian equities stood at ₹1,539 crore and the debt market investment rose to ₹22,419 crore in February on top of the ₹19,836 crore bought in January.

The inclusion of government bonds to JPMorgan and Bloomberg debt indices especially triggered foreign fund inflows into debt markets. FPIs turned massive sellers in January 2024 snapping their buying streak as investments saw a sharp uptick in December 2023 after they reversed their three-month selling streak in November 2023.

However, inflow intensified in December on strong global cues after the US Federal Reserve signalled the end of its tightening cycle and raised expectations of a rate cut in March 2024. This led to a crash in US bond yields and triggered foreign fund inflows into emerging markets like India.

For the entire calendar year 2023, FPIs bought ₹1.71 lakh crore in Indian equities and the total inflow stands at ₹2.37 lakh crore taking into account debt, hybrid, debt-VRR, and equities, according to NSDL data. FPIs' net investment in Indian debt market stands at ₹68,663 crore during 2023.

Overall, only four months in 2023--January, February, September, and October- saw net FPI outflows from Indian equities. May, June, and July each recorded FPI inflows above ₹43,800 crore.

Newhouse spar over 'catastrophic' Snake dam agreement,"The nation's energy secretary defended a recent federal agreement on the lower Snake River dams after Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said breaching the dams would be ""catastrophic.""

He questioned Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm earlier this week at a hearing of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water.

The agreement made public in December lays the groundwork for the federal government to work with four Northwest tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington to protect and restore salmon, steelhead and other native fish to the Columbia River Basin, including the Snake River.

It also requires studies on how the benefits of the four Snake River dams in Washington could be replaced. Benefits include electricity production, barging of farm products and other goods, irrigation and recreation.

Commitments made to states and tribes in the agreement are estimated to cost the federal government more than $1 billion.

The agreement, worked out behind closed doors in federal litigation, has been called a ""roadmap"" toward breaching the dams from Ice Harbor near Pasco to Lower Granite near Lewiston, Idaho.

""The agreement makes commitments to develop energy replacement for the dams, as well as recommending spillage operations,"" Newhouse said.

Spilling more water over the dams rather than using it to produce electricity can help juvenile salmon, but too much spill increases gases -- such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen -- in the water that can kill juvenile salmon.

""Adjusting spilling operations could make the dams functionally obsolete and useless,"" Newhouse said. ""Energy prices will skyrocket, people who depend on the river system will suffer, and I believe the salmon population will be harmed, as well. It is in fact a de-facto breaching of the dams.""

Congress has the sole authority to breach the dams, Granholm said during the Wednesday hearing.

""I think the agreement was a positive step to replenish salmon, to be able to address hatcheries, to work with the tribes on additional power,"" she said.

But that's because there is not enough power being produced, rather than to replace hydropower, she said.

The agreement calls for the federal government to assist the four lower Columbia River tribes -- the Yakama, Umatilla, Nez Perce and Warm Springs -- in developing tribally sponsored clean energy projects.

Newhouse said it seems clear from the Biden administration ""that the plan is in fact breaching the dams.""

But Granholm said the agreement would prevent consideration of breaching the dams for 10 years. Although it includes a study of replacement benefits, ""There is no de facto or subterfuge here,"" she said.

Newhouse also has asked a Washington state official about the impacts of dam breaching.

He and six other Republican Northwest congressional representatives, including Washington's Cathy McMorris Rodgers, recently sent a letter to Roger Millar, Washington state secretary of transportation, asking how the state would handle increased truck and train traffic if the Snake River dams are breached.

At a January hearing of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., told Millar that about 39,200 rail cars and nearly 150,800 semi trucks a year would be needed to move cargo that currently is barged on the Snake and Columbia rivers.

That would require three times the number of heavy and tractor-trailer drivers now employed in Washington, Oregon and Idaho at a time of worker shortages in both trucking and rail, the letter said.

Now 60% of all U.S. wheat exports are barged through the lower Snake River dams, with a single four-barge tow carrying as much wheat as about 540 semi-trucks.

It is the lowest cost shipping option, according to the lawmakers signing the letter.

Without the dams to allow barging on the Snake River, the increased fuel costs, highway maintenance costs, terminal facility maintenance cost, driver pay and vehicle maintenance costs would come to $69 million a year, the letter said.

Rail costs would likely be higher as well, it said.

More than $1 billion would be needed for capital investments in highway, rail, grain elevators and other infrastructure, it said.

Capacity on highways and railroads would be at all-time high, it said.

The letter asked Millar for more information on how the Washington state Department of Transportation could continue to meet transportation needs if the lower Snake River dams are breached and how it would provide alternatives to continue to grow the Pacific Northwest economy.

Signing the letter in addition to Newhouse, McMorris Rodgers and Chavez-DeRemer, were Reps.

Russia pounded Ukraine's power facilities on Friday, striking a vast dam over the Dnipro river, killing at least five people, leaving more than a million others across seven regions without electricity, and briefly cutting off power to a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram that the ""technical possibility for electricity supply"" had been restored in most affected regions, but that the situation in the eastern Kharkiv region remained difficult.

Moscow said it unleashed its devastating aerial assault in retaliation for recent Ukrainian strikes targeting oil refineries and other energy facilities inside Russia, signalling a potential escalation of the war just days after Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85 per cent of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

German luxury brand BMW announced full-year 2023 results Thursday, highlighted by global deliveries climbing 6.4% to 2.554 million units. BMW's global revenue jumped 9% to 155.5 billion euros, with automotive EBIT margin climbing to 9.8%. In addition, BMW said EV sales jumped 74.2% to 375,000 units globally.

BMW's success with EVs, which comes amid weakening demand in the sector, could be a result of its two-pronged EV strategy, Frank Weber, the company's global chief technology officer and board member, told Yahoo Finance at a briefing with reporters on Thursday.

BMW has been releasing vehicles -- for example, the new 7-series -- in both traditional gas-powered and EV form, with both vehicles looking identical. Most other automakers' EVs appear starkly different from their gas-powered brethren, with companies basically offering different product lines.

""When I am visiting our dealerships, I am asking them, 'Is it an advantage or a disadvantage that we are offering the same vehicles with all different [gas-powered and electric] powertrains?'"" he said.

""And for us, it is really key that you find the right solution for the individual person, and I think what has helped ... [is] that we are very clear in our structure [in] that we say a 7-series is a 7-series, a 5-series is a 5-series,"" Weber said.

Weber says this structure helps customers select the car that best suits their needs. He used an example of a European customer who thinks he needs a BEV (battery electric vehicle), but ends up buying a diesel-powered car because it fills his needs better, perhaps because he needs more range or lacks access to charges.

That diversity in its powertrain options is likely helping fuel early BEV success in 2024. In the first two months of the year, BMW reported BEV sales jumped by a ""significant double-digit percentage"" compared to the same period of last year. Growth was disproportionately strong in the US, where the company's BEV sales almost doubled by the end of February compared to last year. Sales growth in Europe and China for BEV models also posted ""significant double-digit growth,"" BMW said.

Weber also touted the company's success with plug-in hybrids, yet another powertrain option available to its customers. Weber said BMW was No. 1 in plug-in hybrid sales in the premium segment, with approximately 1.1 million units sold globally. Separately, the BMW X5 xDrive50e Plug-In Hybrid SUV was named a Consumer Reports top choice in the US.

A vision of BMW's electric SUV future

BMW also unveiled a glimpse of the electric future of its SUVs Thursday, with the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X. The concept, which will closely resemble an actual model that comes out in the second half of next year, is based on BMW's bespoke EV platform dubbed Neue Klasse, which would be a split from its current dual-platform strategy.

Despite this new class of EVs being on a separate platform, technology products like infotainment and electronics will still be shared across EV and gas-powered vehicles, as it keeps costs lower and maintains product consistency. Weber acknowledged this is easier done with brands like BMW where mass-market sales volume isn't a concern.

Despite a cooling off of EV sales in the overall market, Weber is still among those who believe the EV transition is real, though it will take some time to go mainstream.

""When you look back in the last three years, we did not have a natural growth rate of this [EV] technology, and therefore what's going to happen now is not that we will abandon this technology or consumers will say it will not happen, but it is just on a more natural growth path year over year, which is something that is very healthy,"" he said.

Unfortunately, Butler and the Heat did not live up to those words and were defeated handily by New Orleans, 111-88, Friday night at the Kaseya Center.

The Miami Heat got out to one of their best starts of the season behind a strong defensive effort and a hot start from Nikola Jovic who scored eight points in the first quarter. After taking a 14-2 lead, the Pelicans decided to play zone and made Miami rely on the three as their only source of offense.

Miami took 15 threes in the first quarter and made only two, and in the blink of an eye, the Heat found themselves 21-20 after one. With no Tyler Herro or Duncan Robinson, the Pelicans lived with each Heat player hoisting threes as there was no real threat that replicate the shooting of Herro and Robinson.

The Heat managed to win games with no Herro because they had Robinson who is effective in many actions Miami runs such as the dribble hand off, back door cuts and getting to the rim when overplayed. But with both of those players out, the DHO's were completely erased and the offense resulted into a drive-and-kick machine with New Orleans packing the paint.

Although New Orleans was without Brandon Ingram and had a quiet performance from Zion Williamson who finished with only four points on seven shots, the Pelicans had floor spacers such as CJ McCollum and Trey Murphy who hurt Miami from beyond the arc. As a team, the Pelicans made 18 threes and shot 50 percent from downtown compared to the Heat who shot 27.7 percent from deep and made only 13.

With Robinson and Herro out, the Heat played Cole Swider, who actually shot well and made four triples. But Swider is still raw and is nowhere near ready to run the actions Miami puts Herro and Robinson in that puts the defense on their heels.

Until one of Herro and Robinson returns, many teams will continue to make sure Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler see multiple bodies in the paint whenever they look to attack and will crowd any screen action ran with Adebayo.

Unless the Heat can get a collective good shooting outing from a multitude of players or big performances from Butler and Adebayo, Miami is going to have to rely on getting easy buckets off of good defense and finding mismatches in transitions with their two best floor spacers out.",allucanheat.com,news,All U Can Heat,,0.0117647058823529,448891748,1,"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7193,h_4046,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/115/01hsmhjqy8pg162mzwgv.jpg",eng-9419358

But can they afford it?,"(Rick Bowmer | AP) A train transports freight on a common carrier line near Price on Thursday, July 13, 2023. The Uinta Basin Railway could be an 88-mile line in Utah that would run through tribal lands and national forest to move oil and gas to the national rail network. After a court ruled that the railroad's backers didn't properly consider the project's environmental affects last year, they've taken their fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Uinta Basin Railway, if built, is expected to triple oil experts from rural northeastern Utah by connecting the remote area to the national rail network. While opponents see the oil-moving railroad as an environmental nightmare in terms of emissions, potential oil spills and effects on wildlife, its supporters say it would transform the local economy and facilitate a domestic energy boom.

In recent months, the project has met a number of obstacles. But the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, a public partner for the Uinta Basin Railway composed of representatives from oil-rich counties in eastern Utah, isn't giving up.

On March 4, the group asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lower court's decision that the project's environmental impact statement and biological opinion were rushed and insufficient.

""Boundless [environmental] review hurts project proponents and the public too,"" the filing reads. ""The time and expense of environmental review is a barrier to all kinds of new projects -- including clean energy projects -- that prevents some of them from ever getting off the ground.""

But behind the railway's legal setbacks looms a larger question: If the project clears regulatory hurdles, who will be funding it?

""It's gotten to the point where the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition has nothing to show for its effort but failure,"" said Deeda Seed, senior campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit that challenged the Uinta Basin Railway in court.

A video on the Uinta Basin Railway website claims that the project will be ""paid for by private industry through mineral lease fees and shipments of freight on the railway."" But so far, public entities have contributed large sums to the project.

Seven County Infrastructure Coalition Executive Director Keith Heaton told a Utah Legislature appropriations subcommittee in January that the group had received approximately $28 million from the state Community Impact Board over four years, but that money was close to drying up.

The Community Impact Board, housed in the Utah Department of Workforce Services, Housing and Community Development Division, funds projects in cities and towns throughout the state impacted by development on public lands. Those cities and towns can't collect taxes on federal land, making it more difficult to provide sewer, water, transportation, health and public safety services. The Community Impact Board steps in to ease the strain, funded by federal fees returned to the state of Utah for resources developed on federal land.

Heaton, sponsored by Sen. Ron Winterton, R-Roosevelt, asked the Utah Legislature for $750,000 in one-time funding to sustain the coalition in January.

According to disclosure forms, Sen. Winterton is employed by Jones & DeMille Engineering, which has worked on the Uinta Basil Railway project.

The Legislature did not grant Heaton's request. He acknowledged the setback in a public meeting of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition last week and said that the group plans to ask the Community Impact Board for more funding.

""We often joke, but it's not a joke, that [the Community Impact Board] has been the bank of rural Utah,"" he said. ""There's limited funding there, and we certainly don't want to be pigs at the trough.""

The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition did not respond to The Salt Lake Tribune's request for comment about its recent Supreme Court filing and potential funding for the Uinta Basin Railway.

""The [Community Impact Board], exercising its sole discretion, evaluates and determines the approval of funding applications,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Workforce Services, Housing and Community Development Division told The Tribune when asked if the board was considering funding the Uinta Basin Railway project in the future.

The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition wants the highest court in the land to reverse the lower court's ruling that the project's environmental review was insufficient.

The railway's challengers argue that the Surface Transportation Board, which conducted the environmental impact statement, didn't consider how oil transported on the railway to refineries on the Gulf Coast would affect communities there.

Out of the 7,000 cases that it is asked to review yearly, the Supreme Court usually agrees to hear between 100 and 150 -- just 2% of cases.",sltrib.com,news,The Salt Lake Tribune,,0.06666666666666665,448891573,1,https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/kW_XDD-dvRu-ZrY6WieOCvceEtQ=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/5IP2YG6MARA4LJTRHR2YPTM7SQ.jpg,

New Delhi, Mar 23 (PTI) The government has allowed Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to export crude oil it has stored in underground strategic storages at Mangalore to give operational flexibility to the foreign firm, an order of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said on Saturday.

At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85 per cent of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

After the notification, Adnoc can now export oil stored in the Mangalore storage.

If you're tired of spending a small fortune on gas every month, here are some hacks from an auto mechanic that can save you money.

1. Mind Your Driving Habits

Did you know that your driving style matters? Practice coasting. EV owners have nailed this technique because they can see its impact on their range. And the same is true of gas cars. Accelerate slowly and avoid sudden stops to use less gas.

2. Keep Up With Maintenance

One of the easiest ways to save money on gas is to keep up with regular car maintenance. Don't skip an oil change. Make sure your tires are inflated to around 35 PSI. You should also check your air filter and change it every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. Be sure to replace your spark plugs if they're misfiring. These are straightforward things one mechanic shares recommends regularly checking. Doing so will help your vehicle perform optimally.

3. Choose the Right Octane Rating

The same mechanic says that most cars are designed to run on 87-octane gas. Some people believe that using 91-octane gas will improve their gas mileage, but this is not true. Stick with the manufacturer's recommendation for the best results for each car.

4. Don't Ignore the Check Engine Light

The check engine light indicates issues in your car. Even a small issue could affect your gas mileage. Don't ignore it. Instead, visit an auto store to have your car's diagnostic codes checked.

5. Embrace Cruise Control

I have never used cruise control because it freaks me out not to be manually in control of my speed. However, if you want to save gas, use cruise control, especially if you're on highways. It'll help you maintain a steady speed and reduce fuel use.

6. Be Mindful of Air Conditioning Usage

I live in Texas, so I couldn't relate to this tip. But if you live in an area where the weather is bearable, consider turning off the AC. If you're in a pinch, this can be a great way to improve your fuel efficiency.

7. Question Your GPS

This is another one that I am highly guilty of. Don't blindly follow your GPS route. I like to stick my destination in Apple Maps and study it beforehand, especially on long road trips. You might find shortcuts that can shave off 50-100 miles from your journey if traveling far. Not only that, but many apps have eco-friendly settings you can select that will show you how much fuel you'll save compared to other routes.

8. Skip Gas Additives

Many people swear by the additives in gas to increase fuel efficiency, but the hard truth is that these additives are not worth it. The tiny sliver of fuel efficiency will not be worth the cost of the additives.

9. Hybrid Owners Use Eco-Boost

If you drive a hybrid, use the EcoBoost setting. You may be surprised to see just how much gas you can save by doing this. Hybrid cars are specifically designed to help owners save on gas. So, if you have the EcoBoost button, use it.

10. Consider a Gas Credit Card

My husband and I have a credit card for our favorite gas station, and they give us 15% cash back on our gas costs. Many major gas stations offer rewards programs where you can save an easy five cents per gallon every time you fill up. Just be mindful of that APR and minimum monthly payments so you're not paying more for your gas purchases in the long run.

11. Join Cashback Apps for Gas Stations

I joined so many money-saving apps over the years. GasBuddy helps you to find the best-priced gas stations near you, and Upside is another app that pays out cash rewards based on the amount of gas you buy and which station you purchase it from. Each gas station will have different cashback percentages offered to customers.

This is my favorite tip because I am a homebody. The absolute best way to save money on gas is to drive less. Run errands and get everything you need in one trip. Try to find someone to carpool with to work. Let your kids take the bus to school. Have groceries delivered to your home. There are endless ways that you can drive less.",goodmenproject.com,news,The Good Men Project,Wealth Of Geeks,0.01960784313725483,448891508,1,https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/refueling-car.jpg,

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

For the game, New Orleans shot 51.2 percent, including 18-of-36 on 3-pointers.

Miami shot 36 percent, including 13-of-47 on 3-pointers (27.7 percent).",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.1529411764705881,448891128,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/flm1711162501.jpg,

A scrappy group of filmmakers and activists think it can also be funny.

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humor to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

In recent years, research has shown that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from distribution infrastructure and other sources. A 2022 Harvard study also found that natural gas used in homes contains hazardous pollutants.

Called ""Hot & Toxic,"" the campaign's trailer is a riff on a reality television show in which 21 irritating housemates symbolizing pollutants associated with natural gas descend on an unsuspecting homeowner. The message is clear: Using natural gas inside your home is not safe.

""I did not come here to make friends,"" the actor playing Carbon Monoxide, or C.Mo, says directly to the camera as if being interviewed.

""I came here to cause chest pain, nausea and vomiting.""

In addition to the trailer, the campaign includes social media content and billboards in Los Angeles and Washington. It is sponsored by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises and manages charitable giving.

""We really took a lot of care to design it in the most engaging way possible so it feels like a reality TV show,"" James Hadgis, a filmmaker who was tapped to run the Gas Leaks Project as its executive director, said in an interview. ""I hope it brings people in to want to watch it and make it fun and funny and click to learn more.""

Asked to comment on the campaign, the American Gas Association trade group said natural gas is fundamental to energy security, economic prosperity and achieving the nation's environmental goals.

""Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,"" AGA President Karen Harbert said in a statement.

Though the campaign is kicking off with warnings about the public health impacts of natural gas, Hadgis said he is eager to produce more content focused on climate.

Gas Leaks Project was created by a coalition of firms focused on climate communications, including Fossil Free Media, Energy Media, Sunstone Strategies and Climate Nexus.

""A lot of climate messaging is really boring,"" said Jamie Henn, founder of Fossil Free Media. ""We need to be out there talking to people a little less like their science teachers and a little more like their best friends.""

He posted a photo of a residential building with the façade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

Further east, in the Samara region - 620 miles away from the front lines in eastern Ukraine - the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a major fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, Dmitry Azarov, the governor of Samara, said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

Ukraine said on Friday that Russian oil refineries were legitimate targets, despite reports that the US has been warning it to halt drone strikes amid fears they could hinder Joe Biden's re-election chances.

There have been at least nine attacks on major Russian refineries this year, which have caused crude oil prices to jump in recent weeks.

The refinery, run by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tons per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Mr Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for more than two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

And Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital, Kyiv, in recent days.",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,,-0.5450980392156863,448889888,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t.fhM4GjvVQwrAK5KWNG2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/4493f091d76f200192cdc53af620741e,

Ukraine suffered a second day of intense bombing of its power stations plunging half a dozen regions into darkness, as the Kremlin tries to take advantage of Kyiv's dwindling supply of air defence ammo.

At the same time the US asked Zelenskiy's administration to curb its long distance drone strikes on Russia's oil refineries as production dropped by 10% since the start of the year, threatening an oil product price strike ahead of US elections slated for this November.

Missile barrage

On the night of March 21-22, Russian troops launched a combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine's critical infrastructure using a total of 151 aerial weapons that cost well over $300mn, according to reports.

Ukrainian air defence units managed to destroy 92 Russian aerial targets, but an increasing number of Russian missiles are getting through to hit their targets as Ukraine starts to run low on air defence ammo. Blackouts not seen for about a year are back as important power plants were struck and suffered major damage.

Emergency power outages are taking place in a number of Ukrainian regions after reports of damage to power generating facilities, the Ukrainian energy holding DTEK and regional authorities reported.

Blackouts have been reported in eight regions, including the Dnipro Region and in the Kyiv-controlled areas of the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as ""stabilization outages"" in the Odessa Region.

According to the regional authorities, over 110,000 residents of the Poltava Region will be disconnected ""to balance the power grid,"" while in the Sumy Region, emergency cut-off plans will be implemented in several districts.

It appears that the Kremlin is trying to take advantage of Kyiv's increasingly dire financial state after the US ran out of money for Ukraine in January and halted supplies of badly needed weapons and ammo. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Western leaders last week to urgently send more munitions, but the Ministry of Finance (MinFin) admitted last week that Ukraine has only received 10% of the arms and cash promised last month at the 20 Ramstein meeting.

The barrage began on March 21, hitting cities across the country. A Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia on March 22 claimed the lives of three people: a father and daughter aged 35 and 8, and a 62-year-old trolleybus driver who was driving along the dam of the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Kyiv Independent reports.

The target was the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant, a major source of power, that was struck by eight missiles and suffered extensive damage.

Ukraine's power station targeted

Ukraine is currently suffering from the most intense missile and drone attack since the start of the war more than two years ago -- even more intense than the first barrage launched in January designed to run Ukrainian's stock of defensive missiles down; a tactic that now seems to be paying dividends for Russia.

Russian forces are exploiting Ukraine's air defence shortages to plunge the country into darkness and destroy the country's energy grid in the largest strike since the start of the conflict, according to a report from Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

More than 130 energy infrastructure facilities have been targeted across the country over the last two days. The Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant is the largest facility in Ukraine and was a key target, but dozens of other power stations have also been hit and damaged, according to reports.

The Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant is now reported to be in a critical condition after its turbine room and electrical equipment were seriously damaged, director Igor Sirota reportedly said.

""We are losing the station. The HPP-2 is in danger. We don't know at what capacity it will be able to operate. The HPP-2 is in critical condition. The HPP-1 has also stopped operations, so we are doing everything we can to raise the gates and process the water,"" Ukraine's Strana media outlet quoted him as saying.

""We will have to fully rebuild the turbine room and repair electrical equipment,"" he added, noting that there was no threat of a dam break.

The current onslaught has sent residents of cities around Ukraine scuttling back into air raid shelters that haven't been much used since the last assault on Ukraine's power infrastructure in the winter of 2022.

The US and European provided air defences have proven so effective that bne IntelliNews correspondent in Kyiv report the locals had become increasingly blasé about air raid siren alerts, often choosing to ignore them and continue going about their routines. But that has changed dramatically in the last days as the combination of falling levels of ammo and the sheer intensity of the attack have driven people underground again.

The skies are open again to a Russian assault that threatens to repeat the destruction of half the country's energy infrastructure as occurred in the winter 2022 campaign. The Washington Post recently reported that the shortage of air defence ammo has become so acute that Kyiv may soon be limited to only being able to shoot down one in five inbound missiles.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early Spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the ISW said.

With international supplies of weapons falling off, Ukraine's strategy is to become a military production hub and make more of the arms and ammo it needs at home. Depriving Ukraine of power will make that task a lot harder.

US calls on Ukraine to halt oil refinery attacks

Ukraine launched a counter punch in February that is also designed to run down Russia's ability to supply its forces and earn money to run its war machine by targeting Russia's oil refineries with long range missiles.

However, the Financial Times reported last week that the US has urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, warning senior SBU and GUR officials that drone strikes risk driving up global oil prices and provoking retaliation.

Russia crude oil refining production has dropped to a ten-month low and is down to 5mbpd from March 14-20, or a 10% fall y/y. after Ukraine began a drone war in February, using new long-range domestically produced drones to attack Russia's refining capacity deep inside Russian territory.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak denied that Washington had called on Kyiv to halt the drone strikes on Russian assets.

""This is fictitious information. After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for waging this war. Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of warfare. Fuel is the basic tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy its fuel infrastructure,"" Podolyak said as cited by Ukrayinska Pravda.

Podolyak argued that Russia is in the midst of a major attack against Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure with genocidal intentions, while Ukraine has responded with its own attacks against the Russian infrastructure of war.

Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, followed up saying that Russia's oil refineries are ""legitimate targets of Ukraine from a military point of view."" According to her, Ukraine is acting in accordance with Nato standards in this case, in statements that defy the US concerns.

""We understand the requests of American partners. But we wage war with the capabilities, resources and practices that are available to us,"" she said during the second Ukrainian Security Forum.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on his Nato allies to ""close the skies"" from the very first week of the war, but Nato has never responded leaving Ukraine vulnerable to missile attacks. The supply of sophisticated anti-missile systems, and the US-made Patriot system in particular - have alleviated the problem somewhat, but the Patriot missiles are expensive and in short supply, whereas Russia has ramped up the production of cheap weaponized drones that it is firing at Ukraine in their droves.

Commenting on the hostile attack by the Russians on March 22, Stefanishyna welcomed the words of support from Ukraine's western allies, but words alone are insufficient, given the scale and intensity of the current attack.

""I want to draw attention to the fact that the situation is already very bad... Over the past two months, we have received 10% of the planned financial resources necessary for the survival of the state, and also have not received military assistance, which was planned for almost a year within the Ramstein format by more than 50 countries around the world,"" Stefanishyna said. ""Reaction is one thing, but we expect weapons first of all.""",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.5058823529411764,448889881,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Ukraine_industry_factory_energy_power_station_electricity_business_0.jpeg,eng-9416762

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.",reformer.com,news,Brattleboro Reformer,"Associated Press, Heather Hollingsworth",-0.05882352941176472,448889856,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/7b/27bac941-e675-5b0e-ba1f-48b9ffe706a7/65febb7ff31f6.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"FILE - A total solar eclipse is seen above the Bald Knob Cross of Peace Monday, Aug. 21, 2017, in Alto Pass, Ill. Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's 2024 total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

Featured Local Savings

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

According to sources, Sinha, who was approximately 90 kilometres away at the ancestral residence in Murarai in the same district, however, returned to his home as soon as he heard about the news of the raid. Sinha's two sons and wife were also questioned by the ED. The raid continued for over nine hours.

CBI raids TMC leader Mahua Moitra's residence

Earlier in the day, the Central Bureau of Investigation conducted raids at Trinamool Congress leader and former Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra's house in the cash for query case. The CBI filed a formal complaint (FIR) against her on 21st March following orders from Lokpal, the anti-corruption ombudsman. The Lokpal had given the agency directions after examining the results of the CBI's preliminary investigation into the accusations made against her by BJP Lok Sabha member Nishikant Dubey. The Lokpal granted the CBI six months to thoroughly look into every aspect of the complaints made against her.

Mahua Moitra was expelled by the Lok Sabha on 8th December 8th in accordance with the Ethics Committee's recommendations in a cash-for-query case. The development transpired hours after the Ethics Committee report was presented to the lower house.

Nishkant Dubey wrote to the ethics committee, requesting an investigation into Mahua Moitra on the ""cash for query"" controversy. He based his complaint on a letter from Supreme Court attorney Jai Anant Dehadrai, who said that businessman Darshan Hiranandani benefited directly or indirectly from the majority of the questions posed by the TMC MP in the Lok Sabha. An additional layer of intrigue to the matter was created when Jai Ananad Dehadrai accused Mahua of ""kidnapping"" his pet dog ""Henry"" which was eventually returned.",opindia.com,news,OpIndia,,-0.1843137254901961,448889234,1,https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-700x400-1-1-1.jpg,eng-9416974

On 22 March, Russia launched one of the largest attacks on Ukraine, using 151 aerial attack weapons: 63 strike UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type, 12 Iskander-M ballistic missiles, 40 Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles, 5 Kh-22 cruise missiles, 7 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal aeroballistic missiles, 2 Kh-59 guided aircraft missiles, 22 S-300/S-400 anti-aircraft guided missiles.

The main target was Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Dozens of energy system facilities were damaged. The terrorist state launched a missile strike on the Dnipro hydroelectric power station. Two direct hits hit HPP-1 and HPP-2. As a result of the strike a large-scale leakage of oil products into the Dnieper River occurred. The dam remained intact, although it was damaged. 80 years ago, the Dnieper hydroelectric power station was blown up by the Nazis Wehrmacht.

Seven regions of the country experienced emergency power cuts and implemented stabilisation shutdown schedules, which Ukraine has not seen since the end of last winter. In Kharkiv, the metro, railway station and a large part of the city were de-energised. In Dnipropetrovsk Region, hundreds of miners were blocked due to power cuts and could not get to the surface.

Russia also continued to carry out systematic air strikes on frontline and border territories, wiping out Ukrainian residential areas. Ukraine's densely populated cities - Zaporizhzhya, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kyiv - were subjected to massive attacks with long range missiles. The victims of these attacks were civilians.

The creation of a deeply echeloned air defence system around each major Ukrainian city could save the lives of Ukrainian civilians and preserve critical infrastructure. Western air defence systems such as Patriot, SAMP(T), IRIS-T have already proven their effectiveness in destroying various types of Russian missiles.

Every day the Moscow terrorist regime kills Ukrainian men and women. This conveyor belt of death, arranged and directed by the Kremlin, will continue until Russia is stopped.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod, wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region, which borders Ukraine, as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Mr Gladkov said.

Two people had been killed and at least seven injured, the governor said.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" he said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the façade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

Further east, in the Samara region - 620 miles away from the front lines in eastern Ukraine - the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a major fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, Dmitry Azarov, the governor of Samara, said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

Ukraine said on Friday that Russian oil refineries were legitimate targets, despite reports that the US has been warning it to halt drone strikes amid fears they could hinder Joe Biden's re-election chances.

There have been at least nine attacks on major Russian refineries this year, which have caused crude oil prices to jump in recent weeks.

The refinery, run by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tons per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Mr Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fired at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for more than two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

And Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital, Kyiv, in recent days.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.5450980392156863,448888901,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t.fhM4GjvVQwrAK5KWNG2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/4493f091d76f200192cdc53af620741e,

These companies receive gas from public sector exploration and production (E&P) firms but are not paying them back, reported a national daily.

Both companies are using expensive RLNG (Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas) without reimbursing Pakistan State Oil (PSO).

The audit, to be completed within a month, will be handled by KPMG. It will investigate the reasons behind the gas utilities' failure to pay back E&P companies and PSO. KPMG will also examine the revenue of gas companies, government subsidies, and gas prices set by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority.

The audit is expected to help determine the impact of recent gas price hikes and whether the Sui companies have paid dues to E&P firms like OGDCL, GHPL, and PPL. The outstanding payments to these E&P companies have reached Rs. 1.732 trillion.

The financial audit will also shed light on why the circular debt in the gas sector has reached Rs. 2.9 trillion.

Work is underway south of Winnipeg on a section of pipeline that brings fuel to the city.

Imperial Oil Ltd. announced last weekend that the line was shut down after an inspection raised concerns about a section of the pipe under the Red River just south of St. Adolphe, Man.

""Some work is happening right now, some engineering and geotechnical work, some equipment's going to start arriving at site later this week,"" said Keri Scobie, who is part of public and government affairs with Imperial Oil. ""The drilling work we're looking to undertake starting near the end of April.""

The company previously said the line, which carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, will be out of service for approximately three months.

Scobie said Imperial's goal is to create the least disruption possible as the work gets underway.

""We're working very closely with our neighbours to let them know about the maintenance work, the time frame, all of those sorts of things,"" she said. ""We're going to keep in close contact with everybody that lives close by.""

Brian Labelle lives in the area said so far, he hasn't noticed any disruptions because of the work.

""So far I haven't heard a sound, it's pretty quiet and we're right on the south end of town,"" he said.

Labelle also said he doesn't think the noise will make much of a difference when the drilling starts toward the end of next month.

""There's a lot of construction going on with the home construction in the new area south here, so you hear a lot of noise of trucks and hammering and noises,"" he said.

""You'd be surprised, there's a lot of trucks coming down ... here going to Niverville, tons of traffic,"" Labelle also said.

The rural municipality of Ritchot waived its noise bylaw so Imperial can work 24 hours a day when the drilling begins.

Ritchot chief administrative officer Mitch Duval said the machines can emit sounds ranging from 85 to 100 decibels, which he compared to a large commercial mower.

Meanwhile, Scobie said the company will also have the environment at the forefront during the repair.

""I think anytime we undertake a project like this ... the environment is something that is top of mind for us,"" she said.

It was hot, dirty work and the steel came out of the furnace over asbestos-covered rollers, leaving Dad working in a cloud of the stuff.

In 2006, Dad was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an insanely painful and ultimately 100% deadly disease. I tracked down a lawyer who did suits on behalf of asbestos victims, and he showed up to depose Dad on videotape along with more than a dozen asbestos industry lawyers, several of whom were quite verbally abusive to Dad. They barely fit into my parent's small living room and left my father in tears.

After the lawyers' fees, I think Mom ended up with around $135,000, which was better than nothing, although the industry lawyers had filed an appeal that forced him back to the hospital for a painful second biopsy to ""prove"" he had mesothelioma. And then they procrastinated so long that the money didn't come until after he'd died. These were Trump-style-relentless lawyers representing a murderous industry that had known since the 1930s that their product caused this exact disease.

Every senior executive in the industry for the more-than-70 years between the time they discovered how deadly asbestos was and my Dad's death knew. And participated in the cover-up.

Just like the executives in the tobacco industry, who have known with certainty that they were peddling death and disease since the 1940s and are today responsible for an estimated half-million American deaths every year, including my younger brother Stan who died of COPD last year.

""Psychopath"" is the only word that adequately describes these executives, their decision-making employees, and their hired-gun marketers who make millions knowingly selling poisons.

And now comes the fossil fuel industry, with a whole new crop of psychopathic executives, marketers, and attorneys. Burning their products produces air pollution that causes asthma, cancer, heart disease, and strokes; according to Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Medicine, an estimated 350,000 Americans die prematurely every year because of this industry's products.

And that doesn't scratch the surface of the death and destruction on the horizon, as severe weather driven by global warming from fossil fuel emissions kick in. Such events have cost America over $2 trillion and more than 16,000 lives just since Ronald Reagan began denying the science in 1980. Over 60,000 people died in Europe just last year from a series of severe heatwaves.

A new study from the international NGO Global Witness documents how there could be 11.5 million excess deaths from global warming worldwide by 2100 just based on the emissions of five companies between now and 26 years from now: Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, and Chevron.

And now we learned that the industry, which has been publicly praising the Paris Accords around reducing emissions and getting climate change under control, have been lying to us again and instead are -- across the board -- increasing their production of their toxic products.

This and other analyses of the death and destruction wrought by the fossil fuel industry's carbon pollution have led a number of legal experts to suggest that now may be the time to lay the foundation for the prosecution of fossil fuel companies and their executives for murder or, at the least, manslaughter.

This would not be a new or novel event.

California utility PG&E was convicted of multiple manslaughter counts and paid $3.5 million in fines when their decision to use money that could have upgraded or buried their power lines -- but instead went to millions in bonuses and stock buy-backs for their senior executives -- led to the death of 85 people in the Camp Fire that consumed the town of Paradise.

Similarly, when BP's failure to properly use and maintain their blowout preventers led to 11 deaths (and a massive oil spill) in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, that company pleaded guilty to manslaughter. BP and PG&E ultimately paid billions in fines and compensation.

A new analysis published in the Harvard Environmental Law Review (Vol. 48, No. 1, 2024) titled Climate Homicide: Prosecuting Big Oil For Climate Deaths lays out the case for holding fossil fuel industry executives and their companies accountable for the deaths they are causing as you read these words.

""For decades,"" the authors write, ""fossil fuel companies ('FFCs') have known that their product causes 'globally catastrophic' climate change. Rather than warn the public or alter their business models, they waged a multi-decade disinformation campaign to sow doubt and delay regulatory responses.

""Today, as experts continue developing and delivering ever more detailed and precise warnings of climate catastrophe, and vast numbers of people are killed at an accelerating rate by wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other climate-related calamities, FFCs continue to expand the production, marketing, and sale of the products they have long understood to cause mass death.

""Activists and journalists have called executives of major oil companies 'mass murderers,' lamenting that 'millions of human beings will die so that they can have private planes and huge mansions,' and a growing chorus of communities devastated by FFCs' lethal conduct have begun to demand accountability.""

The authors are blunt, arguing that these executives and their companies are knowingly complicit in the deaths of millions of people in America and around the world, with the numbers starting to explode as we cross multiple climate tipping points.

And still, like the asbestos and tobacco executives of the last century, instead of mitigating the harms of their products, they instead fight every effort at transparency or accountability.

""As additional evidence of FFCs' knowledge of the lethal risks they were generating surfaces through leaks and court-mandated discovery, obstacles to a successful prosecution [for murder or manslaughter] are falling away. At the same time, with every new wave of climate-related deaths, the justification for prosecution grows.

""Although some of the harmful externalities that FFCs generate may be suitable for tort or regulatory suits, the lethality of FFCs' conduct, their awareness of the risks they are generating, and their efforts to obscure those risks make criminal prosecution for homicide particularly appropriate.

""Perhaps most importantly, if FFCs continue to fight against all major efforts to reduce the harms they are generating, and if they continue to obstruct or delay state and federal regulation and civil suits designed to reduce the lethal impact of their conduct, then homicide prosecutions may prove necessary to prevent the escalating threat that their lethal conduct poses to millions of potential victims in the United States.""

Indeed, at a conference in Houston this week, Saudi Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, was explicit with a comment that drew loud applause from his oil industry audience:

""We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately.""

Similarly, Fortune magazine reported last month that the fossil fuel industry is positioning itself to be the largest donor to the Trump campaign, having already given him over $7 million following his recent promises to ""drill, baby, drill"" and to end all subsidies for electric vehicles and solar or wind power projects.

""Californians should be wise enough to see this messaging for what it is: The behavior of a threatened, greed-driven industry trying to trick us into letting it hold onto its dirty and harmful old ways of doing business.""

This denial of the crisis and doubling down on advertising and more emissions is, of course, no solution.

In past articles here on Hartmann Report, I've argued for the US government to nationalize the three largest American fossil fuel companies by purchasing their stock in the marketplace; the total cost would be less than the Trump tax cuts for billionaires, and with new management the companies could help our nation's transition away from its addiction to oil, coal, and natural gas.

Today there are families all across the country who are mourning the loss of their loved ones to climate-change-fueled floods, heatstroke, and violent weather as much as I grieved my father's death at the hands of the asbestos industry executives.

They deserve justice, and the industry needs a wake-up call like the asbestos industry got in the late 1990s, leading to a wave of bankruptcies.

Holding murderous executives and their rogue companies bent on profiting from unnecessary death and destruction is imperative. As New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin noted a few months ago:

""Based on their own research, these companies understood decades ago that their products were causing climate change and would have devastating environmental impacts down the road.

""They went to great lengths to hide the truth and mislead the people of New Jersey and the world. In short, these companies put their profits ahead of our safety. It's long overdue that the facts be aired in a New Jersey court and the perpetrators of the disinformation campaign pay for the harms they've caused.""

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

FILE - Workers inspect solar panels at the fishing-solar complementary photovoltaic power generation base in Taizhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, July 12, 2023.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first 'hydrogen society.'

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.3647058823529412,448887793,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711186601.jpg,

LOS ANGELES -- As global warming raises temperatures, a California work safety board has approved standards that would require companies to protect employees from excessive indoor heat, particularly in warehouses. The rules still need to overcome opposition by another state agency.

The rules were approved Thursday by the board of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, commonly known as Cal/OSHA, despite a late objection from the state Department of Finance because of cost effects on the state, the Los Angeles Times reported.

There is no federal heat standard in the United States. California has had heat protection rules for outdoor work such as agriculture and construction since 2006. But tackling indoor heat protections has taken years since the state passed legislation in 2016 to draft standards for indoor workers.

The proposed regulations would apply to workplaces ranging from warehouses to schools and kitchens, requiring cooling devices, access to water and cooling-off break areas at certain temperature thresholds as well as monitoring for signs of heat illness.

Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, applauded the vote and said 15 million workers in the state stand to benefit.

""The hottest years on record have occurred in the last ten years. That means the danger of working in high heat has become more acute in the time it has taken to finalize these standards,"" Kaoosji said in a statement.

California experienced an e-commerce-driven boom in the construction of massive warehouses for companies such as Amazon. Concerns about heat illnesses have been repeatedly raised by workers in the industry.

Amazon said in a statement that its heat safety protocols often exceed industry standards, and it provides air conditioning in all of its fulfillment centers and air hubs.

The Department of Finance sought to halt the Cal/OSHA board's vote, citing concerns about huge costs to correctional and other facilities.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, told the Times the impact ""could be in the neighborhood of billions of dollars.""

The state Office of Administrative Law will need the Department of Finance's approval before it can move forward with the regulations, Palmer said.

Palmer also said the Department of Finance only received some of the data involving the regulations in February.

""This was a decision that was driven by our inability to do our fiscal due diligence and evaluate this data late in the process that had a potential impact to the state,"" he said.

Labor and climate activists opposed the effort to remove the heat-protection item from Thursday's meeting agenda, and board Chair David Thomas agreed.

""There's no reason this shouldn't be passed in my mind, because they are right that their lives are the ones that are on the line,"" Thomas said.

Man United loanee Brandon Williams inhaled laughing gas before getting involved in a high-speed car crash, it was claimed in a court on Friday.

The full-back, who is currently on loan with Championship side Ipswich, faced Magistrates over the accident which happened last year.

According to the Sun, prosecutor Katie Johnson said he was involved in an accident at a speed of 74mph after driving his Audi A3 S Line at high speeds along the A34 in Wilmslow, Cheshire.

Ms Johnson said: 'He was seen by witnesses to have taken nitrous oxide from balloons.'

Nitrous oxide was made a controlled Class C drug back in November, meaning it is now an offence if a person intends to wrongfully inhale it for a psychoactive effect.

The clerk to the court said that Williams denied dangerous driving and did not accept he was responsible for the accident.

According to the outlet, the young defender appeared in the dock in Crewe dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and dark tie.

Magistrates sent the case for trial at Chester Crown Court with a hearing on April 19. Williams was also granted unconditional bail.

At $3.53 per gallon nationwide, they are above the prices last week, a month ago, and a year ago. The same holds for Premium, which has reached $4.31.

Regular gas prices are nowhere near the $5 level they hit in June 2022, when supplies were interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, crude oil prices topped $100.

Crude prices affect gas prices more than any other factor. Today, crude costs $81 per barrel, up from $70 in mid-January. Part of this rise is due to tightened supply, and other reasons are geopolitical.

The Gaza-Israel conflict started in October and has made oil traders nervous. Conflict in the Middle East region has severely interrupted oil supplies before. Elsewhere, Ukraine has used drones that target Russian refineries. Russia is among the world's largest oil producers.

The most important geopolitical issue is a battle between Houthi rebels and US and allied military forces in the Red Sea. One rocket fired by the rebels has already sunk a cargo ship. The path through the Red Sea leads toward the Suez Canal. The rebels continue to fire on ships, damaging some.

About 15% of shipping traffic goes through the Suez Canal, probably higher for oil tankers. By some estimates, Houthi attacks have cut this traffic by more than 40%. Ships have been forced to travel south of the Cape of Good Hope to reach ports in Asia, which can add ten days to their trips. While this may not add much to the cost of crude worldwide, it can raise the price in parts of Asia. The change in shipping patterns also reflects worry that the Red Sea conflict could explode into region-wide military activity. That could interrupt supply substantially.

At this point, there is little reason for oil prices, and therefore gas prices, to fall. On the other hand, there are several reasons for an increase.",247wallst.com,news,24/7 Wall St.,Douglas A.

When environmentalists talk about climate change, it's typically in stark terms, describing it as a crisis that threatens the future of the planet. A scrappy group of filmmakers and activists think it can also be funny.

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humor to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

Photo and video,"On the night of March 23, the Novokuibyshevsky refinery caught fire in the Samara region of Russia. Locals said that they heard the sounds of drones before the fire and that there were two explosions.

The alleged attack on the facility was reported by Russian Telegram channels. The footage posted on the network shows that the structures are engulfed in heavy fire and smoke is billowing.

Novokuibyshevsky refinery is one of the main producers and suppliers of top-grade RT jet fuel, the most popular fuel in Russia. The enterprise with an annual capacity of 8.8 million tons of oil belongs to Rosneft. It produces fuels for all types of transport: automotive, aviation, rail, river and sea vessels, lubricant components, bitumen, coke, and petrochemical products.

Interestingly, this is the second attack on this plant in a week. On March 16, it and the Syzran oil refinery were also attacked by drones. Fires broke out.

Earlier, the British newspaper Financial Times reported that the United States called on Ukraine to stop attacks on Russian energy facilities. This warning is allegedly motivated by the fact that drone strikes could lead to higher oil prices in the world and provoke Moscow's revenge.

It was also reported that the White House has neither confirmed nor denied the information that the United States allegedly asked Ukrainian special services to stop strikes on Russian oil refineries.

A scrappy group of filmmakers and activists think it can also be funny.

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humor to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

In recent years, research has shown that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from distribution infrastructure and other sources. A 2022 Harvard study also found that natural gas used in homes contains hazardous pollutants.

Called ""Hot & Toxic,"" the campaign's trailer is a riff on a reality television show in which 21 irritating housemates symbolizing pollutants associated with natural gas descend on an unsuspecting homeowner. The message is clear: Using natural gas inside your home is not safe.

""I did not come here to make friends,"" the actor playing Carbon Monoxide, or C.Mo, says directly to the camera as if being interviewed.

""I came here to cause chest pain, nausea and vomiting.""

In addition to the trailer, the campaign includes social media content and billboards in Los Angeles and Washington. It is sponsored by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises and manages charitable giving.

""We really took a lot of care to design it in the most engaging way possible so it feels like a reality TV show,"" James Hadgis, a filmmaker who was tapped to run the Gas Leaks Project as its executive director, said in an interview. ""I hope it brings people in to want to watch it and make it fun and funny and click to learn more.""

Asked to comment on the campaign, the American Gas Association trade group said natural gas is fundamental to energy security, economic prosperity and achieving the nation's environmental goals.

""Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,"" AGA President Karen Harbert said in a statement.

Though the campaign is kicking off with warnings about the public health impacts of natural gas, Hadgis said he is eager to produce more content focused on climate.

Gas Leaks Project was created by a coalition of firms focused on climate communications, including Fossil Free Media, Energy Media, Sunstone Strategies and Climate Nexus.

""A lot of climate messaging is really boring,"" said Jamie Henn, founder of Fossil Free Media. ""We need to be out there talking to people a little less like their science teachers and a little more like their best friends.""

While it might be a small discount, it's worth mentioning that this is a vastly loved hair oil on the shopping site - with more than 1,500 top ratings. More than 10,000 purchases of the hair oil have been made in the past month alone.

The oil, made by Mielle Organics, helps hair growth with some fans saying it 'doubled' the growth of their hair. It features more than 30 essential oils and is ideal for daily use.

One shopper said: ""Smells like mint and tea trees. So fresh and clean. Easy to use, suitable for hair growth, hair growth has doubled since using. It used to take me a year to grow three inches; now, I get my hair trimmed at all my appointments. I bleached my hair, and it became damaged; I credit this with helping it feel soft and healthy again. I will purchase this again.""

Another added: ""To be honest I was reluctant to buy this product as I didn't want my hair to get oily, but to be honest is absolutely amazing, not only I have healthy hair but is so soft, less hair falling off and only using once a week.""

And a third said: ""Of course after seeing all the tiktoks about rosemary oil and hair growth - I had to buy. This was the first brand I tried and I've tried multiple since then but have come back to this as my hair has gone back to being greasy since stopping it. Wish they did a larger bottle though.""

However one buyer said: ""I was very happy with my first bottle, it smelt minty and was a good, thick consistency. My scalp was tingly when I applied it, which suggested it might be doing something. The second time I purchased, it was a weaker consistency, didn't smell of much at all and no reaction on my skin. I feel like the product has changed and it's put me off ordering again.""

Researchers with the organization scored major fossil fuel companies on five metrics, including investment options, production plans, sanctions on recent products, incentives for remuneration and emissions reduction targets. In each category, the companies scored between 0 and 4, with 4 representing the closest alignment.

They assigned each company a grade of A through H, with A representing the closest to full alignment with Paris goals of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and H representing a strategy aligned with 2.4 degrees or more.

The report found the company most aligned with Paris goals was BP, which still received a grade of D-, while ConocoPhillips scored an H, the only company to receive the lowest grade. Of the five bottom scorers, three - ConocoPhillips, Pioneer and ExxonMobil - are based in the U.S.

Scores were particularly out of alignment with Paris when it came to emissions targets. None of the 25 companies scored a 4 on this metric and only one, Italian oil company Eni, scored a 3. The majority of companies - 16 - scored a zero on emissions reductions.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris Agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" report author Maeve O'Connor said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies.""

The report comes months after the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where despite widespread criticism of an oil executive as head of the summit, attendees reached an agreement to begin the transition away from fossil fuels for the first time in the summit's history.

A: It was interesting how the discourse after Friday night's loss to the Pelicans included talk about the sputtering 3-point game as well as not getting the ball where it should have gone. To me, this brings the Heat back to the 2021 offseason, when the decision was made to go for a true point guard and make the trade for Kyle Lowry. Granted, it did not end well for the Heat with Kyle, but there at least was the acknowledgement of the need for a classic distributor. Now, with Terry Rozier more of a scoring guard than passing guard, the Heat again are attempting to play point guard by committee. They certainly have plenty of capable ball handlers. But when it comes to on time, on target, there no longer are such guarantees. The Heat traded for Terry Rozier . . . and still might need a point guard.

A: No, it shows that when you play without the shooting of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Kevin Love, your margin for error is slight. Or, in the Heat's case on Friday night, the margin for error was 13 of 47. It is going to take more than Patty Mills to make this right.

Q: Hey Jimmy Butler, no more predictions, please. - Edwin.

A: Nah, Jimmy Butler isn't going to stop, even if the results prove cringe-worthy. But what the Heat need is a Jimmy Butler capable of backing up the bravado, something closer to the Jimmy Butler we saw in the first three rounds of last season's playoffs.

Here's what to know.","Nearly three months into the new year, 2024 is carrying on where 2023 ended, with a litany of broken weather records that include higher air temperatures, warmer oceans and higher tides.

For nine months in a row, each month has set new heat records. That leaves the world's weather organizations and scientists concerned about the degree to which things continue to be so much warmer than normal -- and searching for reasons to explain why that is the case.

On Tuesday, as the United Nation's World Meteorological Organization released its annual report for 2023, Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said it's ""sounding the Red Alert to the world.""

""Never have we been so close - albeit on a temporary basis at the moment - to the 1.5° C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" Saulo said.

1.5° C: This number will shape Earth's future as the climate changes. You'll be hearing about it.

Both January and February this year were the warmest on record for the respective months of the year, making nine consecutive months of record warmth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.

In February, the global average temperature was 3.186 degrees (1.77 C) above the estimated pre-industrial average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European Union's earth observation program.

The global average temperature was also the highest on record for the 12-month period ending in February, Copernicus reported. It was more than 1.2 degrees over the 30-year average for 1991-2020 and 2.8 degrees (1.56 Celsius) over the estimated pre-industrial average

Although these global averages are above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold set in the Paris Agreement, it's not yet seen as exceeding the goal, because that is based on a long-term, consistent average rather than a measurement from any single month or year.

Still, it's cause for alarm, U.N. officials said this week.

""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators,"" said the U.N.'s Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday. ""Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding-up.""

It's normal for some weather records to be broken. What isn't so normal is the proportion of them related to warmer temperatures or the degree to which the new records shatter previous records by a long shot.

For example, in Quillayute, Washington last weekend, a weather station reported a daily record high of 80 degrees, smashing its previous record for the day by 16 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in Seattle.

Scientists continue to be astonished and alarmed by warmer temperatures across the world's oceans between the 60 degree latitude lines.

""We're just trucking along,"" said Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central.

""We still don't quite know exactly what's driving that and that's worrisome to just have this big of a signal in the ocean,"" Pershing said. ""We expect the oceans to be warmer but this is really, really significant.""

On March 10, the globe's daily average sea surface temperature briefly jumped to a new record high of 70.16 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a chart kept by the Maine Climate Reanalyzer, using NOAA data.

""We're now at one year and counting of shattering the previous records for ocean heat,"" said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami. According to model projections, he said, the warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures ""look likely"" to continue over the next few months in the North Atlantic.

The temperature anomaly is even higher in the region of the Atlantic where most major hurricanes develop. For the first two months of the year, water temperatures in the region averaged nearly 3 degrees above normal over the previous century, blowing past a record previously set in 2010 by a full degree, according to NOAA.

Given a potential La Niña pattern in the Pacific and the warmer ocean temperatures, it doesn't bode well for the Atlantic hurricane season that begins June 1.

What stands out to Pershing about this winter was the scope of the warming in the Upper Midwest. ""If you're somebody who grew up around the Great Lakes or you grew up in the kind of icy and snowy conditions in Wisconsin and Minnesota, that just was gone this year, and that's a huge change,"" he said, both psychologically and economically.

NOAA reported:

""February joins the long streak of records of the last few months,"" said Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo. ""As remarkable as this might appear, it is not really surprising as the continuous warming of the climate system inevitably leads to new temperature extremes.""

Scientists don't fully understand why temperatures are up so much more than projected.

""It's humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists' predictive capabilities more than 2023 has,"" wrote NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt in an opinion piece this week in the journal Nature.

Atmospheric greenhouse gases are responsible for part of the increase, Schmidt said.

These other factors may be playing a role, but Schmidt said they don't fully explain the surge in temperatures:

Schmidt called for improved and faster data collection to help answer questions.

In general the 2023 temperature anomaly ""has come out of the blue, revealing an unprecedented knowledge gap"" since satellites began offering comprehensive views of the Earth's climate system, he said. ""If the anomaly does not stabilize by August -- a reasonable expectation based on previous El Niño events -- then the world will be in uncharted territory.""

""We need answers for why 2023 turned out to be the warmest year in possibly the past 100,000 years,"" Schmidt wrote. ""And we need them quickly.""

NASA's new PACE mission is expected to begin providing data later this year and should be invaluable, he said.

After significant losses last year, scientists remain concerned about the world's glaciers and sea ice.

""Climate change is about much more than temperatures. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern,"" said Saulo, the WMO secretary-general.

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

FILE - Workers inspect solar panels at the fishing-solar complementary photovoltaic power generation base in Taizhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, July 12, 2023.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first 'hydrogen society.'

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.",northernirelandnews.com,news,Northern Ireland News,,0.3568627450980393,448885439,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711186601.jpg,

Researchers with the organization scored major fossil fuel companies on five metrics, including investment options, production plans, sanctions on recent products, incentives for remuneration and emissions reduction targets. In each category, the companies scored between 0 and 4, with 4 representing the closest alignment.

They assigned each company a grade of A through H, with A representing the closest to full alignment with Paris goals of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and H representing a strategy aligned with 2.4 degrees or more.

The report found the company most aligned with Paris goals was BP, which still received a grade of D-, while ConocoPhillips scored an H, the only company to receive the lowest grade. Of the five bottom scorers, three - ConocoPhillips, Pioneer and ExxonMobil - are based in the U.S.

Scores were particularly out of alignment with Paris when it came to emissions targets. None of the 25 companies scored a 4 on this metric and only one, Italian oil company Eni, scored a 3. The majority of companies - 16 - scored a zero on emissions reductions.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris Agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" report author Maeve O'Connor said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies.""

The report comes months after the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where despite widespread criticism of an oil executive as head of the summit, attendees reached an agreement to begin the transition away from fossil fuels for the first time in the summit's history.

Here's what to know.","Nearly three months into the new year, 2024 is carrying on where 2023 ended, with a litany of broken weather records that include higher air temperatures, warmer oceans and higher tides.

For nine months in a row, each month has set new heat records. That leaves the world's weather organizations and scientists concerned about the degree to which things continue to be so much warmer than normal -- and searching for reasons to explain why that is the case.

On Tuesday, as the United Nation's World Meteorological Organization released its annual report for 2023, Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said it's ""sounding the Red Alert to the world.""

""Never have we been so close - albeit on a temporary basis at the moment - to the 1.5° C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" Saulo said.

1.5° C: This number will shape Earth's future as the climate changes. You'll be hearing about it.

Both January and February this year were the warmest on record for the respective months of the year, making nine consecutive months of record warmth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.

In February, the global average temperature was 3.186 degrees (1.77 C) above the estimated pre-industrial average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European Union's earth observation program.

The global average temperature was also the highest on record for the 12-month period ending in February, Copernicus reported. It was more than 1.2 degrees over the 30-year average for 1991-2020 and 2.8 degrees (1.56 Celsius) over the estimated pre-industrial average

Although these global averages are above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold set in the Paris Agreement, it's not yet seen as exceeding the goal, because that is based on a long-term, consistent average rather than a measurement from any single month or year.

Still, it's cause for alarm, U.N. officials said this week.

""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators,"" said the U.N.'s Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday. ""Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding-up.""

The Gas Leaks Project, a group formed by climate advocacy veterans, launched a $1 million campaign this week that uses humor to push back against oil and gas industry messaging that natural gas, which is lower emitting than coal, is a critical ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy.

In recent years, research has shown that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from distribution infrastructure and other sources. A 2022 Harvard study also found that natural gas used in homes contains hazardous pollutants.

Called ""Hot &amp; Toxic,"" the campaign's trailer is a riff on a reality television show in which 21 irritating housemates symbolizing pollutants associated with natural gas descend on an unsuspecting homeowner. The message is clear: Using natural gas inside your home is not safe.

""I did not come here to make friends,"" the actor playing Carbon Monoxide, or C.Mo, says directly to the camera as if being interviewed.

""I came here to cause chest pain, nausea and vomiting.""

In addition to the trailer, the campaign includes social media content and billboards in Los Angeles and Washington. It is sponsored by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises and manages charitable giving.

""We really took a lot of care to design it in the most engaging way possible so it feels like a reality TV show,"" James Hadgis, a filmmaker who was tapped to run the Gas Leaks Project as its executive director, said in an interview. ""I hope it brings people in to want to watch it and make it fun and funny and click to learn more.""

Asked to comment on the campaign, the American Gas Association trade group said natural gas is fundamental to energy security, economic prosperity and achieving the nation's environmental goals.

""Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,"" AGA President Karen Harbert said in a statement.

Though the campaign is kicking off with warnings about the public health impacts of natural gas, Hadgis said he is eager to produce more content focused on climate.

Gas Leaks Project was created by a coalition of firms focused on climate communications, including Fossil Free Media, Energy Media, Sunstone Strategies and Climate Nexus.

""A lot of climate messaging is really boring,"" said Jamie Henn, founder of Fossil Free Media. ""We need to be out there talking to people a little less like their science teachers and a little more like their best friends.""

Iraq is the largest foreign oil importer to California and a leading country in gas flaring

By Mike Vallante, March 23, 2024 2:30 am

23 Mar 2024 2:30 am

In the heart of California's environmental policy discussions, a glaring contradiction casts a shadow over the state's commitment to leading the world in climate action. California's proposed Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) regulatory package highlights the absurdity surrounding the carbon intensity evaluations of domestic versus imported crude oil. At the center of this controversy is the state evaluation that crude oil produced within California, under some of the most rigorous environmental, health, and labor regulations globally, is deemed more carbon-intensive than oil shipped across oceans from countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Ecuador.

This discrepancy flies in the face of logic and highlights the inherent hypocrisy in the state's approach to carbon accounting. It is profoundly frustrating to witness California's environmental policies being purposely skewed by personal agendas over scientific models. How does the heavily regulated domestic oil production, where more than 25 local, state, and federal agencies oversee its operations, compare with oil from countries that don't have to adhere to our laws and often engage in damaging environmental practices?

How is oil from Ecuador, a country reported by the New York Times that is tearing down the rainforest in pursuit of oil extraction, considered less carbon-intensive? California's ""analysis"" conveniently ignores the environmental cost of tearing down one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and further compounds the irony by the fact that 50% of this oil is sold to California.

Iraq is the largest foreign oil importer to California and a leading country in gas flaring. The International Energy Agency reported that gas flaring ""is a major source of CO2 emissions, methane, and black soot, and is damaging to health.""

Equally astonishing is the environmental and logistical gymnastics required to justify crude oil being imported on tanker ships from thousands of miles away, like Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Columbia, and Guyana, is less carbon intensive than California oil production that pipes the crude directly to the refineries.

The methodological and data flaws in the OPGEE (Oil Production Greenhouse gas Emissions Estimator), which underpin these evaluations, reveal a troubling disregard for comprehensive environmental impact assessments. This model's failure to accurately capture the carbon footprint of imported oil undermines California's environmental leadership, jeopardizes the state's climate goals, and wrongfully targets a key energy industry with 55,000 California employees.

It's frustrating to see policy decisions influenced by models detached from reality. These models must consider the stringent regulations that California's domestic production must comply with including that all their greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for under the state's cap and trade program. Imports are totally exempt from this program.

Penalizing California's oil producers while inadvertently supporting environmentally detrimental practices abroad raises pressing questions about the objectives and integrity of the state's environmental policies of the individuals behind his report. Are personal goals and agendas overshadowing the commitment to truth, science, and environmental stewardship?

Behind the (LCFS) regulatory package decision are the 55,000 men and women who work in our California oil industry. They all have families and are an integral part California's economy and the communities they call home. They deserve honesty, accountability, and transparency.

This state government's decisions with our oil and energy industry must be guided by unbiased science, transparent methodologies, and a genuine commitment to the truth, not personal agendas.

Further east, a nocturnal drone attack on the Samara region set fire to a large oil refinery, the latest in a string of strikes on Russia's fuel industry.

Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Telegram that two districts in his region, as well as the regional capital, Belgorod, had been targeted by drone and air strikes.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" he said.

He shared a snapshot of a residential building with its facade largely ruined.

Another individual was murdered in a drone attack on neighborhoods outside the city, he claimed.

In the Samara region, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the eastern combat lines, the local governor claimed ""several drone attacks"" on local oil facilities.

Governor Dmitry Azarov issued a Telegram post stating that one of the incidents resulted in a fire at the Kuibyshev refinery. No casualties were reported.

According to its official website, the refinery, operated by Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the region's largest, with a production capacity of seven million tonnes per year.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, was ""repelled without causing any damage to technological equipment,"" Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia launched one of its most powerful aircraft bombardments of the two-year conflict, striking dozens of Ukrainian energy sites and temporarily cutting power to more than a million people.

Ukraine's air force said it shot down 31 of 34 Russian drones that fired on its territory overnight, while Russia's defense ministry said it intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

FILE - Workers inspect solar panels at the fishing-solar complementary photovoltaic power generation base in Taizhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, July 12, 2023.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

During this Jimmy Butler era that began in 2019, basketball fans have witnessed this gritty Heat team make multiple deep playoff runs.

They have done this in all different types of seedings. In 2020, the Heat made the NBA Finals as a fifth seed. In 2022, the Heat came within a shot of the Finals as the No. 1 seed and then made the Finals as an eighth seed the following season.

Coach Erik Spoelstra has led by example for this group of guys, making the entire roster buy into the ""we have enough"" mentality no matter the seeding or players available. Miami has been counted out and unnoticed by national media coverage for a long time now.

During last year's improbable and historic run, Butler and his teammates made it known they like to fly under the radar. This is an underrated core of motivated and connected basketball players built for postseason success.

Miami's greatest successes include taking down teams with better records when it matters most. This year, the Heat are better than their record may suggest and opposing teams know they can't overlook this seasoned team.

Let's go over three strong Eastern Conference squads that Miami has the edge over, despite their records.

On Wednesday night, the Miami Heat played the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road in what ended up being a great game and an important win.

Both teams had their runs throughout the game and were missing multiple key players due to injuries. The Heat didn't have the services of Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and Kevin Love. The Cavs were also without Donovan Mitchell, Max Strus, Evan Mobley and Dean Wade.

Miami ended up holding on for a tight 107-104 victory, improving to 2-1 against the No. 3 Cavs for the season.

Both of these wins against Cleveland this season have come with the Heat missing notable core guys. The Cavs have had regular season success during their two-year Donovan Mitchell era, but last season they were bounced out of the first round by the New York Knicks despite having homecourt advantage. Granted, they were dealing with some injuries to their frontcourt, but a team led by an All-Star duo of Mitchell and Darius Garland should have put up a better fight.

Based on Miami's regular-season success against Cleveland over the years and the Cavs' playoff inexperience and injury problems, it wouldn't be surprising if pundits picked the Heat to beat the Cavaliers in a hypothetical series.",allucanheat.com,news,All U Can Heat,,-0.003921568627450966,448884455,1,"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_320/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/115/01hshm2t0dwwa7jy0nze.jpg",eng-9413267

Whose fault is it? - Sandy.

A: It was interesting how the discourse after Friday night's loss to the Pelicans included talk about the sputtering 3-point game as well as not getting the ball where it should have gone. To me, this brings the Heat back to the 2021 offseason, when the decision was made to go for a true point guard and make the trade for Kyle Lowry. Granted, it did not end well for the Heat with Kyle, but there at least was the acknowledgement of the need for a classic distributor. Now, with Terry Rozier more of a scoring guard than passing guard, the Heat again are attempting to play point guard by committee. They certainly have plenty of capable ball handlers. But when it comes to on time, on target, there no longer are such guarantees. The Heat traded for Terry Rozier . . . and still might need a point guard.

Q: Does this game show that Duncan Robinson is the Heat's true MVP? - Michael.

A: No, it shows that when you play without the shooting of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Kevin Love, your margin for error is slight. Or, in the Heat's case on Friday night, the margin for error was 13 of 47. It is going to take more than Patty Mills to make this right.

Q: Hey Jimmy Butler, no more predictions, please. - Edwin.

A: Nah, Jimmy Butler isn't going to stop, even if the results prove cringe-worthy. But what the Heat need is a Jimmy Butler capable of backing up the bravado, something closer to the Jimmy Butler we saw in the first three rounds of last season's playoffs.

The ribbon of black sludge was 185km long, more than the distance from London to Birmingham, and almost 2km across at its widest point. It trailed a ship in such a way that it appeared to be the result of intentional dumping.

The oil slick was one of more than 2,700 identified globally by researchers over the past three years that emanated from passing vessels, using satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to track the pollution.

Until recently, little was understood outside the shipping world about the extent of the dumping as it is almost impossible to monitor comprehensively.

About 500 of the incidents were located in the waters of Indonesia, making the archipelago by far the worst affected by shipping oil slicks. The country's territorial waters are only the sixth largest globally but play host to some of the busiest shipping lanes.

There are a number of ways in which vessels accumulate oil-contaminated waste. Cheap fuel is filtered before being fed into engines, resulting in the remaining sludge, or oil leaking from an engine can build up in the hull. Oil tankers may also wash cargo tanks between loads, or fill empty ones for ballast, producing oily water that needs disposal.

Since 1983 an International Maritime Organization convention prohibits vessels from releasing any liquid into the sea containing more than 15 parts per million of oil, and they must pay to offload anything else at ports with special disposal equipment.

Retired US coastguard Rear Admiral Fred Kenney, former legal director of the IMO, said the convention had led to a ""massive improvement"" in many regions but the slicks occurring today were partly because some coastal states did not have the resources or capacity to enforce the rules.

The flag state, where a vessel is registered, is responsible for enforcement, he said, but it also relied on the coastal state, the one where the slick occurs, to monitor pollution in its seas and report it.

""If unscrupulous ships' crews and owners think they can get away with dumping oil in certain parts of the world they'll do it,"" Kenney said.

Satellite and computer modelling technology is helping to identify those responsible for the pollution that remains ""chronic"" in some parts of the world, said John Amos, the chief executive of SkyTruth, a non-profit organisation that analysed the data provided by government satellites and private company partnerships. ""Up until now this problem has been really well hidden,"" he said.

Even so, the data likely only represents a small proportion of the problem, based on a 15 per cent sample of available global satellite images that were scanned and SkyTruth researchers then reviewed. The images are taken every six to 12 days and do not cover the entirety of the world's oceans.

For 40 of the slicks tracked in south-east Asia, SkyTruth identified a registration number for the most likely responsible vessel. A search of a global registry by the Financial Times found that most were flagged to south-east Asian countries and six were Panama-registered. The Panamanian Maritime Authority did not respond to inquiries.

For three of the vessel numbers identified, the vessel owner was listed as Pertamina, the shipping arm of Indonesia's state-owned oil company. Pertamina did not respond to a request for comment.

Indonesian researchers highlighted in a 2022 paper how picturesque Bintan, nestled in a busy shipping lane a short distance from Singapore's major port, was particularly badly affected by the black sludge.

Amos said his organisation's computer model, which scans thousands of satellite images for patterns to detect the slicks, would make it easier to track in real time those responsible in future.

At present, it was problematic that the publicly available satellite imagery that it relies upon does not cover the high seas, leaving those critical areas uncovered for bad actors to treat as a dumping area.

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's 'huge' state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group - oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

'In that region, oil is cheaper than water,' notes Rettig. 'The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.'

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

'The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,' she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

FILE - Workers inspect solar panels at the fishing-solar complementary photovoltaic power generation base in Taizhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, July 12, 2023.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

'China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors - in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,' she said. 'Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.'

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first 'hydrogen society.'

As a mature producer, Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing near-field, infrastructure-led exploration to yield new discoveries and bring additional resources into production. Trident Energy launched a three-well infill drilling campaign on Block G at the start of this year utilizing the Island Innovator rig, with all three wells expected to come onstream by mid-year. The rig will then drill the Akeng deep exploration well in Kosmos Energy-operated Block S, targeting potential resources of 180 million barrels of oil. If successful, the campaign could lead to a significant rise in output from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

IAE 2024 (https://apo-opa.co/49krKXM) is an exclusive forum designed to facilitate investment between African energy markets and global investors. Taking place May 14-15, 2024 in Paris, the event offers delegates two days of intensive engagement with industry experts, project developers, investors and policymakers. For more information, please visit www.Invest-Africa-Energy.com. To sponsor or participate as a delegate, please contact sales@energycapitalpower.com.

Meanwhile, VAALCO Energy is leading development of the Venus Field in Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea, which involves drilling two producer wells and one water injector under a single campaign. The Houston-based firm is planning to bring the project online in 2026, in partnership with national oil company GEPetrol and Atlas Petroleum. Holding interests in six blocks - including producing assets in Block I - Atlas Petroleum is currently seeking farm-in and drilling partners in Blocks EG-02 and H, in which extensive 3D seismic surveys have suggested significant hydrocarbon-bearing potential.

Attracting new players to its exploration scene, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons signed three production sharing contracts last year with Africa Oil Corp. (Block EG-18 and EG-31) and Panoro Energy (EG-01), and expects to sign another for the development of Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 in the coming months. In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil&Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

""Equatorial Guinea is doubling down on gas - a key focal point of the global energy transition and investor interest. The country is single-handedly driving one of the most ambitious LNG initiatives on the continent - the GMH - which holds the potential to establish an intra-African gas trade and catalyze gas-based industries across the region. At IAE 2024, global investors can access Equatorial Guinea's latest investment prospects, as well as interface with the country's relevant oil and gas authorities,"" says Sandra Jeque, Event&Project Director at Energy Capital&Power.

The EastAfrican understands that President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government has offered to register Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) to use the Dar es Salaam port in the importation of fuel for Uganda as Kenya sticks to its guns on Uganda's demands.

Meanwhile, a case that Kampala lodged at the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) awaits determination, with no set timelines although various sources have indicated a willingness by Uganda to withdraw it, on which Kenya is banking.

Presidents William Ruto, Yoweri Museveni and Samia recently converged in Zanzibar -- rare tripartite meeting reportedly requested by Uganda, people close to the discussions say, to seek assurance of Uganda's smooth importation of petroleum and other products.

And while Kenya offers Uganda a pass through the Northern Corridor, it seems to insist on local regulatory processes, saying they are legal under Kenyan law. Nairobi is also opposed to Uganda's decision to take the matter to the regional court.

Uganda sued Kenya in December last year at the East African Court of Justice, protesting Nairobi's refusal to license Unoc to directly import fuel for Uganda as it sought a departure from the expensive private oil cartels. The Kenyan regulator, Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra), had been barred from licensing Unoc after oil marketers went to local courts to block the move.

According to sources Tanzania has registered Unoc and waived a number of local requirements to enable the company import oil. Some of those conditions include exemption of work permits, waivers on some taxes, free yards at the port, allowing Uganda to directly manage the company's processes and reducing road blocks.

This week, some oil companies confirmed they had received supplies from the Unoc.

If Unoc finds it easier importing via Tanzania, it means Uganda could look away from Kenya in a significant shift, and hurt Kenya's revenues. Kampala has imported most of its oil via the port of Mombasa, with 90 percent of that picked up through the Kenya Pipeline depots in western Kenya.

This week, Kenya said it was negotiating with Kampala to resolve the dispute over the fuel imports in spite of the case before the EACJ.

Trade Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano said discussions are underway to resolve the dispute.

""There are discussions that are likely to resolve the matter that is before court,"" Ms Miano told The EastAfrican.

Uganda, meanwhile, admits that Tanzania has lobbied massively, targeting to convince Kampala to reroute all its oil business, and other import trade via Dar.

""The government of Tanzania has been very supportive and we are moving very fast in terms of getting access routes through the port of Dar,"" Rose Nakabirwa, Uganda's Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources told The EastAfrican.

But she was quick to clarify that Uganda won't put all its eggs in one basket.

""We will still push to have access to the port of Mombasa because we have a right to be given access under the United Nations conventions. It is a shame to the diplomatic relations that we have had to go to court,"" the minister said.

After the Zanzibar meeting on March 14, two things emerged, according to sources who spoke to The EastAfrican. While the three leaders see the need to end squabbling, they also see the utility of the political tool in their local rules. For Uganda, the competition between Kenya and Tanzania offers a bargaining chip.

Tanzania sees the tiff with Kenya as an opportunity to get a customer while Kenya has chosen to wait out for Uganda to tire.

Read: Uganda in talks to import all its oil via Tanzania

""Tanzania's entry in the tiff is frustrating because they want to offer their deal on the cheap. Kenya, on the other hand, has given Uganda what it offered before: Unoc has to apply and follow the relevant procedure,"" a Kenyan official familiar with the talks told The EastAfrican.

Kenya says it can waive some of those requirements but does not want Uganda to question the regulatory processes. As such, the official indicated Kenya is willing to grant Unoc those waivers if Uganda formally withdraws the case at the EACJ.

""Kenya's view is that these regulatory processes are not meant to hinder Uganda from accessing petroleum products but they are meant to instil transparency and accountability in dealing with petroleum products. This is consistent with Kenya's Constitution,"" the source indicated.

Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are the founding members of the East African Community and the March 14 meeting was meant to demonstrate willingness to talk out disputes. It also marked the anniversary of the day, in 1996, when leaders from the three countries re-assembled in Arusha to re-establish the EAC, which had collapsed in 1977.

It was Ruto's second time this year meeting with Museveni after the falling-out over oil importation and other trade disputes. Kenya roped in former prime minister Raila Odinga as some kind of ""special envoy"" to help broker negotiations. Raila's achievement, officials say, was the re-establishment of the communication channels between Nairobi and Kampala, which had broken.

But it hasn't ended the dispute yet, because officials also admit that there some senior political figures in Kenya keen to protect their stranglehold on the oil export business to Uganda. In turn, Uganda has chosen to bank on the protection of the East African Community legal regime.

In EACJ, however, Kenya has stuck to its guns, declaring the Ugandan case a waste of the court's time. In a response filed by the Attorney-General, Nairobi said Uganda had, in fact, agreed to the regulatory processes demanded by Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) and ""cannot turn around and question their legal standing.""

""The Republic of Kenya, through its stated organs, and in good faith, sought to waive aspects of the Regulatory requirements, which intention, was, however, stayed by the High Court, an independent organ of the Republic of Kenya not subject to control or direction by any person or authority,"" the Kenyan Attorney General said in filings on February 28.

Kenya says Uganda should have waited for the case in the Kenyan court to be determined before declaring that Nairobi had refused to provide Unoc with the licence. In fact, it argues that the EACJ cannot hear an appeal on issues guided and decided by Kenyan courts on local laws.

Kenya, through the Ministry of Energy and the Epra issued a raft of requirements that Unoc needed to comply with in order to get the licence.

Uganda claimed that Kenya had reneged on an earlier commitment, made in April 2023, to support Kampala's quest to directly import its fuel starting January 2024.

""The actions of the Kenyan judiciary in issuing the conservatory orders restraining, among others, Epra from issuing the licence to Uganda contravenes the EAC Treaty,"" said Uganda's Attorney General in the suit at EACJ.

Uganda wants Kenya compelled to licence Unoc.

A Polish court has come to the defence of Czech citizens by overturning the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Turów mine, a controversial Polish open-cast mine near the Czech border.

According to the Polish Administrative Court in Warsaw, the original EIA report for the Turów coal mine - which allowed the mine to obtain a mining licence until 2044 - downplayed the damage caused by mining. The impact of mining activities on groundwater and land is much more serious than the mine operator, the Polish state-owned PGE, claimed.

The Polish court thus confirmed the fears of Czechs, who have long complained about the mine.

Czech citizens represented in local organisations also called for a revision of an existing Czech-Polish agreement, signed two years ago, to resolve the long-running dispute over the Turów mine.

The deal includes financial compensation and measures by Poland to prevent further damage caused by the intensive mining.

""Water is still disappearing from Czech territory because of the Turów mine,"" Greenpeace campaign coordinator Nikol Krejčová said in reaction to the Polish court decision. ""The Czech-Polish agreement did not prevent this and did not solve anything.""

""The negative impact of mining in the Turów mine on the local population on the Czech side of the border is therefore enormous. Paradoxically, these people are now being defended by the Polish court more than by their own government of Prime Minister Petr Fiala,"" she added.

The agreement also aims to ensure that the situation is monitored, particularly with regard to groundwater loss and land subsidence. However, there are problems with the transmission of older data.

""I'm not happy about it myself,"" Czech Environment Minister Petr Hladík (KDU-ČSL, EPP) told Euractiv Czechia in a recent interview. ""All measurements from the Czech side are public, but from the Polish side, only the data since the agreement was made are published.""

The data collected by the Polish side prior to the conclusion of the agreement was classified as a trade secret.

""I will try to persuade the new Polish Minister of the Environment, Paulina Hennig-Kloska, that we do not see this positively,"" Hladík said.

The Czech minister wanted to discuss the issue with his Polish counterpart during last week's meeting of Central and Eastern European ministers in the Czech Republic. However, the Polish minister did not attend.

Both Hladík and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala (ODS, ECR) are convinced that the Czech-Polish agreement has improved the situation and that it was necessary. However, Fiala confirmed he would look into the Polish court ruling and discuss the issue with his Polish counterparts.",energyindemand.com,news,Energy in Demand - Sustainable Energy - Rod Janssen,Rod Janssen,-0.05882352941176472,448883459,1,https://energyindemand.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/icon-04.png?w=240,zho-1584856

""The main purpose of the project is to develop the Eastern Gas Supply System of the Russian Federation in regions of Eastern Siberia and the Far East,"" the government said in the updated national territorial planning scheme in the area of federal transport (as regards pipeline transport), which now includes this project.

The project calls for the comprehensive development of gas transport capacity in Eastern Russia and its subsequent connection with gas infrastructure in the western part of the country, Gazprom said in a press release.

""This will ensure additional reliability and flexibility of gas supplies to domestic consumers and open up new opportunities to develop the gasification of regions in Siberia and the Far East,"" the company said.

President Vladimir Putin earlier issued orders to bring piped natural gas service to regions that did not previously have access to it, including Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Jewish Autonomous Region.

The EGSS will run from the northern part of the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic to Khabarovsk Territory in Russia's Far East and will have design capacity to carry 28.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year, according to the territorial planning scheme.

The gas transport corridor begins on the Yamal Peninsula, in the Yamalsky district of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, and runs through the Nadymsky and Purovsky districts and Noyabrsk.

In the Khanty Mansi Autonomous District, it crosses the Surgutsky district, Kogalym and Nizhnevartovsky district, and in Tomsk Region it runs from the Alexandrovsky to the Zyryansky district.

Gas pipelines have already been laid from the central districts of Yamalo-Nenets to Tomsk Region, which here the project will involve expanding the gas transport system.

In the Kuznetsk Basin, the planned pipeline only crosses the Mariinsky municipal district.

In Krasnoyarsk Territory, pipeline has been laid from the Bolsheuluisky to the Nizhneingashsky district, and in the Yemelyanovsky district, approaching Krasnoyarsk, near the village of Pamyati 13 Bortsov.

In Irkutsk Region, the pipeline runs from the Taishetsky district to the outskirts of Irkutsk (Usolsky and Slyudyansky districts). Gazprom's Kovykta field, the starting point of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, is also located in Irkutsk Region.

Another part of the EGSS is a connector between the Power of Siberia and Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipelines that will run across Amur Region (Seryshevsky-Arkharinsky districts), the Jewish Autonomous Region (Obluchensky, Birobidzhansky and Smidovichsky districts) and Khabarovsk Territory (Amursky, Nanaisky and Khabarovsky districts).

This connector will essentially link the Yakutsk and Sakhalin gas production centers, increasing the reliability of gas supplies for the whole region.

Gazprom's Chayanda field, the foundation of the Yakutsk production center, is expected to reach full design capacity in 2024.

Gazprom, meanwhile, has also announced the start of the first phase of the project, involving the connection of the Power of Siberia and Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipelines.

""Construction of the Belogorsk-Khabarovsk section of the Eastern Gas Supply System began in 2024 for this purpose,"" Gazprom said. Design and survey work is also underway on other sections of the system. ■",poandpo.com,news,POST Online Media,,0.2,448883417,1,https://www.histerius.com/hs0324/gazprom.jpg,rus-1629520

Researchers with the organization scored major fossil fuel companies on five metrics, including investment options, production plans, sanctions on recent products, incentives for remuneration and emissions reduction targets. In each category, the companies scored between 0 and 4, with 4 representing the closest alignment.

They assigned each company a grade of A through H, with A representing the closest to full alignment with Paris goals of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and H representing a strategy aligned with 2.4 degrees or more.

The report found the company most aligned with Paris goals was BP, which still received a grade of D-, while ConocoPhillips scored an H, the only company to receive the lowest grade. Of the five bottom scorers, three - ConocoPhillips, Pioneer and ExxonMobil - are based in the U.S.

Scores were particularly out of alignment with Paris when it came to emissions targets. None of the 25 companies scored a 4 on this metric and only one, Italian oil company Eni, scored a 3. The majority of companies - 16 - scored a zero on emissions reductions.

""Companies worldwide are publicly stating they are supportive of the goals of the Paris Agreement, and claim to be part of the solution in accelerating the energy transition,"" report author Maeve O'Connor said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, however, we see that none are currently aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, albeit there are clear differences between companies.""

The report comes months after the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where despite widespread criticism of an oil executive as head of the summit, attendees reached an agreement to begin the transition away from fossil fuels for the first time in the summit's history.

The rules still need to overcome opposition by another state agency.

The rules were approved Thursday by the board of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, commonly known as Cal/OSHA, despite a late objection from the state Department of Finance because of cost effects on the state, the Los Angeles Times reported.

There is no federal heat standard in the United States. California has had heat protection rules for outdoor work such as agriculture and construction since 2006. But tackling indoor heat protections has taken years since the state passed legislation in 2016 to draft standards for indoor workers.

The proposed regulations would apply to workplaces ranging from warehouses to schools and kitchens, requiring cooling devices, access to water and cooling-off break areas at certain temperature thresholds as well as monitoring for signs of heat illness.

Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, applauded the vote and said 15 million workers in the state stand to benefit.

""The hottest years on record have occurred in the last ten years. That means the danger of working in high heat has become more acute in the time it has taken to finalize these standards,"" Kaoosji said in a statement.

California experienced an e-commerce-driven boom in the construction of massive warehouses for companies such as Amazon. Concerns about heat illnesses have been repeatedly raised by workers in the industry.

Amazon said in a statement that its heat safety protocols often exceed industry standards, and it provides air conditioning in all of its fulfillment centers and air hubs.

The Department of Finance sought to halt the Cal/OSHA board's vote, citing concerns about huge costs to correctional and other facilities.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, told the Times the impact ""could be in the neighborhood of billions of dollars.""

The state Office of Administrative Law will need the Department of Finance's approval before it can move forward with the regulations, Palmer said.

Palmer also said the Department of Finance only received some of the data involving the regulations in February.

""This was a decision that was driven by our inability to do our fiscal due diligence and evaluate this data late in the process that had a potential impact to the state,"" he said.

Labor and climate activists opposed the effort to remove the heat-protection item from Thursday's meeting agenda, and board Chair David Thomas agreed.

""There's no reason this shouldn't be passed in my mind, because they are right that their lives are the ones that are on the line,"" Thomas said.",accesswdun.com,news,Access WDUN,,0.192156862745098,448883085,1,https://7b1de02a7bcf9c1df487-6849f9022b05f72b83236695aa4e9a0a.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploads/ap/2024/1234244/image-0.jpg,

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's ""huge"" state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group -- oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

""In that region, oil is cheaper than water,"" notes Rettig. ""The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.""

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

""The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,"" she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

""China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors -- in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,"" she said. ""Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.""

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first ""hydrogen society.""

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,,0.3568627450980393,448882896,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/BCEF5ED6-76A4-446F-BE3A-9EB73D891B9C.jpg,

The National Vice President, Association of Refineries Petroleum Marketers, Nwaozuzu Chigozie, has revealed why it is difficult to end illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta.

In an interview on Channels TV's Politics Today, Chigozie said there was an issue of trust between the people of Niger Delta and the government.

Mike Hinson, the state's newly appointed chief resilience officer, says he's ready for the challenge.

The Maryland General Assembly passed legislation in its 2022 session establishing an Office of Resilience to be set up within the Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) -- a peripheral agency dealing mostly with terrorism, safety and homeland security issues.

The legislation was sponsored by Sen. Katie Hester (D-Howard County) who said at the time that seeing Ellicott City's downtown area devastated by floods in 2016 and 2018 moved her to push for the legislation.

The bill, which went into effect in October 2022, created the position of a chief resilience officer (CRO) to be appointed by the director of MDEM, and mandated coordinating statewide efforts to meet the challenges brought on by climate change and natural disasters.

In November, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore appointed Mike Hinson as the state's first chief resilience officer. Hinson worked with Howard Country's emergency management office when Ellicott City experienced the floods and was involved in recovery efforts. The CRO position is one of just seven similar jobs nationwide.

""Hinson will focus on developing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary resilience strategy for the state to adapt, mitigate, and recover from all hazards and emergencies,"" Moore's office said while announcing the appointment.

""Hinson will work within the Maryland Department of Emergency Management to provide statewide coordination for resilience across all hazards, ensuring that Maryland can adapt to changing conditions and prepare for, withstand, and rapidly recover from disruptions to everyday life.""

Born and raised in Prince George's County, Hinson spent his middle and high school years in Montgomery County. He worked for more than 10 years with the Howard County Office of Emergency Management in various positions, including more than three years as director.

Four months into his new position, Hinson sat down with Inside Climate News to talk about his plans for the position. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

What are the most immediate resilience challenges for Maryland, in your opinion?

Climate issues. And not just increasing frequency of severe storms, which are very well documented, especially in this region. One case study is Ellicott City, which experienced flooding in 2016 and then in 2018. But if you look around our region in general, we have flooding going on in Annapolis on a regular basis. The same with Fredericksburg, Virginia. In general, this entire area has seen an increased amount of flooding over the years.

When I first started working in the Howard County Office of Emergency Management, it was pretty rare to have a flash flood advisory. By 2019 and 2020, we went to nearly two dozen flooding events a year, which is quite an uptick from three or four a year. And then we're seeing some real increases in temperature. And this is worrisome because challenges from extreme heat are very serious, particularly for vulnerable communities. Both the storm severities and extreme heat are of specific concern to me going forward.

What experience do you bring to your new job as Maryland's first chief resilience officer?

Previously, I served as director of emergency management for Howard County, where I held several positions prior to that. So, over a decade of working through emergency management systems and operations. Unfortunately, the Ellicott City floods in 2016 and then in 2018 happened in my own jurisdiction, which led to hands-on experience of being the home jurisdiction for a presidentially declared disaster. A good deal of my work involved running the emergency operations center, which required coordinating and deploying resources during both of those floods. That's what led me down this road and at some point I got my certified climate change professional certification. I did my best to link the two streams of emergency management and climate change together because it's something that we in the emergency management profession are going to be facing more and more as time goes by.

What does resilience mean for Maryland?

We are currently at the very end of the process of determining how we're going to define resilience for Maryland differently from what it means at the federal level. Most states that have an office of resilience or a chief resilience officer define it differently. I'm in the process of meeting with the secretaries of various state agencies to go over the process and tease out the outcomes we would like to focus on. There's a lot of different pieces that we need to make sure are covered under the resilience framework including food systems, environmental systems, economic systems, housing systems and so forth.

What happens once that language is sorted out?

The next step is implementing a work plan, which is also being discussed with our key partners and stakeholders. If you look at the legislation around the creation of the office and the position of chief resilience officer (CRO), it's really talking about bringing different agencies together to make sure that we are working toward a coherent strategy. That's why we're meeting with various state agencies and their secretaries to make sure they're on board with the work plan through 2025. Our next step is to really start implementing it as soon as it's approved. And the other tier one priority from the legislation is to come up with a statewide resilience strategy. That is going to be our main focus in year one. Having spoken to my counterparts in seven other states, I believe it could take anywhere between 18 to 36 months. We're hoping to be on the shorter end of that timeline.

Who else is on your team or are you a part of an existing team?

I have three other positions to assist the Office of Resilience. We have a food resilience coordinator position for the Food Systems Resilience Council. Then we have a resilience planning position and a deputy CRO position. I expect all of these vacancies to be filled in April. It's a small team and we will be working pretty much on everything. Right now, we are based within the Maryland Department of Emergency Management, which is a great place for us to be. Secretary Russell Strickland has been great to work with and very supportive of our goals.

Can you give us a sense of what resilience-related projects or programs are currently underway in Maryland?

One thing I'm inheriting right off the bat would be the Food Systems Resilience Council. It's a 19-person council that was born out of COVID-19 pandemic and focuses on food access and insecurity by looking at the entirety of the food supply chain. We act as a support mechanism for the council, which is now evolving beyond its pandemic mandate.

There's a lot happening that the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) such as shoreline and coastal resilience work, desalination projects and similarly the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) also has a lot of going on. That being said, one of the first things happening within the Office of Resilience is inventory of all those projects. There's so much going on right now that could be considered resilience projects. For us to have a broad statewide resilience strategy, it is important to have an inventory of projects. It's really about information sharing and communication.

Do you feel you have the support structure to accomplish what you're setting out to do?

We've got some experienced people in the Maryland Department of Emergency Management who have worked in the resilience space quite a bit because MDEM deals with hazard mitigation and disaster risk reduction. They have worked with me through the initial steps on our work plan. And basing us at MDEM was the best decision because it is led by a secretary-level position who reports directly to the governor and has the necessary resources at its disposal. It's important for us to be up and running quickly and then having a direct line to the administration to make sure that we're able to move Maryland forward on resilience.

You're a political appointee. How long would your position continue?

As long as Secretary Strickland and Gov. Moore would like me to. Having worked in government before, it can be a mixed bag sometimes of how you're received when you're in a new setup or in a new position. It's been very positive. And it gives me a lot of hope that we can make some big moves.",insideclimatenews.org,news,InsideClimate News,Derek Harrison,-0.05882352941176472,448882412,1,https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-991294410-1024x683.jpg,

Kansas State University farm management extension specialist Gregg Ibendahl said the price of oil, inflation rates and demand for fertilizer impact the price of one of the most expensive inputs in farming -- fertilizer.

""When we look at the variable expenses, fertilizer is the most important one,"" Ibendahl said. ""Farmers have got a lot of money tied up in growing a crop, especially with something like corn, or grain sorghum or wheat, where you're putting a lot of nitrogen on your product. Those crops use a lot of fertilizer, and whenever those prices go up, we see a corresponding hit to the farmer's bottom line.""

Ibendahl said oil prices play a crucial role in setting fertilizer costs.

""Oil is a big driver, so whenever we see oil prices go up, we're going to see a corresponding hit on the fertilizer side. As long as the oil prices stay in the $70 range, I think you'll look at fertilizer prices as being steady,"" he said.

Like a lot of other input costs, inflation proves to be another factor affecting how much farmers pay for fertilizer.

""As long as we have inflation down to the three percent to four percent range, you're looking at fertilizer in the $800 (per ton) range as pretty realistic,"" Ibendahl said.

Ultimately the availability of fertilizer can play the biggest role in determining its price. In years when producers plant more crops with high nitrogen requirements, fertilizer prices increase, Ibendahl said.

""When we see the prices for grains favoring more corn production, we're going to see a bigger hit to the farmer's bottom line because they're going to have to apply nitrogen.""

Buying fertilizer during certain times of the year can create tax advantages and cost savings for producers.

""If you go back and look at what happened a year ago, a lot of farmers tend to want to buy fertilizer in the fall because they can count that as an expense in the current year, and it can help lower things for tax purposes,"" he said. ""A year ago, it was the case that fertilizer prices went down all winter so those farmers who bought fertilizer later in the year actually came out ahead of those folks who bought fertilizer earlier in the year.""

Ibendahl forecasts a different trend in fertilizer prices during 2024 and urges producers not to follow this past year's buying pattern.

""I don't think that's going to be the case this year. I don't think waiting and buying fertilizer this spring will allow much saving because fertilizer has been rising a good portion of the winter,"" Ibendahl said.

""I think fertilizer tends to be steady during the year. I don't see a lot of downside potential in the fertilizer market based on the fertilizer price and inflation price. I don't see fertilizer prices going lower; I think the risk of things going higher is a bigger risk to producers.""

Most Read from Bloomberg

Indian oil refiners -- Moscow's second-biggest customers after China since the 2022 invasion -- will no longer accept tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot PJSC because of the risk posed by sanctions.

Since the start of October, the US has ratcheted up sanctions on the wider fleet of tankers moving Russian crude oil. Dozens of those targeted have been languishing ever since, and more barrels of Russian diesel are floating idly on the oceans than at any time since 2017, according to analytics firm Kpler.

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterized by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards $90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a grueling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

""It's a growing squeeze on Russian export flows, particularly to India,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. ""We're at the stage where sanctions-related friction is becoming very evident.""

Since October, the US has designated 40 individual Russian oil tankers. Four of the more recently targeted ones are continuing to make deliveries, but no sanctioned ship has collected a cargo since being named by the US Treasury, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Now, an increasingly tough trading environment has delivered a powerful symbolic blow to the Kremlin as India -- a stalwart commercial ally throughout war -- shuns its fleet. At the same time, Ukraine has started blowing up Russian oil refineries, though it's not clear how much support for the strategy it enjoys in Washington.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and on exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. ""It comes at a time when the US is struggling to send more aid to Ukraine, when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline, and when Russia appears to be gaining the upper hand.""

State-run Sovcomflot transported about a fifth of all Russia's crude deliveries to India last year. The figure appeared to be in decline even before the news that nation's refineries would no longer accept the ships.

""We expect and welcome that global oil buyers will be much less willing to deal with Sovcomflot than in the past,"" a US Treasury spokesperson said, adding that the measures should have no oil market impact because Russia will maintain an incentive to sell oil.""

Now that fleet will need to find work elsewhere -- and there are signs it's struggling. At least seven of the vessels have come to a halt in the Black Sea and disappeared from digital monitoring systems, tanker tracking by Bloomberg shows. Sovcomflot admitted this week that sanctions had hurt its operations.

""The targeting of Sovcomflot represents a significant tightening of US sanctions against Russia,"" said Janis Kluge, senior associate for Eastern Europe and Eurasia at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ""It will not solve the problem of circumvention, but it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

Even so, Russia can still draw on a so-called ""shadow fleet"" of vessels amassed shortly after the 2022 invasion -- often older ships without proper insurance and with unclear ownership -- to make its deliveries. By some estimates, there are as many as 600 such carriers in operation, alongside Greek tankers that continue to serve the trade under the G-7 price cap.

Delivery costs for Russian oil are huge. It costs about $14.50 a barrel to delivery a Baltic Sea cargo to China, according to data from Argus Media. Well over half that sum is attributable to sanctions, it estimates.

""Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts,"" said Bronze at Energy Aspects.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to March 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Kluge.

Nicknamed ""gas station heroin,"" the product, which includes the drug tianeptine, is also known as Zaza, Tianna, Pegasus, Neptune's Fix and Tia. It can be easily found online and at gas stations and vape shops without showing any ID or prescription. There is no age limit, meaning even someone under 18 could buy it.

""It's the equivalent of selling heroin in a convenience store,"" said Rep. Stephen Ross, (R-Alamance). ""I mean how long are you gonna let that go on?""

Ross, who serves as chairman of the N.C. House Select Committee on Substance Abuse, is pushing for the drug to be classified and regulated as a narcotic under House Bill 563.

During a recent meeting, the committee noted that tianeptine has a high possibility for abuse and cited other states already regulating it as evidence to take swift action. As of early March, 13 states had regulated the drug.

Making tianeptine a schedule 1 drug would effectively ban it from North Carolina stores and from purchase online, Ross said. He hopes to make this change during the General Assembly's short session beginning in late April.

In other countries, tianeptine is approved for use in treating depression, but in the United States the FDA has not approved it for any use. In fact, the FDA issued a warning that it has potential for abuse and can lead to severe health concerns. It has cited seizure and loss of consciousness as reasons for the public to avoid it.

Other side effects, according to the FDA, could include agitation, rapid heartbeat, confusion, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, slowed breathing, coma, high blood pressure and death.

There's been an increase in the detection and use of tianeptine in recent years as shown in a study the CDC published. Between 2000 and 2013, the National Poison Data System reported 11 tianeptine exposure calls. They received more calls between 2014 and 2017 with the total reaching 207.

Ross said he is almost 100% confident the bill could pass.

Kenny House, a licensed clinical addiction specialist and clinical liaison at Coastal Horizons treatment center in Wilmington, said providers around the state are seeing users attempt to taper themselves off opioids, like Fentanyl, with tianeptine.

This approach is not backed by providers and poses risk for relapse, he said. Instead, House said, the best course of action for getting off Fentanyl, or other opioids, is medication assisted treatment.

""The majority of people who are going to be dependent on opioids, are going to do best to get a combination of medications like buprenorphine or methadone along with some behavioral support,"" House said.

The tianeptine products, which can come in powder, pill or liquid form are marketed as a dietary supplement that can help with anxiety, depression and opioid dependence. A bottle can cost between $30 and $40.

Despite the enticing colorful packaging many of the bottles have, Nabarun Dasgupta, senior scientist at University of North Carolina who studies drugs and infectious diseases, said he is not particularly concerned about kids' access to it.

The ""price point is higher than you'd expect for kids to be able to afford on a regular basis,"" Dasgupta said.

Tianeptine's appearance on the shelves of vape shops and gas station stores could be due to the poor regulation of dietary supplements and vitamins in the United States, Dasgupta said, adding that the future of tianeptine's prevalence is unknown.

""Given how often we see new things, most of them don't stick,"" Dasgupta said. ""It might not stick. It's kind of at a tipping point.""

Meanwhile, House said it's good that the legislature is getting ahead of tianeptine before it becomes a crisis. But he hopes that access to treatment is taken into account when implementing regulatory legislation.

""Making something illegal doesn't reduce addiction,"" House said. ""Making something illegal reduces access to that particular substance, which is good, but then on the other hand we also want to continue to work to destigmatize addiction and addictive medicine and to promote treatment access and treatment opportunities for people. Those things go hand in hand.""

In response to the threat tianeptine poses, the FDA has taken action to protect consumers.

""We have issued warning letters to companies illegally marketing tianeptine products as dietary supplements and unapproved drugs,"" according to the FDA website. ""We also have issued import alerts to help stop tianeptine shipments at our borders.""

Per FDA recommendations, if you need help treating anxiety, depression or substance abuse contact a medical provider.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to March 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto retained the figure skating world title with a stellar performance in Montreal on Friday and became the first woman to win three straight crowns since American Peggy Fleming in 1968.

Sakamoto was in fourth place after the short program, but the 23-year-old's dazzling free skate to ""Wild Is The Wind/Feeling Good"" by Lauryn Hill helped her match 1968 Olympic champion Fleming, who won three world titles between 1966-68.

Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Sakamoto's run began with a double axel and a triple Lutz, before a series of intricate combination jumps brought thunderous applause from the crowd at the Bell Centre.

""I was fourth in the short program, so I was a little anxious about that, but today I was in a really good place emotionally,"" said Sakamoto, who finished with 222.96 points. ""I was able to calm down today. I was able to keep focused and do my elements one after the other and I am happy with this result.""

American Isabeau Levito, a world junior champion in 2022, won silver with a score of 212.16 while Chaeyeon Kim of South Korea took bronze with 203.59.

Belgium's Loena Hendrickx, who led after the short program, finished fourth after falling while attempting a triple flip.

Earlier on Friday, veteran ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates scored a 90.08 for their rhythm dance routine at the world championships, putting the Americans on the cusp of a second consecutive world title.

Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri were in second after notching a 87.52, and home favourites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada held third with 86.51 ahead of Saturday's free dance.

Performing to music by Queen, Chock and Bates drew roars from the crowd for their smooth twizzle sequence, closing rotational lift and sassy attitude.

New polio vaccine passes test, but will be delayed

The new polio vaccine has passed its first human tests on 90 children and adults with flying colors. But ""there will be no polio vaccine"" for general use this summer.

This was announced last night by Dr. Jonas E. Salk, 38, young virus researcher of the University of Pittsburgh.

The creamy vaccine, homogenized in mineral oil, gave all 90 persons protective antibodies against all three types of the virus which can cause human polio, he said. And it is perfectly safe.

The patients have kept this protection so far for six to eight weeks. They were vaccinated only that long ago.....

But 90 persons is too small a number to say that the vaccine will actually work for everyone, Dr. Salk made clear. He indicated many more careful tests must be made on hundreds or thousands of people first....

Twenty years ago a vaccine was released prematurely, he said, and there were kickbacks, some cases of paralysis and deaths after vaccinations because not enough was then known about the tricky polio virus....

""We want to reach our goal as quickly as possible, but this cannot be done in one day. It will be achieved if we move cautiously and with understanding step by step,"" Salk said....

Statistics show that one child of every 150 develops paralytic polio throughout their lifetime.

Salk's announcement was one of great drama about the most promising vaccine yet to appear. It represents the culmination of years of work by hundreds of scientists and $18,000,000 in March of Dimes funds....

An accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania apparently damaged the reactor core and sent radioactive material beaming into the atmosphere, the government said yesterday.

Officials said their readings indicated there was no immediate danger to the public, and there were no plans to evacuate the 15,000 people living within a mile of the plant.

Edison Case, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman, said radiation levels inside the plant's reactor building registered at 1,000 times normal. But George Troffer, manager of generation quality assurance for Metropolitan Edison, one of the consortium of companies that runs the plant, said he thought that figure was too high. He said the level was perhaps 10 times higher than normal....

In Washington, Sen. Gary Hart said human error appeared to have been a factor in the incident. Hart, a Colorado Democrat, is chairman of the Senate subcommittee on nuclear radiation.

""I am informed [by the NRC] that the emergency core cooling system was turned off prematurely - resulting in partial blockage of water needed to cool the nuclear core and keep it under control,"" he said....

A statement from General Public Utilities, the consortium which operates the plant, said there was ""some low-level release of radioactive gas beyond the site boundary...""

""Despite this release, the company does not believe the level constitutes a danger to the health and safety of the public,"" the statement said....

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterized by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards $90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a grueling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Indian oil refiners -- Moscow's second-biggest customers after China since the 2022 invasion -- will no longer accept tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot PJSC because of the risk posed by sanctions.

Since the start of October, the US has ratcheted up sanctions on the wider fleet of tankers moving Russian crude oil. Dozens of those targeted have been languishing ever since, and more barrels of Russian diesel are floating idly on the oceans than at any time since 2017, according to analytics firm Kpler.

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterized by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards $90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a grueling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

""It's a growing squeeze on Russian export flows, particularly to India,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. ""We're at the stage where sanctions-related friction is becoming very evident.""

Since October, the US has designated 40 individual Russian oil tankers. Four of the more recently targeted ones are continuing to make deliveries, but no sanctioned ship has collected a cargo since being named by the US Treasury, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Now, an increasingly tough trading environment has delivered a powerful symbolic blow to the Kremlin as India -- a stalwart commercial ally throughout war -- shuns its fleet. At the same time, Ukraine has started blowing up Russian oil refineries, though it's not clear how much support for the strategy it enjoys in Washington.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and on exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. ""It comes at a time when the US is struggling to send more aid to Ukraine, when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline, and when Russia appears to be gaining the upper hand.""

State-run Sovcomflot transported about a fifth of all Russia's crude deliveries to India last year. The figure appeared to be in decline even before the news that nation's refineries would no longer accept the ships.

""We expect and welcome that global oil buyers will be much less willing to deal with Sovcomflot than in the past,"" a US Treasury spokesperson said, adding that the measures should have no oil market impact because Russia will maintain an incentive to sell oil.""

Now that fleet will need to find work elsewhere -- and there are signs it's struggling. At least seven of the vessels have come to a halt in the Black Sea and disappeared from digital monitoring systems, tanker tracking by Bloomberg shows. Sovcomflot admitted this week that sanctions had hurt its operations.

""The targeting of Sovcomflot represents a significant tightening of US sanctions against Russia,"" said Janis Kluge, senior associate for Eastern Europe and Eurasia at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ""It will not solve the problem of circumvention, but it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

Even so, Russia can still draw on a so-called ""shadow fleet"" of vessels amassed shortly after the 2022 invasion -- often older ships without proper insurance and with unclear ownership -- to make its deliveries. By some estimates, there are as many as 600 such carriers in operation, alongside Greek tankers that continue to serve the trade under the G-7 price cap.

Delivery costs for Russian oil are huge. It costs about $14.50 a barrel to delivery a Baltic Sea cargo to China, according to data from Argus Media. Well over half that sum is attributable to sanctions, it estimates.

""Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts,"" said Bronze at Energy Aspects.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to March 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Kluge.

""I was fourth in the short program, so I was a little anxious about that, but today I was in a really good place emotionally,"" said Sakamoto, who finished with 222.96 points.

""I was able to calm down today. I was able to keep focused and do my elements one after the other and I am happy with this result.""

American Isabeau Levito, a world junior champion in 2022, won silver with a score of 212.16 while Chaeyeon Kim of South Korea took bronze with 203.59.

Belgium's Loena Hendrickx, who led after the short program, finished fourth after falling while attempting a triple flip.

Earlier on Friday, veteran ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates scored a 90.08 for their rhythm dance routine at the world championships, putting the Americans on the cusp of a second consecutive world title.

Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri were in second after notching a 87.52, and home favorites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada held third with 86.51 ahead of Saturday's free dance.

Performing to music by Queen, Chock and Bates drew roars from the crowd for their smooth twizzle sequence, closing rotational lift and sassy attitude.

""We went out there, and I know it sounds cheesy, but to have the time of our lives,"" said Bates. ""We've been looking to a Montreal worlds for a long time. Being here for an 11th world championship, healthy and still enjoying it all, it's the greatest victory of all.""

Chock, 31, and Bates, 35, relocated to Montreal after a disappointing finish at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Indian oil refiners -- Moscow's second-biggest customers after China since the 2022 invasion -- will no longer accept tankers owned by state-run Sovcomflot PJSC because of the risk posed by sanctions.

Since the start of October, the US has ratcheted up sanctions on the wider fleet of tankers moving Russian crude oil. Dozens of those targeted have been languishing ever since, and more barrels of Russian diesel are floating idly on the oceans than at any time since 2017, according to analytics firm Kpler.

Taken together, these moves have the potential to gradually constrict Russian petroleum revenues, a key policy goal of the US and its allies as they seek to thwart military aggression by President Vladimir Putin.

The Group of Seven's approach to sanctions on Russia has been characterized by its refusal to cause any pain to its own economies in the form of higher oil prices. Washington came up with the so-called price cap policy precisely to soften the sanctions that were being cooked up in Brussels. And since the war started two years ago, Russia has continued to export huge amounts of oil.

While there's no expectation of drastic supply cuts at this stage, the question is how far western regulators will go in tightening the screws while oil prices head towards $90 a barrel and President Joe Biden begins a grueling election campaign with painful inflation still in voters' minds.

""It's a growing squeeze on Russian export flows, particularly to India,"" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. ""We're at the stage where sanctions-related friction is becoming very evident.""

Since October, the US has designated 40 individual Russian oil tankers. Four of the more recently targeted ones are continuing to make deliveries, but no sanctioned ship has collected a cargo since being named by the US Treasury, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Now, an increasingly tough trading environment has delivered a powerful symbolic blow to the Kremlin as India -- a stalwart commercial ally throughout war -- shuns its fleet. At the same time, Ukraine has started blowing up Russian oil refineries, though it's not clear how much support for the strategy it enjoys in Washington.

""We're definitely seeing stepped up US sanctions pressure on both Russian crude and on exports,"" said Greg Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. ""It comes at a time when the US is struggling to send more aid to Ukraine, when Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield are starting to decline, and when Russia appears to be gaining the upper hand.""

State-run Sovcomflot transported about a fifth of all Russia's crude deliveries to India last year. The figure appeared to be in decline even before the news that nation's refineries would no longer accept the ships.

""We expect and welcome that global oil buyers will be much less willing to deal with Sovcomflot than in the past,"" a US Treasury spokesperson said, adding that the measures should have no oil market impact because Russia will maintain an incentive to sell oil.""

Now that fleet will need to find work elsewhere -- and there are signs it's struggling. At least seven of the vessels have come to a halt in the Black Sea and disappeared from digital monitoring systems, tanker tracking by Bloomberg shows. Sovcomflot admitted this week that sanctions had hurt its operations.

""The targeting of Sovcomflot represents a significant tightening of US sanctions against Russia,"" said Janis Kluge, senior associate for Eastern Europe and Eurasia at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ""It will not solve the problem of circumvention, but it will drive up shipping costs and price discounts for Russian oil.""

Even so, Russia can still draw on a so-called ""shadow fleet"" of vessels amassed shortly after the 2022 invasion -- often older ships without proper insurance and with unclear ownership -- to make its deliveries. By some estimates, there are as many as 600 such carriers in operation, alongside Greek tankers that continue to serve the trade under the G-7 price cap.

Delivery costs for Russian oil are huge. It costs about $14.50 a barrel to delivery a Baltic Sea cargo to China, according to data from Argus Media. Well over half that sum is attributable to sanctions, it estimates.

""Whether this turns into actual supply losses will depend on how quickly workarounds are found for freight issues and whether Russian sellers are willing to deepen discounts,"" said Bronze at Energy Aspects.

A further setback for Moscow has emerged in its sale of refined fuels. An average of 6.2 million barrels of Russian diesel was floating in the 10 days to March 17, according to data from Kpler That's the highest the measure's been since at least 2017.

While it's not clear that sanctions have caused the buildup, it's striking that so much product is accumulating at a time when drone strikes ought to have curbed supplies.

""Washington still has powerful tools to hurt Russian oil exports, but has used them cautiously, fearing a spike in gas prices in an election year,"" said Kluge.

Albany should act,"Assemblymember Patricia Fahy and state Sen. Liz Krueger's well thought-out and elegantly crafted NY Home Energy Affordable Transition (HEAT) Act is a popular bill that simultaneously leads to cleaner air and lower bills. This legislation is so popular that one assemblymember noted that she has received more emails in support of this bill than any other.

One provision of this bill kickstarts the implementation of the state's longtime goal of limiting households' energy burdens to 6% of earnings. Other provisions modernize the state's outdated utility laws that are leading to higher heating costs and carbon pollution and give the Public Service Commission -- the state agency that regulates utility corporations -- the necessary tools and authority to simultaneously address the energy affordability and climate crises. For example, the so-called ""100-foot rule,"" which Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed repealing in 2022, allows utilities to heavily subsidize fracked gas hookups and raise existing customers' rates to cover the costs -- a travesty that the legislature should have addressed years ago.

Gas utilities draw their profits almost entirely from installing new pipes or equipment to expand the gas network or to renew its aging segments. The costs and the built-in profit margins are added to utility bills, usually based on an anticipated 60 to 80 years of service life that the new pipes will never see, leaving ratepayers on the hook to continue paying for decades after the pipes are retired.

As gas bills rise and heat pumps buoyed by federal and state incentives gain popularity, many gas customers are switching to the superior electric alternatives. This trend will leave fewer customers to bear the growing costs of the gas distribution network. The resulting bill hikes will set a feedback loop as more customers defect and further raise the costs for those whose circumstances prevent them from making the switch.

Sky-high bills won't be the only reason why many New Yorkers would scramble to get off toxic fracked gas in the coming years. American Medical Association, American Lung Association, New York State Public Health Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and all state chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics deem gas stoves a health hazard. Almost 19% of all childhood asthma in New York can be attributed to gas stoves. In 2022, AARP warned its members of elevated dementia risk from exposure to pollution from gas stoves. Boilers and furnaces fired up during peak heating demand can make a neighborhood's air quality akin to that under a mini power plant's smokestack.

The so-called ""obligation to serve "" rule in the current law prevents customers on an end-of-life section of the gas network from collectively choosing modern clean and cost-effective heating options in lieu of exorbitant pipe replacement. A critical provision of the NY HEAT Act amends this obligation to democratize energy options for heating at the neighborhood level. It allows the PSC to approve pollution-free alternatives in ready and willing neighborhoods and to fund these alternatives through savings from the avoided new gas pipes -- a win-win for energy customers and the environment.

The full NY HEAT Act has passed in the state senate two years in a row. In the Assembly, 76 of the 150 members -- a majority -- are its cosponsors. Hochul's budget proposal includes some of the bill's key provisions, albeit without implementation timelines and the goal of 6% energy burden limit. It is a budget priority for the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Legislative Caucus. However, sensing a threat to their competition-free profits, gas utilities have employed misinformation and fear mongering -- decades old oil and gas industry tactics -- to spook a few assembly members into holding most of the bill hostage in the assembly.

Despite differences in stances on this bill's various provisions, the fact is that all major provisions work synergistically and are urgently needed. For example, amending the OTS lends credibility to the bill's energy affordability targets because every day without the OTS amendment adds millions of dollars of future bill liabilities for gas customers, undermining the state's affordability goals. In turn, codifying the 6% maximum energy burden goal not only provides much needed relief to families, but it also strengthens the OTS provision because it will help keep the PSC honest when it comes to deciding between cost-efficient options like geothermal or district heating and expensive pipe replacements for expensive gas.

Hopefully, Speaker Carl Heastie and the governor will prioritize the long-term energy affordability, health and well-being of New Yorkers over gas-utility profits and will include the entire bill in the final state budget.

These activities have created market dynamics that are affecting the price of individual cryptocurrencies on-chain. For context, Fantom (FTM) is gearing toward launching its Sonic Mainnet. Also, Celestia (TIA) is partnering with Polygon to create a gas-free future. Notably, KangaMoon (KANG), one of the top meme coins has entered stage 4 of presale amid surging momentum and a record number of investors inflow. Find out more below.

The presale phase of KangaMoon (KANG) is proving to be a massive success following the growth of the project in the crypto industry. For context, thousands of traders have bought the KANG's presale, which has raised over $2,281,975.999 so far. Notably, KANG has recorded over 180% growth since the start of its presale. This, in turn, translates to a 180% ROI for early investors of the KANG project.

Meanwhile, crypto analysts are expecting the KANG token to rise by over 800% within its presale. At the current price of just $0.014, buying the presale will be a top crypto investment alternative, given the token's massive growth potential. There's also a 10% presale bonus for traders who buy the token now. The team is also planning to list the token in a major Tier 1 CEX exchange in the coming weeks.

As a platform, KangaMoon is a play-to-earn ecosystem that facilitates on-chain gaming adventures with exciting rewards and earning capabilities. Also, the KangaMoon platform is an innovative meeting ground for meme enthusiasts through the SocialFi structure. Overall, KangaMoon is a hybrid of a top meme coin with strong utility and a platform for meme enthusiasts.

The Fantom (FTM) Sonic Mainnet is on the verge of launch, having concluded the audit from the testnet carried out months ago. For context, Fantom is aiming to upgrade its Mainnet to the Sonic protocol. So far, some upgrades have already been made, which saw a 95% reduction in the cost of running large-scale nodes on the Fantom ecosystem.

With the full launch of Sonic Mainnet set to launch in the coming weeks, the Fantom token has seen its price value rise significantly. For instance, the Fantom price has gained over 115% over the last month to be on the verge of reaching the $1 mark for the first time since November 2021.

PARIS, France, March 23, 2024/APO Group/ --

Antonio Oburu Ondo, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons of Equatorial Guinea, will speak at the upcoming Invest in African Energy (IAE) forum in Paris, as the country seeks renewed foreign investment to monetize offshore gas reserves and establish itself as an LNG export hub.

As a mature producer, Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing near-field, infrastructure-led exploration to yield new discoveries and bring additional resources into production. Trident Energy launched a three-well infill drilling campaign on Block G at the start of this year utilizing the Island Innovator rig, with all three wells expected to come onstream by mid-year. The rig will then drill the Akeng deep exploration well in Kosmos Energy-operated Block S, targeting potential resources of 180 million barrels of oil. If successful, the campaign could lead to a significant rise in output from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

IAE 2024 (https://apo-opa.co/49krKXM) is an exclusive forum designed to facilitate investment between African energy markets and global investors. Taking place May 14-15, 2024 in Paris, the event offers delegates two days of intensive engagement with industry experts, project developers, investors and policymakers. For more information, please visit www.Invest-Africa-Energy.com. To sponsor or participate as a delegate, please contact sales@energycapitalpower.com.

Meanwhile, VAALCO Energy is leading development of the Venus Field in Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea, which involves drilling two producer wells and one water injector under a single campaign. The Houston-based firm is planning to bring the project online in 2026, in partnership with national oil company GEPetrol and Atlas Petroleum. Holding interests in six blocks - including producing assets in Block I - Atlas Petroleum is currently seeking farm-in and drilling partners in Blocks EG-02 and H, in which extensive 3D seismic surveys have suggested significant hydrocarbon-bearing potential.

Attracting new players to its exploration scene, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons signed three production sharing contracts last year with Africa Oil Corp. (Block EG-18 and EG-31) and Panoro Energy (EG-01), and expects to sign another for the development of Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 in the coming months. In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil & Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

""Equatorial Guinea is doubling down on gas - a key focal point of the global energy transition and investor interest. The country is single-handedly driving one of the most ambitious LNG initiatives on the continent - the GMH - which holds the potential to establish an intra-African gas trade and catalyze gas-based industries across the region. At IAE 2024, global investors can access Equatorial Guinea's latest investment prospects, as well as interface with the country's relevant oil and gas authorities,"" says Sandra Jeque, Event & Project Director at Energy Capital & Power.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.3254901960784313,448880022,1,,

Further east, an overnight drone attack on the Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery, the latest in a series of strikes against Russia's fuel industry.

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the facade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

In the Samara region - 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away from the front lines in eastern -- the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, governor Dmitry Azarov said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

The refinery, run by Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tonnes per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy site and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fire at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for over two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

And Russia has also launched a barrage of what it calls ""retaliatory"" attacks, targeting Ukraine's energy sector and the capital Kyiv in recent days.",vanguardngr.com,news,Vanguard,,-0.5607843137254902,448879997,1,https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Russia-oil-refinery.jpg,

Imported coal is blended with coal from domestic mines to increase its calorific value.

There has been a reduction of 36.69 per cent in the volume of coal imported for blending by thermal power plants, amounting to 19.36 million tons (MT) during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the same period of the previous year, the Coal Ministry said on Friday.

This reduction in imported coal for blending signifies a shift towards utilising domestic coal, thus reducing reliance on imports. Imported coal is blended with coal from domestic mines to increase its calorific value.

Conversely, there has been a notable increase of 94.21 per cent in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. These power plants are designed to run only on imported coal, and the growth in imports has been spurred by the sharp decline in international prices of the fuel.

India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54 per cent and 38 per cent respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Overall there has been a reduction in the share of coal import in the total coal consumption in the country. The share of coal import declined to 21 per cent during April 2023 to January 2024, which was 22.48 per cent during the corresponding period of previous year, according to the Coal Ministry statement.

Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278 per cent in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82 per cent during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24.

Computable General Equilibrium models have been used to assess the economic consequences of greenhouse gas policies. The focus is mainly on the Swedish economy, but the EU economies and the global economies are also analyzed in one essay each. The costs and effects of a unilateral Swedish decision to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are analyzed in essay I. The results of a unilateral reduction are compared to the results of an implementation of an EU multilateral agreement. The results indicate that if Sweden unilaterally decides to increase its CO2 tax, total EU CO2 emissions will increase, i.e. there will be a ""carbon leakage effect"". Furthermore, an EU multilateral implementation of a CO2 tax will induce lower welfare (excluding environmental benefits) in Sweden, as compared to the situation where the same tax is unilaterally introduced.In the second essay we analyze the Swedish environmental goals conforming to the Kyoto Protocol, when simultaneously meeting national goals to alleviate acidification and eutrofication effects by reducing SO2 and NOx pollutants. We have found that when secondary benefits of measures aiming at reducing CO2 are taken into account, it may still be in the government's interest to nationally decrease CO2, instead of engaging in seemingly low-cost trading. The principles for allocation emission permits are many, and in the third essay I focus on principles based on economic welfare theory. My main conclusion from these simulation exercises is that the distribution rule based on the different assumptions on social welfare function and some other more ad hoc distribution rules offers quite large changes in welfare, distributions of emission rights and contrary to earlier literature, I find that the initial distribution not only gives second-order effects but affects equilibrium prices and therefore, income.In the fourth essay I focus on how households' demand for transport services can be improved in CGE-models. A differentiation between trip purposes and trip length, a complementary relationship between work journeys and labor supply, and a subdivision of households by density of population and income, influences the numerical results in a direction increasing the negative welfare effect of a carbon target, as compared to the non-extended model.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1529411764705881,448879384,1,,

International benchmark Brent crude traded at $87.03 per barrel at 10.46 a.m. local time (0746 GMT), a 0.40% decrease from the closing price of $87.38 per barrel in the previous trading session.

The American benchmark West Texas Intermediate traded at $82.44 per barrel at the same time, a 0.35% fall from the previous session that closed at $82.73 per barrel.

Oil prices decreased in early trade on Wednesday due to uncertainty over the US Fed's upcoming monetary decision that will be announced later in the day.

Although it is predicted that the Fed will maintain the policy rate, the path that the markets take is anticipated to be influenced by indicators from the policy text and a statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

According to analysts, the latest macroeconomic data is likely to fuel inflationary concerns. Therefore, clues about how the Fed assesses these statistics will be crucial for determining the course of action to be taken in the near future.

With the Fed expected to maintain the policy rate for now, oil prices are set to be suppressed as high interest rates boost the value of the US dollar, making oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

On Wednesday, the US dollar index increased by 0.56% to 103.54, deterring more expensive oil trade and curtailing price rises on the back of profit-taking from higher prices at the beginning of the week.

Further price reductions could be restricted if US Energy Information Administration data later on Wednesday shows a stock drawdown below estimates.

The hemodynamic impact of different aortic nozzle (D) and atrial discharge (D) sizes was investigated by incorporating each VEP prototype into the Fontan mock flow loop. The results in this section correspond to the EXP NO (I) in Table 1. The introduction of the VEP into the circulation resulted in a drop in arterial blood pressure (ABP) due to the presence of the aortic graft that draws a fraction of the cardiac output. To maintain hemodynamic homeostasis in the event of reduced blood pressure, the arterial baroreceptor reflex would regulate the ABP by increasing the SVR and CO, the two primary control mechanisms affecting ABP. This study assumes that the regulation of ABP is controlled by the CO since the interrelation between SVR and CO response is not quantitatively known. More importantly, this would reveal the least efficient performance of VEP full assist since an increase in SVR would result in a lower increase in CO, and consequently lower venous pressure rise and better performance. Please refer to Supplementary Material for more details on this assumption. For this purpose, the reduced ABP was adjusted back to its TCPC-state condition (both MAP and pulse pressure) by incrementally increasing the CO and monitoring the aortic pressure without changing the SVR. The CO adjustment was achieved by increasing the stroke volume and keeping the heart rate identical to its TCPC-state value (70 bpm).

The instantaneous variation of pressure and flow waveforms for the VEP with a D of 2.5 mm and D of 5 mm is provided in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, for TCPC-state, TCPC + VEP acute, and TCPC + VEP full assist conditions with a TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min. TCPC + VEP acute represents the immediate hemodynamic response after VEP inclusion into the mock circulation without any hemodynamic adjustment. The activation of VEP remarkedly changed the venous pressure and flow waveforms with a significant improvement in the pulsatility levels. Clearly, the phase shift between aortic and venous pressure present at the TCPC-state almost vanishes during VEP-assisted circulation as the highly pulsatile AoG flow dominates. During the systolic phase, the pressure dynamics in the IVC and SVC exhibit complex interplay that reflects the underlying hemodynamic forces. As the aortic pressure increases during systole, a corresponding increase in AoG flow ensues as it is driven by the arterial-venous pressure gradient. Consequently, the SVC pressure rises due to the impingement of IVC and SVC flows, while the IVC pressure shows a slight initial rise followed by a sharp drop. The AoG flow and IVC pressure interplay is governed by two competing effects, both arising from the increased AoG flow. The first effect, driven by the increased pulmonary flow (PVR-effect), results in an increased IVC pressure due to the greater back pressure, as the PVR remains constant. The second effect is due to greater jet flow momentum transfer to the IVC section (Venturi-effect), leading to stronger Venturi effects and consequently lower pressure levels. Thus, the PVR-effect predominates during the initial phase of the systole, justifying the slight increase in the IVC pressure.

The mean arterial pressure experienced a reduction of 32%, 42%, 48%, and 52% during VEP acute mode with aortic nozzle diameters of 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, and 3.5 mm, respectively, with a TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min. The aortic pressure during VEP acute mode was higher (~ 10%) in the case of the TCPC-state CO of 3.5 L/min as compared to 2.4 L/min. These results correspond to the AD graft size of 5 mm; however, the values were almost identical for other diameters. The sample VEP-assisted venous pressure waveforms for various aortic nozzle sizes are provided in Fig. 6 for an AD graft size of 5 mm and TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min. The summary of key Fontan hemodynamic indices is illustrated in Fig. 7. The systemic flow rate during the full-assist was in the range of 2.3-2.4 L/min and 3.4-3.5 L/min for TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min and 3.5 L/min, respectively, almost identical to pre-VEP values. Larger aortic nozzle sizes resulted in higher venous pressure levels but with similar waveform patterns. As the nozzle grows larger, given that the AoG flow is purely driven by the arterial-venous pressure gradient, an increase in AoG flow ensues due to lower resistance. Obviously, the PVR-effect of an increased AoG flow predominates, leading to higher venous pressure levels. However, a significant increase in the isolated Venturi-effect was observed as the nozzle became larger by looking at the inferior cavopulmonary pressure head. More importantly, an average pulmonary pulse pressure of 1.06 mm Hg, 1.25 mm Hg, 1.50 mm Hg, and 1.63 mm Hg was observed during full assist with aortic nozzle diameters of 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, and 3.5 mm, respectively, which is a significant improvement compared to TCPC-state pulmonary pulse pressure of 0.38 mm Hg. The values were averaged for different AD sizes and cardiac outputs as they exhibited minimal impact on pulmonary pulsatility. The AoG flow rate was found to be independent of AD size and TCPC-state CO, owing to virtually the same values of the arterial-venous pressure gradient. This also justifies the lower drop in MAP during acute response for higher TCPC-state CO, as identical AoG flow rate results in lower flow percentage drawn from the systemic circulation and consequently higher MAP levels. The impingement of IVC and SVC flows led to higher SVC pressure values for larger nozzle diameters. Nozzle diameters of 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm almost did not cause any SVC pressure elevation as compared to TCPC-state.

Expectedly, larger AD sizes boosted the IVC and SVC pressure drop but at the expense of lower arterial oxygen saturation and pulmonary flow. Excluding the nozzle size of 3.5 mm with the TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min, a positive correlation is observed between arterial oxygen saturation and the nozzle size. Higher AoG flow enhances the oxygen level in the AD flow but also causes more arterial desaturation as a result of increased AD flow, explaining the drop in oxygen levels in the aforementioned case (D: 3.5 mm, CO: 2.4 L/min). Finally, CO exhibited a positive linear relationship with the aortic nozzle size, indicating higher ventricular load for larger nozzles. The ratio of CO over systemic flow was higher than the physiological threshold of 1.5 for aortic nozzle diameters of 3.0 mm and 3.5 mm, which is associated with a high risk of ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular volume overload. However, the ratio was strongly dependent on the TCPC-state CO as the aforementioned nozzle sizes did not exceed the physiological threshold in the case of TCPC-state CO of 3.5 L/min.

The summary of important Fontan hemodynamic indices in the event of VEP failure is illustrated in Fig. 8a,b for AoG and AD failure modes, respectively. The VEP was successful in maintaining low venous pressure levels but at the expense of significantly lower oxygen saturation during AoG failure mode. Atrial discharge diameters of 6 mm and 7 mm led to oxygen saturations significantly lower than 80% in the case of a TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min which is considered dangerously low. However, the oxygen saturation was strongly dependent on the CO as in the case of TCPC-state CO of 3.5 L/min, the aforementioned AD sizes maintained oxygen saturation levels higher than 80%. The occluded AoG failure mode exemplifies the conventional Fontan circulation with fenestrated hemodynamics. In the presence of AoG occlusion, the Fontan pressure registers lower compared to the full assist mode, owing to reduced pulmonary flow and a constant PVR. Conversely, in full assist mode, arterial oxygen saturation experiences a significant rise, albeit with a marginal reduction in IVC pressure drop. Ergo, the primary objective of the AoG graft is to maximize arterial oxygen saturation while minimizing the elevation in Fontan pressure due to increased pulmonary flow.

In the event of AD failure mode, venous pressure is the key hemodynamic index to monitor since no arterial oxygen desaturation exists. Considerable elevation in both IVC and SVC pressure levels was observed as compared to TCPC-state condition, which was positively correlated to aortic nozzle size and negatively correlated to TCPC-state CO. IVC pressure exhibited a lower elevation as compared to SVC due to the presence of jet Venturi effect. The pulmonary flow was significantly boosted as compared to both full-assist and TCPC-state conditions and the AoG flow was slightly lower than the full-assist mode. It is worth mentioning that PVR in these results was held constant and identical to its TCPC-state level. However, evidence of a negative correlation between PVR and pulmonary flow has been reported in the literature. Although the quantitative data are limited, Schmitt et al. reported that a dobutamine-induced exercise condition with an increase in pulmonary flow was followed by a drop in PVR. The PVR percentage change was approximately in the range of 30-50%. To evaluate the impact of PVR drop in the event of AD failure mode, we assumed that the percentage drop in PVR is proportional to the percentage increase in pulmonary flow (as compared to TCPC-state condition) as long as it is lower than 50%. For higher pulmonary flow increase percentages, the PVR drop was assumed to stay at 50%. Table 2 summarizes the venous pressure data before and after the PVR change for the case with TCPC-state CO of 2.4 L/min. The IVC pressure exhibited a significant drop to levels lower than TCPC-state values for all nozzle sizes. The SVC, however, experienced a slight elevation in pressure which was varying based on aortic nozzle size. The SVC pressure rise was less than 0.5 mm Hg for the VEP with aortic nozzle sizes of 2 mm and 2.5 mm.

Two VEP prototypes with AD graft size of 5 mm and aortic nozzle sizes of 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm were selected and named VEP1 and VEP2, respectively. The selection was based on the hemodynamic indices presented in Section ""Impact of geometrical parameters and cardiac output"". AD graft sizes larger than 5 mm resulted in low arterial oxygen saturation levels (< 80%) in the event of AoG failure mode. More importantly, aortic nozzle diameters larger than 2.5 mm led to CO over systemic flow ratios higher than the physiological limit of 1.5, and thus, were not selected. The results in this section correspond to the EXP NO (II) in Table 1. Figure 9 summarizes the hemodynamic indices for various MAP. Mean aortic pressure was adjusted by tuning the SVR and keeping other physiological parameters unchanged. Higher MAP values improved performance by reducing IVC pressure and increasing oxygen saturation but with a slight elevation in SVC pressure. A change in MAP from 65 mm Hg to 105 mm Hg resulted in an average drop of 0.25 mm Hg in IVC pressure and an average increase of 1.45 mm Hg in SVC pressure over all cases. VEP1 maintained SVC pressure levels lower than those in the TCPC-state condition for all MAP values. Although cardiac output increased for higher MAP values, the ratio of cardiac output over systemic flow for both prototypes did not exceed the limit of 1.5 under any conditions.

Figure 10 presents a depiction of the VEP1 performance concerning diverse ECC sizes and TPG values in idealized TCPC models. The results in this section correspond to the EXP NO (III) in Table 1. An inverse relationship between ECC size and IVC pressure drop was evident. Specifically, an increase in ECC size from 13 to 20 mm resulted in reductions of 1.30 mm Hg and 1.35 mm Hg in IVC pressure drop for TCPC-state CO values of 2.4 L/min and 3.5 L/min, respectively, with a TPG of 10 mm Hg. This reduction in IVC pressure drop can be attributed to decreased jet momentum transfer in the presence of larger ECC sizes. In contrast, parameters such as cardiac output, pulmonary flow, and SVC pressure remained largely unaffected and exhibited minimal variations. Arterial oxygen saturation values were consistently maintained above 85% for all ECC sizes and TPG values; however, a slight decline was observed as the ECC size increased. Moreover, the TPG had a notable influence on VEP1 performance. Elevated TPG values led to increased IVC pressure drop and atrial discharge flow but concurrently resulted in lower arterial oxygen saturation levels and pulmonary flow. These findings highlight the intricate interplay of ECC size and TPG in shaping VEP performance within the TCPC environment.

To evaluate the VEP performance under different heart rates, VEP1 with an ECC size of 18 mm was employed. Three heart rates of 50, 70, and 90 bpm were considered to encompass a broad range of potential variability. The results in this section correspond to the EXP NO (IV) in Table 1. Figure 11 depicts the instantaneous aortic and venous pressure waveforms during full-assist mode for each heart rate. Complementary to this, Table 3 provides a summary of cycle-averaged hemodynamic quantities. Observations revealed that higher heart rates corresponded to sharper venous pressure waveforms. While the heart rate influenced the instantaneous variations of venous pressure and other hemodynamic indices, the cycle-averaged quantities remained virtually unchanged. This underscores the insignificant impact of heart rate on VEP performance, indicating robust stability across varying heart rates.

Table 4 presents a summary of VEP1-assisted Fontan hemodynamics obtained using a patient-specific TCPC model. The results in this section correspond to the EXP NO (V) in Table 1. Notably, the performance observed in this patient-specific model closely resembles that of the idealized TCPC with an identical ECC size of 16 mm. This demonstrates the minor influence of TCPC complexity on VEP performance, highlighting the robustness and consistency of VEP performance across different TCPC configurations.",nature.com,news,Nature,,-0.1686274509803921,448879161,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-57269-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_57269_Fig1_HTML.png,

Brent futures for May delivery settled at $85.43, losing 35 cents. U.S. crude settled at $80.63 a barrel, falling 44 cents. Both benchmarks logged less than 1% change on the week.

""Everyone is watching for what the weekend will bring with Gaza,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC, adding that successful peace talks would prompt Yemen's Houthi rebels to allow oil tankers to pass through the Red Sea.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Blinken met Arab foreign ministers and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo as negotiators in Qatar centred on a truce of about six weeks.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was set for a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's surprise interest rate cut on Thursday bolstered global risk sentiment.

A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies, dampening demand.

While a possible ceasefire meant crude might move more freely globally, a lower U.S. oil rig count and the potential for easing U.S. interest rates helped support prices.

U.S. equities, which tend to move in correlation with oil prices, hit record highs after the Federal Reserve ended its regular meeting with no change in U.S. rates on Wednesday.

As a mature producer, Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing near-field, infrastructure-led exploration to yield new discoveries and bring additional resources into production. Trident Energy launched a three-well infill drilling campaign on Block G at the start of this year utilizing the Island Innovator rig, with all three wells expected to come onstream by mid-year. The rig will then drill the Akeng deep exploration well in Kosmos Energy-operated Block S, targeting potential resources of 180 million barrels of oil. If successful, the campaign could lead to a significant rise in output from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

IAE 2024 (https://apo-opa.co/49krKXM) is an exclusive forum designed to facilitate investment between African energy markets and global investors. Taking place May 14-15, 2024 in Paris, the event offers delegates two days of intensive engagement with industry experts, project developers, investors and policymakers. For more information, please visit www.Invest-Africa-Energy.com. To sponsor or participate as a delegate, please contact sales@energycapitalpower.com.

Meanwhile, VAALCO Energy is leading development of the Venus Field in Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea, which involves drilling two producer wells and one water injector under a single campaign. The Houston-based firm is planning to bring the project online in 2026, in partnership with national oil company GEPetrol and Atlas Petroleum. Holding interests in six blocks - including producing assets in Block I - Atlas Petroleum is currently seeking farm-in and drilling partners in Blocks EG-02 and H, in which extensive 3D seismic surveys have suggested significant hydrocarbon-bearing potential.

Attracting new players to its exploration scene, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons signed three production sharing contracts last year with Africa Oil Corp. (Block EG-18 and EG-31) and Panoro Energy (EG-01), and expects to sign another for the development of Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 in the coming months. In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil&Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

As a mature producer, Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing near-field, infrastructure-led exploration to yield new discoveries and bring additional resources into production. Trident Energy launched a three-well infill drilling campaign on Block G at the start of this year utilizing the Island Innovator rig, with all three wells expected to come onstream by mid-year. The rig will then drill the Akeng deep exploration well in Kosmos Energy-operated Block S, targeting potential resources of 180 million barrels of oil. If successful, the campaign could lead to a significant rise in output from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

IAE 2024 (https://apo-opa.co/49krKXM) is an exclusive forum designed to facilitate investment between African energy markets and global investors.

Meanwhile, VAALCO Energy is leading development of the Venus Field in Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea, which involves drilling two producer wells and one water injector under a single campaign. The Houston-based firm is planning to bring the project online in 2026, in partnership with national oil company GEPetrol and Atlas Petroleum. Holding interests in six blocks - including producing assets in Block I - Atlas Petroleum is currently seeking farm-in and drilling partners in Blocks EG-02 and H, in which extensive 3D seismic surveys have suggested significant hydrocarbon-bearing potential.

Attracting new players to its exploration scene, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons signed three production sharing contracts last year with Africa Oil Corp. (Block EG-18 and EG-31) and Panoro Energy (EG-01), and expects to sign another for the development of Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 in the coming months. In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil&Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

The recall notice states that 286 examples of the Suzuki Jimny in Queensland have been affected, which were manufactured between 2018 and 2019. The company stated that a potential fault with the fuel pump on the SUV was likely.

The recall notice filed with the Department of Infrastructure in Queensland stated that the fuel pump impeller may swell and cause the fuel pump to stop working, due to a manufacturing defect. This could result in a loss of power on the off-roader.

It needs to be noted that Suzuki Queensland is separate from Suzuki Australia, and is responsible for Suzuki cars imported and sold in the state. This does mean that Suzuki Australia could issue a separate recall for the Jimny 3-door for the same issue. Suzuki Queensland further said that it will be contacting customers of the affected vehicles and will schedule a service appointment to have the fuel pump replaced free of charge.

More recently, Maruti Suzuki also issued a recall in India for the Baleno and WagonR for a faulty fuel pump issue. Over 16,000 units were affected by either model and were manufactured in 2019 as well. The Suzuki Jimny for Australia is exported from India including the three-door version.

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region as well as the regional capital, also called Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said.

""As a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,"" he said.

He posted a photo of a residential building with the facade partially destroyed.

Another person was killed in a drone attack on districts outside the city, he said.

In the Samara region - 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away from the front lines in eastern -- the local governor reported ""several drone attacks"" on local oil refineries.

One of them caused a fire at the Kuibyshev refinery, governor Dmitry Azarov said in a statement on Telegram, noting that there were no casualties.

The refinery, run by Russian oil giant Rosneft, is one of the largest in the region, with a production capacity of seven million tonnes per year, according to its official website.

A drone attack on another refinery in the region, Novokuibyshevsk, ""was repelled without damaging the technological equipment"", Azarov said.

The attacks came 24 hours after Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial barrages of the two-year conflict, hitting dozens of Ukrainian energy site and leaving more than a million temporarily without power.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed 31 of 34 Russian drones fire at its territory overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 12 Ukrainian drones.

Ukraine, which has been facing a Russian offensive for over two years, has stepped up its attacks inside Russia in recent weeks, targeting energy sites in particular.

Jessica Williams, 34, had burns on 70% of her body and spent a month in a coma after her home in Seven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot, was reduced to rubble in 2020.

On Friday night, Jess was named higher apprentice of the year for her work as a pre-school leader at Ser Bach y Cwm nursery in Ystradgynlais.

The Welsh government organised the event, which was supported by the National Training Federation for Wales (NTFW).

Mother-of-two Jessica fought back from her life-changing injuries to achieve a higher apprenticeship in children's care and build a successful career.

""My journey has not been an easy one, but it has been incredible,"" she said.

""I have gone from being critically ill and fighting for my life to becoming a successful pre-school leader.""

In the explosion in June 2020, a fridge fell on top of Jessica wedging her against a wall.

Rubble collapsed in on the house, and her two sons, aged five and two at the time, had burns on about 28% of their bodies.

She said the traumatic experience changed her life and added that the apprenticeship - delivered by ACT Training - had enabled her to flourish and build a successful career.

Christine Bissex-Foster, chairwoman of the judging panel of Apprenticeship Awards Cymru, said there had been more than 180 applications for the 2024 awards.

""This year's applications are a reflection of the extraordinary potential in Wales; they are of a very high standard,"" she said.

""The winners and finalists have established a new benchmark for vocational education in Wales, and I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to everyone involved.""

Among the other winners was Needle Rock, an upholstery business established by Dr Ali J Wright in Llanrhystud near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion.

By starting the venture in 2013, Dr Wright - a former UK government plant health inspector - has turned her hobby of rescuing old furniture into a flourishing business which employs four people.

This pumping station has a 90-horsepower capacity and is powered by a 115-kilowatt solar farm.

It operates three 30HP pumps, discharging 225 litres per second and covering 125 hectares of rice fields.

Governor Zulum emphasized a shift in focus from short-term food distribution to supporting farming activities in the state.

He expressed the need for sustainable solutions like agriculture rather than continuously providing food aid and housing internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Additionally, the governor launched the sale of subsidized petrol at N500 per litre to assist farmers during the dry season.

This initiative aims to provide 1 million litres of petrol across all local government areas in the state to support irrigation activities.

""I want to announce that for this year's irrigation activities, the government of Borneo State is to procure 1 million litres of petrol and distribute it in the entire state at a subsidised rate to farmers,"" Zulum said.

Furthermore, Governor Zulum distributed agricultural inputs to 4,500 farmers in Damasak and surrounding areas.

""This morning, we are flagging off the distribution of dry-season farm inputs to farmers in northern Borno. 4,500 farmers have benefited from fertilisers, agrochemicals and water-pumping machines,"" Zulum said.

These inputs included fertilizers, water pumping machines (both solar-powered and petrol-powered), agrochemicals, and accessories.

The governor inspected various farms in Damasak and highlighted the expansion of the Nglayi scheme from 500 to over 1500 hectares.

The Commissioner for Agriculture, Engr Bawu Musami, praised Governor Zulum's achievements in agriculture, citing the establishment of modern irrigation schemes across different local government areas.

In Block 27 - home to the untapped Fortuna gas field - GEPetrol is seeking $3.1 billion to develop more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. Last December, Europa Oil & Gas acquired an interest in the highly prospective Block EG-08, which features drill-ready prospects and estimated resources of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.

The country is also entering the next phases of development of its flagship Gas Mega Hub (GMH) initiative, which seeks to leverage existing infrastructure to create a regional gas industry. Phase two consists of modifying the contractual terms for the Alba gas field, while phase three will facilitate gas processing from the offshore Aseng field at Punta Europa. Last October, Marathon Oil signed an LNG sale agreement with multinational commodity trader Glencore for gas produced from the Alba field. Marathon is also planning to modify its integrated gas operations in Equatorial Guinea in 2024, which includes rerouting natural gas from the AMPCO methanol facility to the EG LNG plant.

""Equatorial Guinea is doubling down on gas - a key focal point of the global energy transition and investor interest. The country is single-handedly driving one of the most ambitious LNG initiatives on the continent - the GMH - which holds the potential to establish an intra-African gas trade and catalyze gas-based industries across the region. At IAE 2024, global investors can access Equatorial Guinea's latest investment prospects, as well as interface with the country's relevant oil and gas authorities,"" says Sandra Jeque, Event & Project Director at Energy Capital & Power.",energycapitalandpower.africa-newsroom.com,news,energycapitalandpower.africa-newsroom.com,,0.3960784313725489,448877128,1,https://energycapitalandpower.africa-newsroom.com/files/large/bc97bda5e3bfa79,eng-9419816

In the bustling world of football, tales of triumph and turmoil often intersect, weaving a narrative that extends beyond the pitch. Manchester United's Brandon Williams once heralded as a rising star in the club's illustrious academy, finds himself entangled in a web of controversy, thrust into the spotlight for reasons far removed from his prowess with the ball at his feet.

The recent revelation of Williams' involvement in a high-speed car crash, coupled with allegations of inhaling nitrous oxide, has sent shockwaves through the footballing community. As the courtroom drama unfolds, the glare of the public eye scrutinizes every detail, dissecting the life of a promising talent veering dangerously off course.

At just 23 years old, Williams stands at a precarious crossroads, his future hanging in the balance as legal proceedings loom large. The prosecution paints a damning picture, detailing how the young defender purportedly drove his Audi A3 S Line at breakneck speeds along the A34 in Wilmslow, Cheshire, before careening into a collision at 74mph. Witnesses recount glimpses of Williams partaking in the inhalation of nitrous oxide, adding another layer of complexity to an already harrowing narrative.

As the courtroom drama unfolds, Williams maintains his innocence, vehemently denying charges of dangerous driving and refuting claims of impairment. Clad in a somber suit, he faces the magistrate with a stoic demeanor, a stark juxtaposition to the tumultuous events that have thrust him into the public eye.

For Manchester United, a storied institution steeped in tradition, Williams' plight is a stark reminder of the fragility of talent and the perils that lurk beyond the confines of the football pitch. Amidst the fervent support of fans and the unwavering scrutiny of pundits, the club navigates turbulent waters, grappling with the tarnishing of one of its own.

Williams' journey from the hallowed halls of Manchester United's academy to the courtroom's unforgiving glare underscores the pitfalls accompanying fame and fortune. Despite amassing 51 appearances for the first team, his trajectory has been marred by detours and setbacks, from loan spells at Norwich City to a recent stint at Ipswich Town.

As the legal saga unfolds, questions linger over the future of a once-promising talent. Will Williams emerge unscathed, poised for redemption on the footballing stage? Or will the weight of controversy prove too burdensome, casting a shadow over his fledgling career?

In the wake of Williams' ordeal, football clubs across the nation confront the sobering reality of substance abuse among players. Nitrous oxide, once viewed as a fleeting indulgence, now stands as a symbol of the inherent risks accompanying fame and fortune. With the specter of addiction looming large, clubs like Manchester United are forced to reckon with the implications, implementing rigorous testing regimens in a bid to safeguard their players' well-being.

As the dust settles on Brandon Williams' tumultuous saga, one thing remains clear: the road to redemption is fraught with challenges and obstacles. For Manchester United and its embattled defender, the journey ahead promises to be a test of resilience and fortitude, a quest to reclaim lost glory amidst adversity.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Fahad Hamid,0.04313725490196085,448877125,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manchester_United_news_Star_inhales_laughing_gas_before_suffering_car_crash_in_Saudi_Arabia.jpg,

We had trouble with both entities just after moving to Maine in 1988. Built two homes with baseboard electric heat and was told by a CMP field engineer that we were stupid to go with electric heat. This was long before the new green energy fad, so all us electric people using baseboard heat were ahead of the curve when it came to zero carbon emissions. CMP and the PUC were so anti-electric heat that we were hit with a 12% luxury tax and to make things worse were given a TOU meter which is a punitive meter because we used more than 2000-KW in one month.

Now to my gripe. Got a flyer from CMP stating that heat pump users may get a special rate. What about us loyal electric heat people who have paid dearly for heat with no complaints? I lived in a state where the power company had a special rate for all electric homes. But not in Maine. I never saw such a company that punishes you for being carbon neutral, plus CMP is the only business where the more you use they give you a discount? Of course not! Gone are the good old days when David Flanagan was president of CMP and Steve Ward was public advocate.

Hopefully my letter wakes up some of our legislators and pushes CMP and PUC to treat all electric heat homeowners more fairly.

The event attended by international leaders, politicians, diplomats, promises diverse perspectives.

Russian media reports reveal the aftermath of drone strikes in Belgorod, with the ""Mont Blanc"" business center among the damaged high-rise buildings.

Furthermore, UAVs targeted the Oskol electrometallurgical plant, leading to loud explosions and harrowing scenes captured by residents on video.

Despite the intensity of the attacks, the company's press service confirmed no casualties or significant damage at the plant, which serves as a key supplier to Russia's defense industry.

These strikes come amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with Kyiv ramping up retaliatory attacks on Russian soil, particularly focusing on energy sites. The US reportedly urged Kyiv to cease its strikes on Russian oil refineries, citing concerns about soaring crude prices and potential reprisals.

The timing of these events coincides with a flurry of successful Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities, just ahead of Russia's recent presidential election.

Given that the architects of the PIA still maintain authority, it is a tool wielded by the masterminds to maintain their stranglehold on the nation's resources, resembling a situation where 'the fox guards the hen house.' While the complicity of those involved in this charade is reprehensible, it behoves on Nigerians to rise against this tyranny of deception and to dismantle this facade of deceit.

In the corridors of power, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was hailed as the panacea to Nigeria's oil sector woes - a landmark legislation promising transparency, accountability, and fair distribution of the nation's oil wealth. Yet, as the dust settles, it reveals a disconcerting reality of promises not meant to be fulfilled.

Running the NNPC Ltd Like a Fiefdom

Let's do a quick refresher, according to the latest data from both the US Energy Information Administration. Nigeria is ranked eleventh in the world and fourth in Africa in crude oil production as at September 2023, with an average of 1.14 million barrels per day. While its crude oil production quota approved by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for December 2023 was 1.72 million barrels/day. No figures could be traced or anchored to the NNPC Limited within the same period.

The four government-owned refineries in Nigeria, built between 1965 and 1989, have all been shut down for several years due to, chief amongst them, structural neglect. Their total refining capacity is 445,000 barrels/day. Data provided by KNOEMA, a global data platform, shows the daily consumption of 520,000 barrels/day in December 2023.

Data available as at 2019 shows that about 43 licences were granted for large and modular refineries, out of which only about four modular refineries may be operational, with a total capacity of 34,000 barrels/day to grow to 135,000 barrels/day.

The Dangote Refinery costs $19 billion and was commissioned in 2023, but it is yet to start full operations and has a production capacity for 650,000 barrels/day. Through 'Project Bison', the NNPC, and not through the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), has audaciously gone ahead to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the refinery for $2.76 billion, and to rub salt on the injury, will also deliver 300,000 barrels/day of crude to Dangote at a discount and would forfeit 100 per cent of the dividend that will be declared within the repayment period.

In addition, 'Project Gazelle', a loan of $3.2 billion, was collected from AFREXIM bank to fund the Federal Government's dollar liquidity crisis, while its repayment will be from crude oil.

Despite owning about 130,000 barrels/day of oil from Dangote, NNPC chose to squander $1.5 billion in 2021 on renovating the antiquated Port Harcourt refinery, which lacks readily available spare parts. The renovation project is expected to take 44 months (until July 2024) and the first phase of the progress is unknown. The conditions of the other three refineries are also unclear.

Who Owns the Oil?

Nigeria is supposed to use its God-given oil revenue for various purposes, including funding the federal, state and local government budgets; investing in infrastructure, education, health, agriculture; and saving for future generations. However, the management of oil revenue in Nigeria has been plagued and besieged by fiscal indiscipline, corruption, misallocation, and inefficiency, resulting in poor development outcomes and welfare.

According to Wikipedia, Nigeria's Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) that is meant to save and invest some of the oil revenue for future generations, as well as to stabilise the economy during oil price shocks, was established in 2011 with an initial capital of $1 billion, and had $2.3 billion in it as at June 2023, which is a paltry $1.3 billion increment after 12 years. It will be interesting to know how much was squandered on salaries and perks of office within those 12 years.

What is disconcerting is that NNPC Ltd remitted $2.7 billion to its CBN accounts from January to June 2022, with $645 million from NLNG dividends and $1.786 billion from operational activities, predating the PIB's enactment. Post-PIB, the remittance details have been elusive. Remember, the PIB purportedly seeks to overhaul the oil sector, establish new regulations, and transform NNPC into a transparent limited liability company for improved efficiency. Yet, transparency regarding post-PIB remittances remains uncertain.

A Scam on Nigerians

Nigerians were presented with an albeit flimsy rationale for restructuring the NNPC, citing:

Here Enters the PIA

The 2021 Petroleum Industry Act, identified as Gazette No.142, comprises five chapters, 319 sections, and eight schedules. It addresses very distressing, disconcerting, frightening and upsetting issues that will impact over 200 million Nigerians, including the Domestic Base Price and Pricing Framework, Gas Price Formula for Gas-Based Industries, Capital and Production Allowances, Petroleum Fees, Rents, Royalty, and allocations to Host Communities and Frontier Basins. Due to space constraints, a detailed analysis of these provisions is not feasible here, but their implications are significant and wide-reaching for the populace.

Given that the architects of the PIA still maintain authority, it is a tool wielded by the masterminds to maintain their stranglehold on the nation's resources, resembling a situation where 'the fox guards the hen house.' While the complicity of those involved in this charade is reprehensible, it behoves on Nigerians to rise against this tyranny of deception and to dismantle this facade of deceit.

Jessica Williams, 34, had burns on 70% of her body and spent a month in a coma after her home in Seven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot, was reduced to rubble in 2020.

On Friday night, Jess was named higher apprentice of the year for her work as a pre-school leader at Ser Bach y Cwm nursery in Ystradgynlais.

The Welsh government organised the event, which was supported by the National Training Federation for Wales (NTFW).

Mother-of-two Jessica fought back from her life-changing injuries to achieve a higher apprenticeship in children's care and build a successful career.

""My journey has not been an easy one, but it has been incredible,"" she said.

""I have gone from being critically ill and fighting for my life to becoming a successful pre-school leader.""

In the explosion in June 2020, a fridge fell on top of Jessica wedging her against a wall.

Rubble collapsed in on the house, and her two sons, aged five and two at the time, had burns on about 28% of their bodies.

She said the traumatic experience changed her life and added that the apprenticeship - delivered by ACT Training - had enabled her to flourish and build a successful career.

Christine Bissex-Foster, chairwoman of the judging panel of Apprenticeship Awards Cymru, said there had been more than 180 applications for the 2024 awards.

""This year's applications are a reflection of the extraordinary potential in Wales; they are of a very high standard,"" she said.

""The winners and finalists have established a new benchmark for vocational education in Wales, and I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to everyone involved.""

Among the other winners was Needle Rock, an upholstery business established by Dr Ali J Wright in Llanrhystud near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion.

By starting the venture in 2013, Dr Wright - a former UK government plant health inspector - has turned her hobby of rescuing old furniture into a flourishing business which employs four people.

CJ McCollum scored 30 points, Jose Alvarado added 17 and the Pelicans had no trouble in a 111-88 win over Miami on Friday night in the NBA -- the first meeting between the teams since four players got ejected when the teams played in New Orleans last month, a night capped by Jimmy Butler saying the Heat would win the rematch, too.

""It backfired on them today,"" Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado said.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

""They were packing the paint and staying in the zone,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And I would have, too.""

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans posted on social media postgame.

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.",sports.inquirer.net,news,Inquirer,Associated Press,0.07450980392156858,448875624,1,https://sports.inquirer.net/files/2024/03/AP24083037138446-scaled.jpg,eng-9419358

""Honestly, I don't know where the financing for such a project would come from. I don't think many international donors would be interested in funding such an endeavour,"" Lu said and pointed out, ""We have also not heard from the Government of Pakistan a desire for any waiver of American sanctions that would certainly result from such a project.""

Speaking at an event marking Nowruz at the embassy's lawn, the Iranian ambassador said that a plan of action could be developed to solve this problem.

Moqaddam said that there was no scope for further extension in the agreement signed in 2009, as Iran already completed a 1,000 kilometres gas pipeline on its side at a cost of $1 billion. He highlighted that Pakistan has not yet implemented this agreement.

He added that Iran had completed its work years ago, however, it has been waiting for Pakistan to implement the agreement for the last one decade.

""The Iranian gas pipeline is in the wider interest of people of both countries,"" he said, adding that through this project, Pakistan would be able to provide cheap gas to its people.

""We can find a way to remove the obstacles in the way of gas pipeline project,"" he hoped.",geo.tv,news,GEO TV,,0.2549019607843137,448875559,1,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-03-23/l_536103_105327_updates.jpg,eng-9416057

The late Prime Minister Melese Zenawi laid the foundation stone in 2011, marking the start of a project that has since symbolized Ethiopia's ambition and resilience in the face of longstanding challenges to its development rights over the Abbay River.

According to Ethiopian News Agency, the construction of the GERD has been a source of national pride and unity, transcending ethnic, religious, and ideological differences. Initially projected to take five years, the dam's completion has been extended to nearly 13 years due to a variety of factors, including external pressures, notably from Egypt, over concerns about water rights and regional hydro-politics. Despite these challenges, Ethiopia has consistently advocated for a cooperative approach to the utilization of the Abbay, a transboundary river, emphasizing the mutual benefits and fair use of its waters among Nile riparian states.

In 2015, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan signed the Declaration of Principles in Khartoum to facilitate cooperation, but subsequent negotiations have been hindered by disagreements, particularly Egypt's reliance on colonial-era water rights. Nonetheless, Ethiopia has reiterated that the dam's construction adheres to international conventions and aims to provide essential electricity to over 60% of its population currently reliant on bio-fuels, without intending harm to downstream nations.

Beyond electricity generation, the GERD is seen as a catalyst for regional development, promising opportunities for fishery, ecotourism, and enhanced energy sharing among African nations. This aligns with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and other initiatives aiming at regional integration and development. The dam, which is set to be the largest hydropower project in Africa with a $5 billion investment, also opens prospects for tourism and investment in the hospitality industry, with 70 islands created in its reservoir.

Ethiopia's government and its citizens have shown unwavering dedication to overcoming obstacles to complete the dam, which now stands at 95% completion. The project not only reflects Ethiopia's journey towards self-reliance and economic development but also its potential role in fostering cooperation and development across Africa. As Ethiopia continues to connect its power grid with neighboring countries, the GERD embodies the nation's determination to achieve prosperity through collective effort and innovation.",africanewswire.za.com,news,Africa News Wire,,0.1294117647058823,448875389,1,,

The selection of the resources that need to stay under the ground compared with those that can be extracted is a crucial step on the way to imagining and constructing an effective international system to leave a share of existing global fossil fuel resources unextracted.

Certain oil resources around the world should stay underground to limit rising global temperatures, researchers say.

Specific areas of oil reserved should be excluded from extraction in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius [2.7 degrees Fahrenheit], according to a new paper in the scientific journal Nature Communications.

A map of the world showing these areas, which the researchers call the ""unburnable oil atlas,"" reveals which areas must be left alone to achieve these climate goals and avoid a positive feedback loop of climate disasters.

The Paris Climate Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, during the COP21 conference. The primary aim is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C.

This increase in global temperatures is mainly driven by the release of greenhouse gases like CO2 into the atmosphere. When solar radiation reaches the Earth's surface, some of it is absorbed, while the rest is reflected out into space.

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb some of this outgoing infrared radiation and re-radiate it in all directions, including back toward the Earth's surface, causing a slow increase in temperatures worldwide.

The total CO2 emissions that can be released before global warming mounts this 1.5 C limit is known as the remaining carbon budget. According to the paper, the remaining carbon budget as of January 2023 that had a 50 percent chance of limiting temperatures below 1.5 C was about 250 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2). For reference, about 4.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) were released by the U.S. in 2022.

""This budget is steadily decreasing at current rates of human-induced emissions -- about 42 GtCO2 per year -- and will be completely used up by 2028,"" study author Lorenzo Pellegrini, a professor of Economics of Environment and Development at the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University Rotterdam said in a statement.

The atlas of unburnable oil was created using a variety of environmental and social criteria to determine which resource regions needed to be left alone to limit global temperature rise. It also took factors including natural protected areas, priority areas for biodiversity conservation, areas of high endemic species richness, urban areas and the territories of indigenous people into account.

""Our study reveals which oil resources should be kept underground and not commercially exploited, with special attention to those deposits that overlap with areas of high endemic richness or coincide with outstanding socio-environmental values in different regions of the planet.

""The results show that the exploitation of the selected resources and reserves is totally incompatible with the achievement of the Paris Agreement commitments,"" study author Martí Orta-Martínez, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Barcelona, said in the statement.

The researchers note that even if this map were adhered to, it may not be enough to limit temperature rises to 1.5 C. In a future where temperatures exceed this level, it could push the planet over a tipping point, where permafrost melt, forest fires and sea ice loss cause even greater levels of CO2 to be released into the atmosphere.

""If these thresholds are exceeded, this could lead to an abrupt release of carbon into the atmosphere (climate feedback),"" Orta-Martínez said, as this would ""amplify the effects of climate change and trigger a cascade of effects that commit the world to large-scale, irreversible changes.""

If all the fossil fuel reserves remaining on Earth were burned, around 10,000 GtCO2 would be released into the atmosphere. This is about 40 times the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 C, the researchers say.

""In addition, the combustion of developed fossil fuel reserves -- i.e. those reserves of oil and gas fields and coal mines currently in production or under construction -- will emit 936 GtCO2, four times more than the remaining carbon budget for a global warming of 1.5°C,"" study author Gorka Muñoa said in the statement.

The authors hope that this paper and their atlas of unburnable oil highlight the importance of not extracting any more fossil fuels from the ground if we want to achieve our climate goals.

""The goal of no more than 1.5 degrees C global warming requires a complete halt to exploration for new fossil fuel deposits, a halt to the licensing of new fossil fuel extraction, and the premature closure of a very significant share (75 percent) of oil, gas and coal extraction projects currently in production or already developed,"" the authors said.

""Massive investment in clean energy sources is needed to secure global energy demand, enact and support suspensions and bans on fossil fuel exploration and extraction, and adhere to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.""",energyindemand.com,news,Energy in Demand - Sustainable Energy - Rod Janssen,Rod Janssen,0.1843137254901961,448875362,1,https://energyindemand.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/jess1.png?w=640,eng-9419708

Chairman Adnan Zainol Abidin said high gas prices precipitated by ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and West Asia were key factors in elevating internal gas consumption costs across the company's business segments, most notably in its utilities segment where energy consumption is the primary expense.

""Our regasification and transportation segments were especially exposed to currency fluctuations, due to some of our US dollar-denominated long-term contractual obligations and the higher costs of imported materials,"" he said in PGB's integrated report 2023.

Furthermore, industry players are facing increasingly stringent regulations and stakeholder expectations surrounding sustainability and climate action, with many of its major institutional shareholders closely analysing the sustainability initiatives to ensure they meet their sustainable investing parameters, he said.

""By resolutely focusing on driving cost optimisation and operational efficiency, supported by the targeted introduction of digital solutions, we successfully mitigated the year's high-cost environment, delivering a resilient financial performance that stands us in strong stead for the future,"" Adnan said in the report released on Friday.

At the same time, Adnan said, the gas processing and transportation company navigated the evolving sustainability environment adeptly towards net zero carbon emission.

This will pivot its position as a key driver of the nation's energy transition through the government's National Energy Transition Roadmap launched in August 2023, he said.

As a contributor to the roadmap's catalyst projects, PGB now has the opportunity to capture new value propositions in the renewable energy and carbon abatement spaces, greenifying its portfolio for long-term value creation, Adnan said.

""Drawing upon our infrastructure and competitive advantages in the energy sector, we are participating in some of the catalyst projects to enhance our economic sustainability while contributing to the nation's climate and energy objectives,"" he said.

Moving forward, Adnan said PGB's focus will lie in improving its performance against the ambitions of the strategic agenda and maintaining the momentum that it has created in greenifying its portfolio.

""To drive progress, we have identified specific targets and goals within the pillars of Growth, Operational Excellence, Commercial Excellence and Project Excellence, and these, collectively referred to as G5dot5, will guide us in building a stronger and more resilient PGB in the years ahead and toward the agenda's conclusion in 2030,"" he said.

Looking beyond the near term, and notwithstanding its existing renewable energy investments, the company believes that natural gas has a critical role to play in the ASEAN region's energy transition.

With high reliability, a low levelised cost of energy, and about 40 per cent lower carbon emissions compared to coal, it will be a vital transitional fuel for the coming decades as countries gradually invest in building the infrastructure required to deploy renewable energy at scale, he said.

""On this note, the liberalisation of the regional energy market presents a prime opportunity for PGB to play a better role as a natural gas infrastructure service provider across ASEAN, while Malaysia positions itself as the region's gas hub.

""We remain hopeful that Malaysia will continue to move towards a conducive ecosystem to support this aspiration,"" Adnan added.

Preliminary information suggests that the refinery was targeted by a drone attack, like nearly 15 other oil refineries and oil depots earlier this year. In recent months, several oil refineries and depots across Russia have been targeted, including facilities in Krasnodar Krai, Kaluga Oblast, Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Oryol, Kursk, Volgograd, and Saint Petersburg.

The attack comes after the FT publication suggested that the US has allegedly urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, expressing concerns about the potential impact on global oil prices and the possibility of Russian retaliation. The Financial Times reported that senior officials at Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) and Military Intelligence Directorate (HUR) were warned that the drone strikes could lead to higher oil prices and provoke retaliatory measures from Russia.

""With proper metering, Nigeria should know the volume of crude oil leaving each flow station, and the quantity that finally gets to the tank farm. It can calculate loss to oil thieves or incidents of spills.

""This is the reason behind the advocacy, but unfortunately, the authorities have continued to give conflicting daily production.

""Of concern is the revelation that there is bigger oil thievery at the export terminals, where quantities or volume of crude oil exported are undervalued. This is because of the criminal collaboration between the oil companies, security agencies at export terminals, and officials of Federal Government regulatory agencies like the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited, NNPCL. With such, to know the exact quantity or volume of crude the nation produces daily is impossible.

""About the crude oil thievery at the export terminals, a paper presented by a top naval officer during the climax of 2014 Bayelsa Security Week had it in black and white. He indicted the security agencies, oil companies, and federal government officials at export terminals.

""And, I will let you have the section of his presentation referring to this criminal collaboration at export terminals. Even from this perspective, one can conclude that it is very true that Nigeria does not have exact knowledge of her daily crude oil production...made so by corruption.""

A former security operative corroborating the claim, said, ""The nation's crude oil production reeks with corruption, especially at the export terminals where vessels laden with crude oil are often undervalued.""

He fingered highly- -placed government officials, the NNPCL, and the security agencies of complicity in the thievery.

""The problem with our country is that we are always chasing shadows instead of doing the right thing. Corruption is entrenched in the nation's oil industry, especially at the export terminals.

""In my time, sometimes, the manifest of the foreign vessels that came to load crude is in their mother tongue and you are at a loss as per the actual quantity they were billed to load. Because they have the backing of some 'ogas', there is little or nothing you can do. If you insist on doing the proper thing as a patriot, they post you out.""

The Facilitator of the Niger Delta Democratic Union, NDDU, Dr. Akpo Mudiaga -Odje, said the group, and other concerned Nigerians, had called on the Federal Government and NNPCL ""to tell Nigerians with arithmetic certainty the amount of crude oil we produce every day, every week, every month and every year, long ago.""

""To date, neither the Federal Government of Nigeria nor the NNPCL has been able to supply us with any such data.

""Indeed, without such reliable data, there becomes a holistic room for manipulation in the system.

""I recall that in 1984, the former Chief of Staff, Gen Tunde Idiagbon, usually as a commendable practice, publicly disclosed how many barrels of crude oil sold as well as income made from same to Nigerians every month.

""This is the act of transparency we urgently require from the Federal Government of Nigeria and the NNPCL to get first-hand information on this vexed issue.

""The nation is ripped off by the non-disclosure of the amount of crude oil produced daily and/or income accruing to the Federation Account from such sales.

""We, therefore, call on the NNPCL, especially, to procure the necessary equipment to enable it to ascertain the amount of crude oil we produce and export daily so that Nigerians can get a piece of first-hand information on the sale and management of their commonwealth.

""The most important priority now is for the NNPCL to immediately procure the required equipment to determine the quantity of crude oil we produce in this country every day, every week, every month, and every year.

""Once this is achieved with substantial certainty, the next is to secure the production, distribution, and exportation.

An oil industry stakeholder and former labor leader, Mr. Emmanuel Igbini, fired by a multinational oil company, Elf Petroleum Nigeria Limited, now TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria Limited in 2000 for exposing the massive fraud perpetuated by oil companies, wrote to Obasanjo about the matter, but he took no action.

""So why did he wait so long till after his tenure to confess this fact that was well known to him? He queried.

Igbini, however, stated pointedly that NNPCL could not tackle this problem, adding, ""Because there have been various media reports, over the years, of arrests, investigations, and prosecutions of some of the top management staff of the NNPC for their alleged involvement in massive theft of crude oil and or their collusion with those petro-terrorists in these multinational oil companies.""

His words: ""NNPCL, as it is composed today, is largely made up of people from the same NNPC, and worse is that they are now made almost unaccountable to Nigeria. Whatever the Board and Management choose to declare to Nigerians as the volume of crude produced and sold and net income derived from it, is what the nation accepts and works with. It is sad!""

To solve the problem, I counsel President Tinubu to retain the Minister of Petroleum Resources. He will exercise his constitutional power to declare full-scale military war against those bent on undermining the national security, economy, peace, and order of our country.

""Our country is in this state of calamity because majorly the needed foreign revenues from the petroleum sector are being looted through massive stealing of the nation's crude oil.

Executive Director, COMPPART Foundation for Justice and Peacebuilding in Akwa Ibom State, Saviour Akpan, told Saturday Vanguard: ""I do not think there is anybody qualified enough to debunk this than former President Olusegun Obasanjo, but the only problem I have is why he is telling us now? Why did you not say this during your reign in power or within the 16-year rule of the PDP as your party?

""It is unfortunate that our parents always like to give us credible information when they are close to the where we can no longer see them and ask questions. If what is alleged is the situation, what stops us as a country from probing and bringing the perpetrators to book?""

Coordinator, Niger Delta Peace Coordinator, NDPC, Zik Gbemre, said: ""Should we take Obasanjo seriously? No smoke without fire, not only is his allegation common knowledge; he is being malicious and not looking for a solution.""

""Obasanjo, as former president and minister of petroleum, should be giving us a solution, and not involved in blame games. He was there and never accounted for the nation's oil and gas, which the nation produced, and exported at that time.

""He should tell us why he failed to account for the oil in his time. He was there as minister and president and saw how serious the stealing of crude oil was. He was there as president and minister of petroleum and saw that there was no record of the sale of crude oil.

""Obasanjo saw it but refused to put measures in place to monitor oil companies, NNPC, the military, DSS, and Police on crude oil production. We know that the military and DSS collude with the syndicates to steal the nation's oil.

""Old wine in a new bottle tastes the same. NNPC and its subsidiaries and their assets, including NPDC, now renamed NNPC E & P Limited should be divested and put a reliable institution to regulate the production and sale of crude oil.

""Military officers, DSS, and Police caught colluding should be sanctioned. What is the difference between NNPC and NNPCL? What is the difference between NUPRC and DPR? What is the difference between NAPIMS and NNPC Upstream Investment Services, NUIS?

""NNPCL and its subsidiaries and assets need to be disbanded and sold to private investors that can run oil businesses. The entire NNPCL and subsidiaries are rotten. 99.9 percent of their personnel live on bribes. So how do they account for the oil and gas?

The Chairman of Community Development Committees (CDCs), Board of Trustees of Oil and Mineral Producing Communities of the Niger Delta region, Chief Joseph Ambakaderimo, wondered at what point Obasanjo became aware that the total sum of oil Nigeria produces could not be accounted for. ""Oil theft did not start today; it has gotten to this crescendo because nothing tangible has been done to stem this very embarrassing menace. ""Who monitors what happens in the high seas and the crude oil loading terminals? These are the places where the bulk of the theft occurs"".

He said the committees have since identified the lack of coordinated strategy, and a plan of action as the reason oil theft was not abating.

""Going forward, the technologies to monitor our pipelines are there on the shelves crying to be acquired and deployed, but we have not shown the political will to do it because many of the people across the board today have been benefiting from the lapses, and complacency has set in.""",vanguardngr.com,news,Vanguard,,-0.4588235294117647,448874047,1,https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Crude-oil-theft.jpg,eng-9416814

Here's What to Know.,"Legislators and activists are rallying to squeeze the NY HEAT Act into the state budget by the April 1 deadline.

A bill gaining traction in Albany aims to break New Yorkers' reliance on natural gas in hopes that they will seek out greener alternatives.

Efforts to shoehorn the NY HEAT Act into a packed state budget are underway, with supporters contending that swift action is necessary because of the pressures of climate change and opponents say the proposed law should be set aside and more carefully considered. The deadline to finalize the budget is April 1.

But what does the bill propose, exactly? Here's what to know.

What would it do?

The NY HEAT (New York Home Energy Affordable Transition) Act seeks to limit a requirement known as the ""obligation to serve,"" where utilities automatically provide gas to new customers who request it, and to curb the expansion of gas infrastructure.

Gas companies must provide free hookups to new customers within 100 feet of the pipe system. Existing ratepayers subsidize the work.

Getting rid of the so-called 100-foot rule would save ratepayers about $200 million annually and encourage utilities and new customers to explore other energy options.

What's the goal?

The bill's broader aim is to accelerate a shift away from natural gas and help limit emissions from the burning of fossil fuels that cause global warming.",nytimes.com,news,The New York Times,Hilary Howard,0.192156862745098,448873316,1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/03/21/nyregion/00nyheat-explainer/00nyheat-explainer-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

Stock up on fuel and food

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Arations in the air and at sea

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.

Leading Colorado environmental groups filed language Thursday for three sweeping ballot measures aimed at limiting the oil and gas industry in the state, openly declaring them a blocking effort to as many as a half-dozen equally sweeping proposals supported by oil interests.

The potential ballot battle, alongside a number of anti-oil and gas bills still under debate in the legislature this year, is a renewal of the election year games of chicken from 2018, 2020 and 2022. In some past elections, environmental groups and oil and gas representatives agreed to take competing measures off the table so long as it was a bilateral disarmament.

Gov. Jared Polis, who has said in the past he wants to give existing oil and gas pollution limits time to work, encouraged the sides to stand down. He even declared an end to the state's so-called oil and gas wars in 2019 when he signed a regulatory overhaul into law.

They're fighting oil drilling","LOS ANGELES -- As the oil industry wages a multimillion-dollar campaign to repeal California drilling restrictions, the campaign to defend the state's environmental protections is starting to resemble a Hollywood blockbuster.

In a showcase of political clout and celebrity influence, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and actor Jane Fonda joined Gov. Gavin Newsom and environmental advocates Friday in Los Angeles to call on voters to rescue Senate Bill 1137, a state law that intends to ban new oil and gas drilling within 3,200 feet of homes, schools and parks next year.

Although Newsom signed the measure into law in 2022, California's oil industry spent around $20 million to collect enough signatures to put the law on the November ballot.

However, the fossil fuel interest groups have been challenged by a well-funded political committee whose biggest sponsors include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia and a coalition of environmental groups.

As a part of their counteroffensive, they enlisted Schwarzenegger and Fonda, two longtime opponents of oil drilling, for a news conference at a Ladera Heights soccer field that neighbors the Inglewood Oil Field -- the nation's largest urban drill site.

""They're spending millions and millions of dollars because they want to tell the California people that it is safe to drill next to a house,"" Schwarzenegger said as pumpjacks slowly bobbed behind him.

""They're coming back with the same trick and the same dialog. There will be no difference. They will be terminated again,"" he continued, referencing his famed ""Terminator"" movie franchise.

The oil industry has argued that less domestic oil production will result in more imported petroleum and higher emissions from shipping.

""Senate Bill 1137 doesn't just prevent new wells. It shuts down existing wells since maintenance is not allowed,"" said Rock Zierman, CEO of the California Independent Petroleum Assn. ""That means we will import more from the Saudi royal family instead of using local energy produced by California workers.""

The oil drilling referendum has evolved into one of the most expensive ballot measures of the 2024 general election so far, according to state election data. And the consequences, environmental advocates say, are far-reaching.

There are more than 100,000 unplugged oil and gas wells across California, which are known to release cancer-causing chemicals and planet-warming methane.

Around 30,000 of these wells are within 3,200 feet of sensitive sites, according to the California Department of Conservation, the state agency that supervises drilling. That includes the homes of about 2.7 million Californians.

""Oil companies call the frontline communities 'sacrifice zones,' "" said Fonda, who has launched her own political action committee to oust fossil fuel supporters from public office. ""We have to prove to them that we will not tolerate so many Californians to be considered sacrificeable.""

Environmental activist Nalleli Cobo, who grew up within 30 feet of oil wells in South Los Angeles, said she has experienced the health effects firsthand. Since she was 9, she has suffered nosebleeds so severe she has to sleep in a chair to avoid choking at night.

""Clean air is a basic and fundamental human right that has been denied to us,"" Cobo said at Friday's event. ""The oil industry has no place in our backyards, in our democracy, or in our future. Let us prove to the oil industry that they do not have that power.""

Newsom emphasized the importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels to meet the state's lofty climate goals and stave off the worst effects of warming.

""Let's not mince words: The climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis. Period,"" Newsom said.

He added: ""It's the burning of gas, it's the burning of coal, it's the burning of oil. And these guys, they played us for fools.""

Newsom's remarks are his latest provocation against the state's oil producers. He has previously said he supports ending oil extraction by 2045, the year state officials hope the state will have eliminated its carbon footprint.

Newsom and California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced last year the state was suing some of the largest oil companies for deceiving the public about global warming.

In joining Schwarzenegger, California's last Republican governor, Newsom said the fight to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases is bipartisan, noting President Nixon's formation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and former California Gov. Ronald Reagan's creation of the California Air Resources Board.

Newsom said some Californians have already witnessed the devastating effects of global warming, underscoring the need for action.

""There's no Democratic, no Republican thermometer,"" Newsom said. ""There's just reality.""

""You have to believe your own eyes,"" he added. ""This planet is heating up. It's choking up, it's burning up. We have simultaneous droughts and rain bombs happening over and over and over again. Lifestyles, places, traditions being completely eliminated.""

CJ McCollum scored 30 points, Jose Alvarado added 17 and the Pelicans had no trouble in a 111-88 win over Miami on Friday night -- the first meeting between the teams since four players got ejected when the teams played in New Orleans last month, a night capped by Jimmy Butler saying the Heat would win the rematch, too.

""It backfired on them today,"" Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado said.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

""They were packing the paint and staying in the zone,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And I would have, too.""

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans posted on social media postgame.

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the gasoline product supplied, a key demand indicator, fell to just below 9 million barrels per day. This figure represents a notable 4.5% drop from the previous week, highlighting a potential shift in energy consumption patterns in the U.S. The decrease is significant, given the historical link between gasoline demand and oil prices. The drop could suggest an overvaluation of demand strength, potentially signaling a reevaluation in market expectations and a reassessment of future price directions.

Geopolitical events have been central in influencing oil supply and market sentiment. The United States' push for a U.N. resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza is particularly noteworthy. While mainly a diplomatic effort, such developments can significantly impact the oil market due to the region's strategic importance in global oil supply. Historically, Middle Eastern geopolitical instability has often led to increased oil market volatility, with price surges reflecting concerns over supply disruptions.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy continues to be a crucial factor in shaping market perceptions. The decision to maintain interest rates steady, with projections for three rate cuts within the year, could have a dual impact. On one side, lower interest rates might stimulate economic growth, potentially leading to increased oil demand. However, the real impact of these rate cuts will largely depend on the overall health of the global economy, which is currently showing mixed signals, with certain key economies displaying signs of slowing growth.

The strength of the U.S. Dollar significantly influences crude oil prices. A stronger dollar, as seen following key global financial events like the Swiss National Bank's interest rate cut, makes oil more expensive for non-dollar holders, thus potentially reducing international demand. This week's strengthening of the dollar adds another layer of complexity to the market. The dollar's strength inversely correlates with commodity prices, and as such, is crucial in determining oil demand and pricing on the global stage.

Looking ahead, the immediate outlook for WTI crude appears cautious. On one side, the reduction in U.S. gasoline demand suggests potential downward pressure on oil prices. On the other, geopolitical developments and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy might introduce counteracting factors. The market is at a critical juncture, with these elements likely to influence the direction of oil prices in the coming week. Market participants should closely monitor domestic consumption patterns and international geopolitical developments for insights into potential price movements, especially considering the heightened market sensitivity to these factors. The role of the U.S. Dollar in shaping international demand will also be key in the short-term direction of oil prices.",fxempire.com,news,FXEmpire.com,James Hyerczyk,0.1137254901960785,448871674,26,https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/03/Oil-Barrel-3-1.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700,

PAUL OKAH speaks with a cross- section of citizens on how they are coping with the distress.

Bathing multiple times helpful

The heat is really high these days. It's just like someone opened the doors of hell and forgot to close it. I mean, how do you explain the fact that even the wind is hot whenever it chooses to blow? To compound matters, there is no steady power supply for either table or ceiling fans or for those who have air conditioners to make use of them. The situation is that bad. I have heat rashes all over my body because of the heat.

Electricity supply is almost at zero level in my area.

If the light comes in at night, it may be for just thirty minutes or one hour and then you face the heat again.

And I can't afford fuel for my generator nowadays. With the high cost of fuel since fuel subsidy removal, I only make use of my generator in extreme cases. If I decide to use my generator everyday because of the heat, then I will be spending over N5, 000 on a daily basis on fuel alone. Therefore, my appeal to AEDC is to look into the reason power supply is no longer as steady as it was before. I have to bathe like four or five times a day because of the heat.

Another implication is that I spend more on the soap I use, so it's discouraging. If I decide not to bathe many times, the heat will be intense. Hopefully, the rainy season can start in earnest so that we don't get roasted by heat because the situation is no longer something to laugh about.

How I cope with the excess heat is by taking my bath many times and sleeping naked. Luckily, my house is tiled so I sleep on the floor. If you don't bathe multiple times, the heat will really deal with you. So, the trick is to bathe as many times as possible. How can people even stay up to 12 hours without taking their bath? Some people don't bathe for a whole day, so the heat period is making people maintain personal hygiene.

You're on your own if you don't bathe multiple times because the heat will just be making you sweat excessively and to be uncomfortable. You will even get heat rashes as the sweat will soak your clothes. In fact, I take a break from my work as a hairdresser to bathe because my shop is close to my house. There is no steady light, so the heat in my shop is too much for me to stay and be sweating. Due to the high cost of fuel, we hardly use our generator except if the customer is willing to pay double for our services, which is rare. So, I try my best to keep the heat under control by bathing and using a hand fan to fan myself when I am not busy attending to customers. Also, whenever I come back from the shop, I bathe multiple times before going to bed. I stay alone so I sleep stark naked on the floor and that way, I save myself from the heat.

The heat is more intense during the day, so I bought this rubber half shoe. I take my bathe with the rubber shoe and allow some little quantity of water inside it to be in contact with my leg. I then stay where I receive fresh air and then feel the coolest nature of my day. Then at night, I make sure I rub powder after taking my bath. The powder helps to absorb heat. Many people may not know this trick, but once you rub powder after bathing, you won't feel heat again. It's a trick many people should be applying at this time. I learnt it from my mother. Ever since I became an adult, it has been helping me.

So, I'll recommend the application of powder on the body for anyone facing heat, especially if the person doesn't have light in his area to use AC or fan. Again, if you are living in an area that has trees as shades, try and make use of the trees because they will really be helpful at this point. Home is good when built well. Home should have trees and flowers planted in it. You wouldn't complain if you have a good home like our forefathers. I have a tiny home with a nice garden on it. When you come around, you will understand what I mean. God created us and trees, plants to keep us comfortable. So, I sit under the tree in the daytime when the weather is too hot. Then in the night, I bathe, rub powder and sleep with light clothes.

There is a saying that desperate situations call for desperate measures. The solution to the heat wave is fresh air. I open all my windows while at home because the power supply has been very bad in my area these days. So, I open all my windows till day break and with constant bathing. After bathing, I don't even dry my body with a towel. I allow my body to dry by itself. Then apply powder to feel cool. For now, this heat has no other remedy, except if you have a 24-hour power supply with the correct AC or fan, which is being frustrated by NEPA.

Even a fan is not totally helpful in the afternoon because it's blowing heat and hot air. But that is by the way. So, after everything, I bathe and sleep naked in the night and with my windows open. There is no special trick, but once you notice heat at midnight, you can just go have a shower and go back to sleep. I often bathe around 10:00pm or 2:00am before I wake up around five. I have been begging God to have mercy on me with this heat. It's not funny anymore. It should be raining by now, so I don't know why we are feeling this much heat.

It is not to complain about the heat that I focus on, but the solution because the thing is getting out of hand. It is as if DisCos have chosen to use the opportunity to compound our problems by not giving us light like before. So, I cope by bathing like four times a day. I wear light clothes to sleep and I sleep on the floor, not on the bed.

So, for those complaining of heat, bath regularly, wear very light clothing, ventilate your space, apply powder, have a series of hand fans (rechargeable, plastic, Hausa type) and drink plenty of water. This works for me. If you're at home, after taking your bath don't clean your body. Don't wear clothes if you're living alone, put on only shorts.

At work, don't apply much cream. Put on a light clothe, avoid black clothes for now as they're known to attract heat. It's the sun that's causing you much heat, so drink water often. I have even returned to the root of our first father, which is Adam. I no longer wear clothes. Sleeping on my sit-out has become my hobby.",blueprint.ng,news,Blueprint Newspapers Limited,,-0.1372549019607843,448871211,1,https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/power-electricity-1.jpg,eng-9413677

This is even as the cost of charcoal has also risen owing to high demands, with some people switching to firewood; BENJAMIN SAMSON reports.

Findings by Blueprint Weekend in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and some parts of Nasarawa state showed that the average price of refilling cooking gas per KG is ₦1,300. This is against N700 to N800 in December 2023.

Lamentations

Some of the residents in separate interviews with this reporter lamented the hike in the price of cooking gas, which has forced them to resort to buying firewood and charcoal for cooking.

They urged the federal government to help them to reduce the cost of the product. According to them, it's become unbearable for them.

A mother of four who simply identified herself as Sherifat told this reporter that she has made use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also called cooking gas, for almost eight years. But she said had no choice but to stop, stressing that ""it became unaffordable.""

Before making what she described as the ""right decision"" to completely abandon cooking gas, she first started using it sparingly.

""I would use the gas cylinder only in the morning during weekdays to cook for my children who have to leave for school by 7:30 am.

""Even though the cost of filling the gas had already increased a bit, I was managing to fill it because it is harder and more stressful to use charcoal to cook very early in the morning,"" she said.

In spite of the extra stress, the middle-aged trader eventually resorted to using charcoal for all her cooking activities due to its affordability and the rising prices of cooking gas.

Mr. Nandam Goyat, a civil servant who resides in Mararaba in Karu local government area of neighbouring Nasarawa state, said, ""When I can no longer bear the cost of N1, 300 per Kg of gas, I told my wife to return to charcoal, although it's not convenient, there is nothing we can do since there is nobody to explain the high cost.""

Another resident, Mrs. Mercy Joseph, said she has now resorted to the use of firewood to cook her food rather than buying cooking gas since she can no longer afford it.

""Yes, firewood litters the environment and the smoke is unhygienic but we have no choice? Foodstuffs are very costly too, so we have to manage what we can afford to ensure the family eats,"" she said.

Also, Mrs. Elizerbeth Alagbe, lamented that she had abandoned the kitchen for the open space just to use firewood which she said was not convenient anyway.

According to her, ""Our pots now get so black and dirty unlike the cooking gas which keeps everywhere neat when cooking.""

Mr. Samuel Akinrinwa said he had to get a coal pot for his wife and buy charcoal for cooking instead of buying the costly cooking gas despite the unhygienic state of firewood and kerosene stove.

""We are groaning over a 14-year blackout in this area, foodstuffs are costly as well as cooking gas, I think the government needs to do something as life is unbearable for residents here,"" he said.

A housewife, Mrs. Muinat Akeen, said she had gone back to the use of her kerosene stove since the gas prices began to rise, adding that the situation ""is getting worse by the day.""

Firewood, charcoal sellers

Meanwhile, Mrs. Asabe Luka, a firewood seller, told Blueprint Weekend that many customers now patronise her since the price of cooking gas has risen.

She said, ""We sell firewood from N200, and N300 to N500 and above, I used to sell for food and fish sellers before, but several housewives have joined my customers now.""

Mrs. Janet Mesioye, a charcoal seller, said that there was not much difference from what she used to sell before, observing that charcoal prices too were going higher.

""Charcoal price is getting higher now as the quantity we used to buy at N100, 000 now sells for N135, 000 and there is little difference from what I used to sell now compared to before,"" she said.

An expert's view point

In a chat with this reporter, an oil and gas expert, Dr. Dauda Garuba, said the consequence of people using an alternative means of cooking would not be palatable.

He said, ""To ask what we can do about the high cost of cooking gas is to play innocent. What will happen is anybody's guess. It is obviously not going to be palatable to the environment. We are going to be victims of deforestation and greenhouse gas emission. Temperature in the country is already hot with people talking of 41 degree Celsius in the North and 38 degree Celsius in the South.

""Never in the history of Nigeria have we been faced with this manner of economic hardship. The country is facing a huge energy crisis - from fossil fuel to electricity to cooking gas. The signs are ominous. Yet, energy is central to national questions and security. What is more fundamental is that power wielders are living a profligate life while asking the rest of the people to sacrifice for their luxury.

""Aside from the recognition of LPG by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a clean cooking solution to reducing exposure to household air pollution, especially in low-income households, further research has shown that it is poised to deliver substantial health, economic, and social benefits.

""Due to its low carbon-to-hydrogen ratio, LPG - a mixture of two hydrocarbons, butane and propane - contributes little to global warming. In 2019, Nigeria's ministry of petroleum resources said the LPG Penetration Programme is a component of the country's intended nationally designed contributions under the Paris Agreement for reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

""However, due to the incessant rise in its cost, which creates an affordability gap, Nigerians have no choice but to embrace cheaper alternatives for cooking, primarily through kerosene, firewood and charcoal.

""The problem with these alternatives is that they increase the emission rate of greenhouse gasses and drive deforestation among other environmental disasters such as desertification, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and loss of wildlife.

""For example, firewood, which serves as the primary cooking fuel for 72 percent of Nigerians, is derived by cutting trees illegally. Before now, 50 per cent of the country's landmass was covered by trees but today, 90 per cent of these trees have been removed. About 36 percent of these trees were removed in the last 20 years.""

Similarly, an environmental activist, Tunde Awosika, in a chat with this reporter, said the effects of deforestation on the environment range from soil erosion and loss of biodiversity ecosystems to loss of wildlife and increased desertification.

""The risks from deforestation are huge. Forest loss and damage is the cause of around 10% of global warming. There's simply no way we can fight the climate crisis if we don't stop deforestation,"" he said.

He noted that the illegal use of firewood for cooking has negative health and environmental implications.

""If there is any need to cut one tree, you must arrest the situation by planting two or more trees as a replacement,"" Tokunbo said.

NCCC's take

Likewise, in a chat with this reporter, the convener of the coalition, the National Coalition on Climate Change (NCCC), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Mustapha Agwai, has said aside from the dangers of deforestation and climate destruction, use of firewood and charcoal for cooking has direct effects on the health of women.

Agwai, however, said the coalition through the federal government was partnering with a German non-profit organisation, Atmosfair, in the production of Stove80 which will reduce cost of cooking energy, improve women's health and protect the environment.

He said, ""One of the heaviest activities of man that is responsible for releasing the gases responsible for global warming and climate change is dependence on firewood for cooking.

""In an attempt to reduce this dependence on fire wood, we partnered with Atmosfair to bring this stove that is called Stove80 so that more women would access it.""

The way out

To stop the incessant hikes in the price, Bala Zakka, an oil and gas analyst, said the nation's leaders must accept that internal refining and domestication of refineries is the only sustainable way forward.

Zakka said, ""The refusal to accept this is the principal reason why Nigeria is experiencing all these.

""When you refine, the first product you get is LPG, known as cooking gas. If we refine internally, the first thing that would happen is that there would be self-sufficiency in terms of cooking gas. Because we are not refining internally, citizens are now using firewood.""

Speaking on the internal pricing model which affects local prices, Zakka maintained that the NLNG is a consortium that does not belong to Nigeria.

""It is only what belongs to Nigeria that we can have the flexibility to determine what happens. The LNG's target is the international market right from day one.""

He noted that without refining locally, the only other option is to continue to import LPG to meet the local supply gap. ""But the only real solution is to refine internally. We already know our problem. It would also save us from foreign exchange pressure,"" the public affairs analyst said further.

FG's reaction

Meanwhile, the Special Adviser to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Energy, Mrs. Olu Arowolo Verheijen, has attributed the high cost of cooking gas foreign exchange and the market forces of demand and supply.

She stated this while fielding questions from journalists during the 4th edition of the ministerial briefing organised by the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation in Abuja.

She, however, said the federal government is working hard to put measures in place to bring down the price of cooking gas.

""On the price of cooking gas, the president introduced some initiatives around last Christmas around November, and we saw a decline in prices. Significant of our (liquefied petroleum gas (LPGs) are imported, we are price takers not price setters.

""However, because the president was concerned about the cost of living, he approved a fast-tracking of fiscal incentives to enable more investments into the LPG space with the hope that if we achieve scale we can bring down cost, and we saw a deep in prices, unfortunately foreign exchange and the market forces moved against us and those prices increased.

""We are going to continue to work and look at more opportunities to improve supply and scale up and enable more LPG into the market at affordable prices. This is a top priority of this administration,"" she said.",blueprint.ng,news,Blueprint Newspapers Limited,,-0.1686274509803921,448871198,1,https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/images-1-1.jpg,

The report comes amid a series of Ukrainian drone strikes on oil refineries throughout Russia.

Local residents reported explosions at the refinery and said the facility was on fire, according to Russian Telegram news channels.

The fire at the refinery was likely caused by a drone attack, the outlets claimed.

Both the associations of oil companies -- Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) and Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan (OMAP) -- have written separate letters to the government conveying that a unilateral change in the oil pricing mechanism by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) was playing a havoc with the financials of their member companies and needed correction at the outset.

Both associations, which generally do not support each other because of conflicting interests, said the exchange rate methodology used for quarterly oil pricing was incorrect and unfair to the industry and suited only to state-run Pakistan State Oil (PSO) at the cost of their commercial and financial survival.

The OCAC, which represents more than three dozen large OMCs and all the refineries, demanded ""to revert to the previous methodology (for exchange rate computation in oil pricing)"" which was a simpler and clearer process. It said the exchange rate on the day of pricing was previously used for retail computation but was unilaterally changed by Ogra to an average of 15 days, despite opposition from the oil industry because of exchange rate exposure. It demanded reverting to the old mechanism as it would give a clear picture for the next fortnight, OCAC Secretary Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi said.

Claims Rs130bn stuck due to unfair exchange rate methodology

The OMAP, another representative association of about two dozen smaller OMCs, also advocated a similar pricing mechanism, demanded a substantial increase in sale margins and raised a series of challenges, leading its members to the brink of collapse because of foreign exchange losses, OMC's margins, sales tax dues, smuggling of Iranian diesel, and the faulty pricing mechanism.

OMAP Chairman Tariq Wazir Ali offered the government to investigate the issues raised by the industry through an independent organisation and take corrective decisions on merit to spark a sense of optimism in the entire industry, particularly OMCs.

He said the existing pricing covering local refining and imports of petrol and diesel had major flaws as it lacked visibility of benchmark tenure of letters of credit (LCs), unclear exchange rates were being used and caused heavy losses to the industry due to staggered recovery adjustments and no recoveries at all in case PSO did not have cargo for a specific fortnight.

It proposed the implementation of a pool system to compensate OMCs for their verifiable foreign exchange (FX) losses and demanded a comprehensive audit to carefully assess the distribution of these losses from 2020 onward. Any excess amounts disbursed should be promptly recovered and reallocated to the entities that genuinely merit reimbursement, thereby ensuring a just and transparent process.

The price mechanism of FX adjustments needed to be revised because of significant fluctuations. It said the actual FX gain or loss of each OMC should be adjusted in prices based on 60 days LCs instead of as a specific FX adjustment by PSO. Currently, a staggering amount of Rs70 billion is stuck in FX losses adjustment, the OMAP claimed.

It sought government support in facilitating their access to financial institutions by asking Ora to issue formal letters to OMCs detailing the pending amounts. This step would enable these amounts to be accurately represented in the balance sheets of OMCs, contributing to a more precise assessment of their financial health because OMCs credit limits had long been exhausted.

The OMAP claimed that the cost of OMCs had risen to approximately Rs14 per litre sold. Keeping in view a 15pc margin for the shareholders, OMAP proposed that OMC margin should be around Rs16 per litre instead of less than Rs9 per litre.

This revision will ensure the feasibility and survival of the OMCs. The increase in OMC margins will enable the companies to operate efficiently and provide quality services to their customers, as well.",dawn.com,news,Dawn,Khaleeq Kiani,-0.2235294117647059,448870553,1,https://i.dawn.com/large/2024/03/231109438a58302.jpg?r=110947,

The photographs, taken on a trip to Norway in September 2019, depict the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard -- the fastest-warming place on earth, which is also the site of more than 100 years of coal mining. In late 2023, the Norwegian government mandated the closure of the last coal mine in Svalbard within two years.

Running since 1983, the National Photography Prize is a biennial, acquisitive prize. At the opening event on Saturday, Sydney-based Russian artist Olga Svyatova also won the $5,000 fellowship for an emerging photographer, for their work They/Они, which features family photographs from the 60s paired with photos taken in the present-day.

Dahl wanted to capture the Norwegian landscape at its most ""beautiful and melancholic"", she says.

""I knew that I was pushing my luck going up in mid-late September because it's right at the cusp of winter.

Nici Cumpston, judge of the National Photography Prize, and curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the Art Gallery of South Australia, says she awarded the prize to Dahl because of the beauty and intimacy of her photographs, and the thoughtfulness and innovation in the way they are displayed.

One large image from Dahl's series, Collapse, is a close-up of a collapsed terrain caused by melting permafrost. It's printed on fabric and hangs from the gallery ceiling, moving slightly.

Three photographs in the series were taken in the abandoned Soviet mining town of Pyramiden. For Two Sides of the Same Place, a black mountain, once the site of coal mining, is presented on one side of a piece of fabric and a nearby shrinking glacier on the other. The work is mounted at 90 degrees from the wall.

The other photograph taken in Pyramiden is Arctic Coal Diptych, two framed images of a piece of arctic coal -- one the original image and the other inverted digitally, turning the coal a shade of glacial blue.

The last photograph, titled Here/Now, depicts a mountain shrouded in fog and is displayed in a light box designed to mimic the soft light of the Arctic.

""It's such a contradicting concept to have coal mining in the most vulnerable area of the world when it comes to climate change. Climate change is happening incredibly fast up there,"" says Dahl.

Dahl is descended from the Sámi, the Indigenous peoples of the northernmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. She grew up in Hammerfest, in the north of mainland Norway, and studied photography in California before she moved to Australia at the age of 29, where she later received her masters of Fine Arts at the University of Sydney.

Now working across photography, video, sound and installation, Dahl made her start in advertising and editorial photography, and in 2006 her portrait of model Megan Gale was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery. She is currently working on her PhD at University of Tasmania.

Dahl doesn't see herself as a landscape photographer. Instead she's interested in her photography being a reflection of place, belonging and identity. Her work is not an act of documentary either, but instead is trying to inspire connection between the viewer and Svalbard as a place -- at a time when people may feel numb to hearing the facts about climate change.

""I hope people see it maybe from a slightly different perspective and different light and feel something,"" she says.

Cumpston says it's important to listen to First Nations artists like Dahl who are highlighting the threat of climate change.

""It's important for all of us globally to know what's happening on that international scale, because of course these same effects are happening within our country,"" she says.

""But to be able to relate it internationally helps raise a deeper awareness. And it's really important for the education of the next generation of people coming through, so they actively do something about it.""",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,0.3725490196078431,448870343,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7a9d8c5a4acca133fc0029b2f20d607b?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2790&cropW=4960&xPos=0&yPos=376&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,

Her two-bedroom apartment in an Soviet-era concrete building has no electricity or water supply, and the central heating is off after Russian drones and missiles struck Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, on Friday.

""It's unbearable, impossible. I want to howl with despair,"" the 33-year-old, whose husband, Mykhailo, is fighting against Russian forces in southeastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera over the phone.

The outdoor temperatures in Kharkiv barely rose above freezing on Friday, a cold drizzle was falling, and her apartment building ""is losing warmth"", she said.

Early in the morning, she jumped out of bed on hearing the thud of a powerful explosion. More than a dozen heavy, blood-curdling blasts followed as she hid in the frigid basement with her two children, Bohdan, who is seven, and four-year-old Roxana.

The children were ""hysterical"" because they had to leave their Siamese cat behind. Their pet, named Monya, wouldn't come out from under the sofa.

What roiled her and millions of Ukrainians was the scope of the bombardment, which became the largest strike on their nation's energy infrastructure since the war began in 2022.

""The aim is not just to destroy but to try yet again, like last year, to cause a massive disruption of the energy infrastructure,"" Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook.

In the winter of 2022-2023, Moscow switched to massive shelling that targeted energy infrastructure and civilian sites after realising that its blitzkrieg to take over all of Ukraine had failed.

Friday's attacks with about 60 drones and 90 missiles killed at least two people, wounded scores, struck Ukraine's largest dam and severed the power supply to the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, officials said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rebuked the West for months-long delays in military aid.

""Russian missiles have no delays, unlike aid packages for Ukraine. [Iranian-made] 'Shahed' drones have no indecision, unlike some politicians. It is critical to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Energoatom, Ukraine's main nuclear agency, said the Zaporizhzhia plant was ""on the verge of blackout"" because the strike knocked offline the main power line.

Russia seized the plant in March 2022, but failed to redirect its electricity flow to energy-starved Crimea.

The plant's reactors have been shut down but need a constant power supply to keep them cool and prevent the melting of uranium fuel rods.

Within hours, the severed line was reconnected, a source at Energoatom told Al Jazeera.

""This is the main power line. There's also a reserve one, and if only the latter is left, there's a risk of blackout,"" the source said.

Friday's attack was the second in two days - a change of tactics as Moscow ""is looking for maximally effective ways to reach its goals,"" defence spokeswoman Natalya Humenyuk said.

""We're looking for effective means to counter them - and they're looking for the ways to pressure [and] terrorise,"" she said in televised remarks.

""One can hardly remember two attacks for two days in a row. But such an attack was expected after the [presidential] election in Russia"", which was held on March 15-17, she said.

There is no change of tactics, and the Russian attacks are ""business as usual,"" Nikolay Mitrokhin at Bremen University in Germany told Al Jazeera.

They are revenge for a string of successful Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, he said.

In recent weeks, pro-Ukrainian battalions of Russian nationalists repeatedly attacked the western Russian regions of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border.

They were backed by devastating Ukrainian drone and missile strikes on Belgorod.

On Wednesday, new, advanced Ukrainian drones reached a key airfield in Russia's Volga region that has been used by strategic bombers to launch missiles on Ukraine.

Moscow said its forces shot down the drones, but Mitrokhin said the attack was ""apparently successful"".

More drone and missile attacks destroyed or damaged Russia's energy infrastructure in recent months.

Since January, Ukraine struck at least nine oil refineries in western Russia - along with depots, terminals and storage facilities - reducing Moscow's oil-processing capacity by 7 percent, according to a calculation by the Reuters news agency.

On March 13, one of the attacks set afire a refinery in the western city of Ryazan, prompting the shutdown of two refining units. The mammoth refinery produces almost 6 percent of Russia's refined crude.

A day earlier, another Ukrainian strike halved the capacity of another refinery near the city of Nizhny Novgorod that sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) east of the Ukrainian border.

The attacks dealt a blow to Moscow's main source of export revenues that fund the war in Ukraine despite crippling sanctions imposed by the West.

Washington urged Kyiv to stop the attacks on the refineries because they may escalate the conflict, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

This week's double attacks by Moscow's troops may also pave the way for Russia's summer ground offensive.

""This could be seen as a new operation that is going to become a prelude to Russia's summer offensive,"" Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.

Another observer warned that the most serious and worrying strike on Friday was the one that targeted the dam of the twin Dniprovska hydropower stations, Ukraine's largest.

""Sooner or later, strikes such as these had to take place,"" Kyiv-based analyst Ihar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera.

He said melting snow and ice in the upper reaches of the Dnipro River have already triggered a spring flood that will reach its maximum level within a month.

""Now, imagine if just one dam is hit,"" he said.

Russian missiles struck the power station in December 2022 and February 2023. Friday's attack damaged both power stations and started a large fire.

A fire broke out at the Kiubyshev oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast overnight on March 23, Russian media outlets claimed.

The report comes amid a series of Ukrainian drone strikes on oil refineries throughout Russia.

Local residents reported explosions at the refinery and said the facility was on fire, according to Russian Telegram news channels.

The fire at the refinery was likely caused by a drone attack, the outlets claimed. Russian officials have not commented on the report.

Ukrainian forces previously struck the Kiubyshev oil refinery on March 16 in a drone strike that also targeted the region's Syzran refinery. Only the Syzran facility caught fire following the attack, Russian officials claimed.

Both refineries are owned by Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company.

Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on March 22 that Russia's oil refineries are ""absolutely legitimate targets"" for the Ukrainian military. Her statement followed media reports that the U.S. had asked Ukraine to stop attacking the Russian oil industry.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

The heat and drought have not only made working conditions difficult but also impacted daily operations and sales.

Mohd Shafie Abdul Kadir, a beverage stall operator at the Lintasan Deasoka Ramadan Bazaar, voiced his concerns over the escalating heat.

""This year is exceptionally tough. The heat is unbearable compared to previous years, making us tired quickly. We can only work for short periods before needing frequent breaks,"" said Mohd Shafie Abdul Kadir, a drinks stall operator at the Lintasan Deasoka Ramadan Bazaar.

He expressed worry about the potential decline in attendance if the hot weather and drought persist.

Fatimah Rahman, a cake seller, echoed similar sentiment. The sweltering heat has made it difficult for traders to arrive early and prepare their stalls.

Additionally, the water supply issue in her home in Tanjung Aru imposed further constraints on her business, forcing her to buy water for her operations.

Nurul Albiaya Abdullah, a coconut water vendor at the Kimanis Ramadan Bazaar in Papar, also struggles with water scarcity.

""Previously, getting water was easy. But now, hardly sufficient or no water supply, we have to buy bottled water from shops, or rely on government offices or the Sabah State Water Department's (JANS),"" she said.

Mohd Hanif Anuar Yun, who sells baked chicken wings, revealed that he spends around RM150 daily on five to 10 cartons of bottled water for food preparation due to the absence of a reliable water supply.

In Tuaran, Shahjirie Rahman, who runs a soup and meatball stall at the Telipok Ramadan Bazaar, acknowledged that while traders can earn hundreds of ringgit daily, this year's profits have taken a hit due to the increased expenses on water purchases and the need for portable fans to combat the heat.

The current weather conditions in Sabah have underscored the resilience of the Ramadan bazaar traders, who continue to persevere in the face of adversity.

However, it also highlights the urgent need for measures to mitigate the impacts of such extreme weather events on small businesses.

The festive spirit leaves behind traces of exhaustion and dryness, urging us to seek solace and restoration. In the quest for post-Holi recovery, Lotus Bliss: Tranquil Body & SPA emerges as a holistic solution, offering not just physical but also emotional renewal. Let's explore how this simple yet potent elixir can guide us towards complete revitalisation.

Rejuvenation: The aftermath of Holi often leaves our skin parched and depleted. Harsh chemicals present in colors, combined with prolonged exposure to the sun, can strip away moisture and leave the skin feeling dull and lifeless. Lotus Bliss: Tranquil Body & SPA oil steps in as a gentle rescuer, infusing the skin with nourishment and hydration. Its rich blend of natural oils, such as coconut, almond, and jojoba, replenishes lost moisture, restoring the skin's vitality and radiance. With regular application, the skin regains its softness and suppleness, bidding farewell to dryness and discomfort.

Rebalance: Beyond the physical toll, Holi can also disrupt our internal equilibrium. The frenetic energy of the festivities, coupled with late nights and indulgent feasting, can throw our bodies out of balance. Lotus Bliss: Tranquil Body & SPA Oil serves as a catalyst for realignment, offering a moment of respite amidst the chaos. Its calming aroma, infused with therapeutic Blue Lotus essential oils, soothes the senses and encourages relaxation. As we massage the oil into our skin, we are reminded to breathe deeply, letting go of tension and inviting peace into our being. This simple act of self-care fosters a sense of harmony within, allowing us to navigate life's ebb and flow with grace and poise.

Reconnect: In the aftermath of Holi, amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it's easy to lose sight of our connection to ourselves and others. The Body & SPA oil invites us to pause, to reconnect with ourselves on a deeper level. As we massage the oil into our skin, we are encouraged to tune into the sensations, to be fully present in the moment. This mindful practice not only nurtures our physical bodies but also nurtures our souls, fostering a profound sense of self-awareness and introspection. Through this ritual of self-care, we reaffirm our commitment to ourselves, honoring our bodies, minds, and spirits with love and compassion.

As we bid adieu to the colors of Holi, let us embrace the transformative power of body & SPA lil. In its gentle embrace, we find not just rejuvenation for our skin but also rebalance for our souls. Let us cherish this sacred ritual of self-care, using it as a beacon of light to guide us through life's journey. With each drop of oil, may we reconnect with the essence of who we are, finding solace, strength, and serenity along the way.

MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Union Gas offers EV charging solutions, The Edge Singapore reports. This follows a recent collaboration with Deltrix Limited, a Hong Kong-based charging solutions provider, after signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU).

The essence of this collaboration lies in the company's aspiration to diversify its portfolio to cater to the EV market. The company boasts four EV charging nozzles at its headquarters, 89 Defu Lane 10.

However, Union Gas has ambitious plans to boost this infrastructure by adding a dozen more charging nozzles to the same location within the next two years.

In addition, Union Gas also aims to incorporate charging stations at its Cnergy fuel station located at 50 Old Toh Tuck Road in the foreseeable future.

Furthermore, the company is exploring multiple locations across Singapore to deploy additional charging stations. This expansion extends beyond Singapore, as the MOU with Deltrix includes potential ventures in Japan and the Southeast Asia region.

However, the company intends to solidify its presence in Singapore before expanding into other markets.

Mr Teo Hark Piang, CEO of Union Gas, stated the company's rationale behind this move:

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

""Enjoy the moment,"" said Temple.

In my previous article, I indicated that I was selling CONSOL Energy (CEIX) and re-deploying the capital towards met coal companies instead of thermal coal companies. One of the companies that I have been buying this week is Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC). If one is bullish on the met coal industry, one can start establishing a position in the coming months while prices should languish in the ""shoulder season.""

Warrior Met Coal is an Alabama-based exporter of Australian Premium Low-Vol hard coking coal to the global steel industry. The company has two major mines that produce 7.6 million short tons annually with reserves of over 20 years.

HCC has been a standout performer over the last three years. Shares have tripled over the last three years on the back of higher coal prices.

The company boasts some of the highest coal assets in the United States with a mix of coking coal grades that allow the company to achieve premium prices in the export market.

The main catalyst is the Blue Creek Mine that is currently under development. Once this mine is completed in 2026, the company should generate $647-800 mm of free cash flow. Generating that type of cash flow against a $2.3 billion enterprise value should propel the shares much higher.

Shoulder season in the coal markets refers to the period between the peak and the off peak season. More specifically, in the coal markets, investors have been conditioned to sell in February and buy back later in the summer. It's worked the last three years.

I've highlighted with the blue arrows the weakness of the share prices over the past three shoulder seasons.

Usually, I build a position incrementally by adding 20% of my total position each month until August 15 or so. If I'm trying to establish a 1,000 share position in HCC, I would buy 200 shares per month until mid summer. I expect that I will get a chance to buy HCC in the range of $45-55 during the shoulder season.

There has been some unexpected weakness in the coking coal markets since October 2023. The futures market is also pricing in weakness in to late spring.

It appears that there is some demand weakness out of China. Local Chinese coke producers passed their fifth round of price cuts in March. This month, China's coking coal and coke production fell due to weak steel demand and a decline in pig iron production.

HCC shares do not have the support of share buybacks like other coal companies, particularly Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR). Since HCC is focused on growth and is investing heavily in the Blue Creek Mine, the shares do not have buybacks that can support the share price through the weak shoulder season.

Since coal companies are under represented in ETF's and passive fund flows, many coal investors have focused on share buybacks as a way to unlock value.

Since HCC is using most of its free cash flow for CapEx at the Blue Creek mine there is little hope of any buybacks until 2026.

Without the buyback machine scooping up 7-10% of the float every year, it is likely that HCC will underperform until investors start focusing on how much free cash flow will be generated with the Blue Creek mine.

Interestingly, Warrior has never been a buyback machine. In the 2017-2019 time period most free cash flow was returned to shareholders via dividends. However, once the Blue Creek mine is completed, HCC can either issue special dividends or initiate buybacks.

The Blue Creek mine is one of the largest untouched metallurgical coal reserves in North America. It is a staggering resource with a reserve base of 69.8 million short tons of recoverable reserves and 49.5 million short tons of coal resources (excluding reserves).

It is estimated that Warrior will generate $647-800 mm of free cash flow in 2026 once the Blue Creek Mine is up and running.

As you can see from the chart below production is estimated to increase from 8 million short tons to 17.6 million short tons.

For 2024, company has earmarked $335-390 mm for the continuing development of the Blue Creek Mine. Investors need to be aware that this is a billion dollar project and these types of projects have a tendency to run into cost overruns and delays. The total capex estimate has already moved up from $700 mm to over a billion dollars. One of the big risks to the investment thesis are construction delays and cost overruns. The other big risk is a collapse in coal prices. We all remember coal prices getting cut in half in 2019-2020.

First of all, Warrior Met Coal is a conservatively financed company. The company has $173 mm of debt against an asset base of $2.3 billion. In 2023, the company retired 50% of their senior debt.

In 2023, the company generated $701 mm of operating cash flow. Similar numbers are expected for 2024. The company has an enterprise value that is only 3.3X cash flow. The shares are cheap based on current production levels.

In addition, the company is able to generate significant free cash flows as long as realized coal prices stay in the $200-250/st price range.

However, once you factor in the growth with Blue Creek, the shares become quite bargain if you're able to look forward to 2026 and beyond. Production will almost double to 17.6 million short tons. This alone should result in ~$400 million of free cash flow. Once you add in the $335-395 mm of savings from mine costs you are left with $647-800 mm of free cash flow.

I own Warrior Met Coal with an eye towards 2026. When the Blue Creek Mine is up and running, I expect the company to generate $647-800 mn of free cash flow annually. It is important to note that the company will also not be spending $335-395 mn annually on the mine construction. There will be a boatload of cash available via special dividends or buybacks. With a $2.3 billion enterprise value, HCC will either issue special dividends as they did in 2017-2019 or follow the example of other coal companies and initiate significant buybacks.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Permanent Value,0.1294117647058823,448866790,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/495453927/image_495453927.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

Edward Hawes uses the gas for work and had ordered a replacement fill-up on Thursday, February 15, so that it could be delivered on Monday, March 11.

He tends to order the next load while there is still 20 per cent of the fuel left in the tank, but he was left without gas for five days after the intended date.

This led to Mr Hawes driving his tractor to Calor's distribution centre on Ferry Hinksey Road on Tuesday (March 19) morning to protest.

Equipped with a sign that read ""Calor Gas, where is my delivery?"", he stood alongside his tractor and waited for answers.

""I ran out of gas on Friday, March 15 so I called Calor to notify them of this and they told me they would respond within 48 hours,"" said Mr Hawes.

""I was then told by Calor that there had been a problem with the delivery lorry so that is why the March delivery did not make it.""

The 53-year-old was then told by a neighbour that the Calor delivery lorry was at the park where he lives on the very same Friday.

""I live there but they had not filled my gas tank up which I find alarming as I had made Calor aware of my position earlier that day,"" added Mr Hawes.

""I then went online to see if there was a new delivery date on my account and saw it was now showing Monday, March 18.

""There was no delivery all day and I called Calor twice with the team then told me that a manager would call with an update but I am still waiting.

""I informed them that if nothing would be done then I would protest outside their Oxford depots and here I am.""

Mr Hawes brought his tractor and trailer to the site in Botley to protest as promised along with his homemade sign.

Oxford Mail reached out to Calor for more information on the incident to which the gas company revealed they ended up delivering the product following the protest.

A Calor spokesperson said: ""We apologise to Mr Hawes for the late delivery of his gas which was due to our delivery vehicle breaking down.

Around 10 members of the environmentalist group, who were protesting the plans for the coal mine in Whitehaven, travelled to the MP's Maryport office on Friday March 15, unaware that he was in Westminster at the time.

Jenkinson accused the group of 'rank hypocrisy' after they arrived by car, but Just Stop Oil argued that they were left with little other option due to the current lack of public transport options into Maryport.

Train users were warned earlier this month that services between Workington and Carlisle could be affected for at least six weeks, as urgent repair work takes place on the railway viaduct over the River Derwent in Workington.

Network Rail named climate change as a specific factor behind the damage to the viaduct.

A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: ""Mark Jenkinson accused us of trying to 'force access to his Maryport office' and 'harass his staff' but the reality is we just rang the doorbell to have a discussion.

""He calls us 'lunatics' and that we're from 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' but really he's in the land of make believe when he denies that burning fossil fuels will affect the climate, and that it will affect people all over the world - including here in Cumbria.""

Following the protest, Mr Jenkinson had said: ""It is the case that I am in favour of the Cumbrian coal mine, to support UK steelmaking and reduce the UK's carbon footprint, mitigating the need to import coking coal from overseas and curbing our reliance on hostile foreign states.""

However, it's also been suggested that technology such as electric arc furnaces will 'lead to the successful decarbonisation of UK steel production by 2035', indicating that coal will no longer be needed for steel production.",newsandstar.co.uk,news,News & Star,Jimmy Moorhouse,-0.5137254901960784,448866539,1,https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/resources/images/17867055/,

HYDERABAD: To ease the drinking water problem for the residents of the city, MAUD Principal Secretary M Dana Kishore has instructed the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) to supply water through water tankers even at night.

He asked the authorities to deploy additional staff to work in night shifts and make arrangements for water supply. He said that it has been decided to deliver tankers for domestic needs during the day time and for commercial needs at night time.

Dana Kishore along with HMWS&SB Managing Director C Sudarshan Reddy reviewed the summer action plan of the Water Board here on Friday.

He said that special officers would be appointed to monitor the supply of tankers at night. They would work in coordination and monitor the supply and demand from customers. It was directed to appoint a nodal officer to the division for implementation of the summer plan to supply water. They should regularly monitor consumer demand, water supply, sufficient tankers, drivers etc. and report to the higher authorities.

As the Ramzan season is going on, they want to ensure that there is no problem in water supply to mosques and surrounding areas. Additional tankers and drivers would be deployed to increase the number of tankers to meet the demand coming from consumers. It is suggested to press additional tankers if necessary by holding talks with the tanker association for night shift.

He said that the demand for water tankers has increased due to the depletion of groundwater in the month of February itself. Apart from that, he clarified that there is no problem in water supply. He said that the demand for water tankers is high in 15, 6, 9, and 18 divisions.

So far this month, oil has rallied, with prices surging more than $85 a barrel.

""Oil demand indeed looks stronger this year, but given China's property challenges and the United States' still tight labour market, we struggle to see a meaningful fundamental upside,"" wrote Norbert Rücker, Head Economics and Next Generation Research, Julius Baer, in a note.

""Today's bullishness should eventually reverse. We see oil prices trending back into the $70s.""

Some analysts have recently revised their forecasts on oil demand growth as market sentiments turned upbeat, projecting that supply could be tight later this year.

Just this week, EIA increased its forecast prices for crude oil and petroleum products for the remainder of the year, following the extension of OPEC+ output cuts. It said that, with the production cuts, oil supply will be ""significantly less"" than oil consumption through the first half of 2024.

Oil consumption is dominated by China, North America and Europe.

Rücker said that last year's strong demand in China isn't likely to continue in 2024. He noted that the Chinese property market is facing some challenges that weigh on construction activity.

Besides, the rapid shift to electric vehicles is leading to lesser consumption of road fuel.

""China's crude oil imports trend sideways at elevated levels, with substantial quantities of oil entering storage or being re-exported as fuel or other products,"" Rücker noted.

""Under such preconditions, China's crude oil buying is likely to become more opportunistic and price sensitive.""

In the US, the upside to road fuel consumption seems somewhat limited, given that conditions in the labour market have remained tight, while in Europe, the market is showing ""structurally softer demand.""

""Oil prices should trend lower once the present upbeat mood cools,"" Rücker said.

Mar 23, 2024 Court Stories, Features / Columnists, News, Oil & Gas

Kaieteur News - The Petroleum Activities Act 2023 now requires all holders of petroleum licenses to implement and maintain measures to protect the oil and gas operations from threats and attacks.

The Law, passed in the National Assembly on August 9, 2023 and assented to by President Dr. Irfaan Ali on August 16, 2023, under Part XIII 'Safety, Security and Emergency Response' states that a licensee shall ensure risks inherent in petroleum operations are eliminated or are kept as low as reasonably practicable.

In Section 77 (1) the law makes it explicit, ""The operator of a licence holder's petroleum facilities and infrastructure shall implement and maintain- (a) preventative security measures designed to protect facilities and wells from threats and attacks; and (b) contingency plans to deal with the occurrence of any such attacks.""

The Petroleum Activities Act explains that the security measures shall include measures to control the presence of personnel, equipment and goods at a facility or well.

The Petroleum Activities Act was updated by government to modernize and replace the previous legislation that was established in 1986, decades before Guyana became an oil producing state and long before petroleum was discovered by ExxonMobil in the Stabroek Block.

The New Law introduces significant improvements and safeguards related to safety, emergency response, cross-border unitization, supervision, and monitoring requirements. It also authorises the Minister with Responsibility for Petroleum to prescribe regulations regarding critical administrative and operational aspects of exploration and production activities.

The requirement, for petroleum companies to ensure facilities and wells are protected from threats and attacks, is a new feature of the legislation.

It comes amid tensions between Guyana and Venezuela over the border controversy that was long settled since 1899. Venezuela's President, Nicolas Maduro had ramped up the country's claims over Guyana's mineral rich Essequibo Region last year as his country prepares for national elections.

With the matter still before the World Court, Venezuela issued a new map to its people on December 2, 2023 which shows the Essequibo region being part of the Venezuelan territory.

Another of the president's mandates was the instruction to PDVSA and the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana to create the Essequibo Commission, and proceed to grant licenses for oil, gas and mining exploration. Companies operating in the territory were instructed to leave within three months.

On December 14, 2023, Guyana's President, Dr. Irfaan Ali met with President Maduro in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where both leaders agreed to, among other things, scale back on acts of aggression.

They specifically agreed that both States will refrain, whether by words or deeds, from escalating any conflict or disagreement arising from any controversy between them.

Be that as it may, Venezuela only on Thursday approved the creation of a new state in Guyana's Essequibo.",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,-0.1372549019607843,448866128,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/FPSO.jpg,eng-9418055

Kaieteur News - China's CNOOC Limited had recorded US$17.2 billion (124 billion Yuan) in net income 2023, a dip in profits compared to 142 billion Yuan in 2022 - with earnings included from profits made from Guyana's Stabroek Block.

ExxonMobil Guyana is the operator of the Stabroek Block with a 45% interest, while Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds 30% interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25% interest.

On Thursday, CNOOC said, ""In 2023, despite the slowdown in global economic growth and the decline in international crude oil prices, CNOOC Limited pressed ahead with high-quality development, set new records in both reserves and production and generated bountiful profit.""

The Chinese Government-backed company reported total annual revenue of 416.6 billion Yuan, slightly lower than the 422.23 billion Yuan in 2022. Despite the dip, the company noted, ""Profit-making capabilities remain strong.""

CNOOC disclosed that the Bohai oilfields offshore China remained the largest crude oil production base in China, while Guyana and Brazil continued to serve as the main drivers of the company's overseas production growth.

In his remark, CNOOC Chairman Wang Dongjin, said, ""In 2023, we worked diligently to meet our targets. We have successfully completed all the tasks for the year and achieved new highs on reserves and production. Looking ahead, CNOOC Limited will continue to enhance our energy supply capacity, technological innovation and value creation capabilities, and strive for high-quality development. With our best efforts, we will set new milestones on our way to build a world-class energy company.""

ExxonMobil Guyana announced the discovery of oil in 2015 and swiftly moved to commence production activities by December 2019. Production from the Stabroek Block developments sits above 600,000 barrels per day (bdp) - with Exxon having the Liza 1, Liza 2 and the Payara projects online.

The oil companies have embarked on an aggressive drilling campaign in the Stabroek Block targeting three other developments: Yellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail projects.

Mar 23, 2024 ExxonMobil, News, Oil & Gas

Kaieteur News - With Guyana's oil spill legislation currently being drafted, Vice President (VP), Bharrat Jagdeo on Thursday disclosed that for the past several months the Government of Guyana (GoG) has been examining how countries deal with issues in relation to oil spills.

Jagdeo, during his weekly press conference, highlighted the examination of global practices in handling oil spill incidents to inform the impending legislation. One such oil spill the Vice President mentioned is lessons learned by the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.

According to reports, on March 24, 1989, an oil tanker owned by ExxonMobil Corporation and dubbed the ""Exxon Valdez"" ran aground in a body of water in the Gulf of Alaska. It was heading to Long Beach, California with over 50 million barrels of oil but had hit a well-known navigation hazard in Alaska's waters. The impact of the collision tore open the ship's hull, causing some 11 million gallons of crude oil to spill into the ecologically sensitive location. At the time, it was the largest single oil spill in U.S. waters. Initial attempts to contain the oil failed, and in the months that followed, the oil slick spread, eventually blackening about 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline. It was, and still is, regarded as one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history.

On Thursday, Jagdeo outlined the key components of the proposed legislation, including delineating responsibilities, liabilities, and compensation mechanisms in the event of an oil spill.

""So we have been working at this for a while now, looking at how we strengthen legislatively, so we can have clear legislation on how to tackle these things, there is no ambiguity, just in case these things happen,"" the Vice President said.

He underscored the importance of clarity and fairness, stressing the need for independent mechanism to resolve disputes regarding compensation for spills. He noted, ""Often oil companies argue if the government comes up with a figure for compensation...they will argue (for) a different figure. So an independent fair mechanism for all of those things.""

Jagdeo further explained that the Government's aim is to strengthen the law governing any situation in the event of an oil spill.

""We will determine responsibilities both from the states side and from the parties causing the spill, we will determine liabilities in the act who will be liable for what, we would have to have a mechanism that allows us to immediately tackle the consequences of the spill but also a mechanism that could lead to resolution to things like compensation etcetera,"" Jagdeo told reporters.

The Vice President also addressed the complexities surrounding liability in cases involving vessels hired by oil companies, highlighting the gaps in existing regulations. He said the new law will cater for spills that occur during the transport of petroleum products.

Jagdeo said, ""So if a vessel were to have a blowout, of one of these big vessels transporting oil and gas...they may not be associated with Exxon, this is a company that they hire so who is liable in that instance and how to we enforce the liability all of these are questions that we would look at in the legislation.""

The Vice President also noted that there are lots of things that the Government is working on in relation to regulations for the petroleum sector. He reiterated that the oil spill legislation will be laid in the National Assembly before it heads to recess.

Speaking on the Petroleum Commission, Jagdeo said the government is still to decide on the implementation of the independent body. Outside of that, he said the Government has fulfilled its policy agenda for the oil and gas sector, with new things to come on stream.

ExxonMobil Guyana announced the discovery of oil in 2015 and swiftly moved to commence production activities by December 2019. Exxon is the operator of the Stabroek Block with a 45% interest, while Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds 30% interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25% interest.

Production from the Stabroek Block developments sits above 600,000 barrels per day (bdp) - with Exxon having the Liza 1, Liza 2 and the Payara projects online. The oil companies have embarked on an aggressive drilling campaign in the Stabroek Block targeting three other developments: Yellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail projects. It should be noted that Yellowtail and Uaru have already been approved, while Whiptail is under review awaiting government approval any day now.",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,0.05098039215686279,448866120,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/Jagdeo.jpg,

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto retained the figure skating world title with a stellar performance in Montreal on Friday and became the first woman to win three straight crowns since American Peggy Fleming in 1968. Sakamoto was in fourth place after the short program, but the 23-year-old's dazzling free skate to ""Wild Is The Wind/Feeling Good"" by Lauryn Hill helped her match 1968 Olympic champion Fleming, who won three world titles between 1966-68.

Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Sakamoto's run began with a double axel and a triple Lutz, before a series of intricate combination jumps brought thunderous applause from the crowd at the Bell Centre. ""I was fourth in the short program, so I was a little anxious about that, but today I was in a really good place emotionally,"" said Sakamoto, who finished with 222.96 points. ""I was able to calm down today. I was able to keep focused and do my elements one after the other and I am happy with this result.""

American Isabeau Levito, a world junior champion in 2022, won silver with a score of 212.16 while Chaeyeon Kim of South Korea took bronze with 203.59. Belgium's Loena Hendrickx, who led after the short program, finished fourth after falling while attempting a triple flip.

Earlier on Friday, veteran ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates scored a 90.08 for their rhythm dance routine at the world championships, putting the Americans on the cusp of a second consecutive world title. Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri were in second after notching a 87.52, and home favourites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada held third with 86.51 ahead of Saturday's free dance.

Performing to music by Queen, Chock and Bates drew roars from the crowd for their smooth twizzle sequence, closing rotational lift and sassy attitude. ""We went out there, and I know it sounds cheesy, but to have the time of our lives,"" said Bates. ""We've been looking to a Montreal worlds for a long time. Being here for an 11th world championship, healthy and still enjoying it all, it's the greatest victory of all.""

Chock, 31, and Bates, 35, relocated to Montreal after a disappointing finish at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang. They won their first world championship in Japan last year and their first grand prix final in December.

India has so far largely shielded itself from the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East.

However, recent disturbances in the Red Sea, stemming from attacks by Yemen's Houthis, have begun to impact India's shipping activities, raising concerns within the government.

The persistent attacks initiated on November 19, when the Houthis seized control of a commercial vessel in the Red Sea, are causing apprehension due to the looming prospects of increased freight costs, potentially detrimental to Indian exports.

Additionally, there's concern about a probable surge in crude oil prices and the safety of Indian ships and sailors.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar raised this matter with Iran, a supporter of the Houthis, during a visit to the country in mid-January. Simultaneously, the commerce ministry collaborated with exporters to address their challenges, while the Indian Navy has been mobilized to safeguard Indian vessels.

Approximately 80% of India's trade with Europe, involving vital commodities such as crude oil, auto parts, chemicals, and textiles, traverses the Red Sea route.

However, missile and drone strikes by Yemen's Houthi militants have compelled many shipping companies to reroute their vessels away from the Suez Canal to circumvent the southern tip of Africa.

The finance ministry of India noted in its monthly economic review that a combination of exorbitant freight costs, insurance premiums, and prolonged transit times could significantly inflate the prices of imported goods.

The disruptions could affect India's exports of agricultural commodities, textiles, chemicals, capital goods, marine, and petroleum products, potentially undermining the competitiveness of export prices.

Thus, the finance ministry suggested diversifying trade routes and transportation options to tackle these challenges effectively.

Gauging The Impact

The impact of the crisis on export values in the next financial year remains uncertain, according to the government, as India's financial year spans from April to March.

Despite the challenges to India's strong growth and stable inflation environment, the ministry expressed confidence in the economy's ability to conclude the current financial year on a positive trajectory.

According to the government, the outlook for inflation in the upcoming months is favourable, with increased summer crop sowing expected to help alleviate food prices. While India's retail inflation marginally eased to 5.09% in February, the central bank remains focused on achieving the 4% inflation target.

The government has revised the official gross domestic product growth estimate for the current fiscal year to 7.6% from 7.3%, signalling confidence in the enduring resilience of the Indian economy.

The All-Important Sea Route

The Red Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, is a vital conduit for Asia-Europe container shipments, which represent up to 15% of global trade.

However, because of the Houthi attacks, believed to be retaliation for the war between Israel and Hamas, vessels have had to be rerouted all the way around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, doubling shipping costs and lengthening delivery times by as much as 25%.

For Indian exporters, this is becoming a significant challenge.

Approximately 34% of India's exports are destined for Europe and the eastern coast of the US. With the rerouting of these shipments, ships now have to cover an additional 4,000 to 6,000 nautical miles, resulting in delays of at least two weeks.

The ongoing turmoil in the Red Sea shipping route is also exerting upward pressure on global food prices.

Longer distances for cargo transportation and increased freight rates could potentially escalate costs.

According to the finance ministry's monthly economic review for February 2024, the heightened crude oil prices stemming from the Red Sea crisis may pose risks to India's inflation, economic growth, and the value of merchandise exports.

The economic review, quoting a report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), showed that the Suez Canal witnessed a significant decline in transits -- 42% and 49%, respectively -- in January 2024 compared to peak levels.

Alteration in trade routes - Container ships that typically traverse the Suez Canal are now opting to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope.

By the first half of February 2024, container tonnage crossing the Canal plunged by 82%, while vessel tonnage passing through the Cape of Good Hope surged by 60%.

Increase in distance and operational shift due to ship rerouting - The additional miles covered and days lost due to trade diversion have resulted in supplementary expenses, such as fuel costs and diminished value of time-sensitive cargo.

Moreover, heightened security concerns, including piracy risks, are leading to a surge in insurance and legal claims.

Indications of mounting inflationary pressures - Current container freight rates are approximately half of the peaks observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, continued rises in shipping costs due to disruptions can fuel inflation. Additionally, the crisis could lead to a surge in global food prices, with disruptions in grain shipments from the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Europe posing risks to global food security.

Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group, expressed concerns about the escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly along the crucial Red Sea global shipping route, suggesting that they could potentially instigate a second wave of inflation in 2024.

He noted that disruptions in the supply chain could typically lead to increased expenses for transportation, production, and distribution, which could ultimately be passed on to consumers.

Green further emphasized that as demand surpasses supply, prices may escalate, thereby contributing to inflation, noting that industries heavily reliant on just-in-time inventory systems might be particularly susceptible to such disruptions.

Indian Economy In FY25

The impact of the Red Sea crisis on the Indian economy is also significant

Approximately 80% of India's merchandise trade with Europe traverses through the Red Sea, affecting key sectors such as crude oil, automotive and auto ancillaries, chemicals, textiles, iron, and steel.

The collective impact of escalated freight costs, insurance premiums, and prolonged transit times could substantially inflate the prices of imported goods.

A continuous disruption in trade routes has the potential to affect the capital goods sector, with possible ripple effects leading to undesirable inventory accumulation, as per insights from a CRISIL report cited in the economic review.

The conflict has disrupted the Middle East's fertilizer exports to India, particularly impacting the import of Muriate of Potash from Jordan and Israel.

According to BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, the crisis is expected to influence economic growth and inflation across Asia.

Asian economies like China, Japan, India, and South Korea are among the largest net oil importers globally. Therefore, sustained disruptions in shipping could have adverse effects on Asia.

Additionally, a surge in crude oil prices may pose upward risks to inflation and subsequently impact gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

In the report, the finance ministry noted that the resurgence of demand in advanced economies is anticipated to benefit India positively.

However, India may encounter sector-specific impacts on agricultural commodities, marine products, textiles, chemicals, capital goods, and petroleum products.

To effectively tackle these challenges, there might be a necessity to diversify trade routes and transportation options.

Analysts Analysis

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the Red Sea crisis has prompted Asian refiners to reassess their oil strategies and develop alternative plans to ensure consistent feedstock flows.

Zhuwei Wang, the firm's Asian oil analytics manager, outlined three ways in which the Red Sea crisis affects Asian oil flows.

He mentioned potential obstacles for Russian crude flowing to Asia, cautiousness among exporters of products moving northbound from Asia to Europe, and the likelihood of longer routes leading to increased bunker demand in Asia.

Wang explained that any escalation in the crisis would create hurdles for Russian crude flowing to Asia, compelling buyers to seek substitutes from other sources.

Additionally, exporters of products moving from Asia to Europe are cautiously monitoring developments. Moreover, longer routes may generate incremental bunker demand in Asia.

While immediate impacts on near-term oil supplies seem restricted, refiners are contemplating alternative routes to ensure uninterrupted feedstock supply, potentially resulting in elevated insurance costs and squeezed refining margins.",inventiva.co.in,news,Inventiva,,-0.2392156862745098,448865732,1,https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/India-Inflation.jpg,eng-9417807

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said. PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""",bostonglobe.com,news,The Boston Globe,,-0.2156862745098039,448865209,1,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/Dxt8NlpKLSPERjkhwc3lMsK0Vnw=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/OVC7MAPG4Y7M6PMNGRWFL7YMF4.jpg,eng-9412856

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said. PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

MISSION, Kan. -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,-0.2235294117647059,448864437,1,https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:YWZjYzYxNmItZDRhYy00:NDUzOGYy/landscape/1280,

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Brent futures for May delivery settled at US$85.43, losing 35 cents. US crude settled at $80.63 a barrel, falling 44 cents. Both benchmarks logged less a than 1% change on the week.

""Everyone is watching for what the weekend will bring with Gaza,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC, adding that successful peace talks would prompt Yemen's Houthi rebels to allow oil tankers to pass through the Red Sea.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Blinken met Arab foreign ministers and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo as negotiators in Qatar centred on a truce of about six weeks.

Meanwhile, the US dollar was set for a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's surprise interest rate cut on Thursday bolstered global risk sentiment.

A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies, dampening demand.

While a possible ceasefire meant crude might move more freely globally, a lower U.S. oil rig count and the potential for easing U.S. interest rates helped support prices.

""We are still keeping fresh highs on the table given broad-based expansion in risk appetite that accelerated following the mid-week Fed comments that proved less hawkish than anticipated,"" said Houston-based Jim Ritterbusch, of Ritterbusch and Associates.

U.S. equities, which tend to move in correlation with oil prices, hit record highs after the Federal Reserve ended its regular meeting with no change in U.S. rates on Wednesday.

The U.S. oil rig count fell by one to 509 this week, according to Baker Hughes data, indicating lower future supply.

Money managers, meanwhile, upped their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said, with combined futures and options positions in New York and London rising by 57,394 contracts to 202,624.

The conflict in Eastern Europe also kept oil prices from moving lower. Russia launched the largest missile and drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure of the war to date on Friday, hitting the country's largest dam and causing blackouts in several regions, Kyiv said.

However, chatter has emerged within the market that Russia would further discount its barrels in light of the escalation, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. A steeper discount could make Russian crude more attractive to international buyers.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

""[Large companies] already have systems in place to go beyond what the EPA is requiring, so they're going to sail over these requirements with no trouble,"" Ben Cahill, Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on the sidelines of CERAWeek March 21. ""It's more of a problem for the smaller producers, because many of them are just at the start of their own methane journey and they just don't know what to do about these rules. They haven't sorted through the technology yet.""

The Inflation Reduction Act provided $1.55 billion to give grants and training to smaller companies to help them comply with methane regulations. ""I don't think that money has gotten out the door as fast as people wanted,"" Cahill said. ""A lot of these companies might have some kind of cultural resistance to working with the EPA.""

""The new regulations also took away the grandfathering in of older producing wells,"" Tom Jorden, CEO of Coterra Energy, said in a March 20 panel. Jorden said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the impact on smaller players ""because many of those will not support the kind of retrofitting that companies like ... Coterra can handle. Financially, those wells will just need to be plugged.""

The EPA announced the final rule on methane in December and published it March 8. The rule includes a zero-emissions standard for new controllers, and requirements that routine flaring from new wells be phased out.

A March 15 petition from 24 state attorneys general challenged the rule, which ""imposes expensive and unjustified new technology and monitoring requirements; imposes new storage and transportation requirements; adds new source performance standards; and creates a 'Super Emitter' program that third-party environmental advocacy groups can use to harass producers,"" Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in an accompanying statement.

""Generally, the way things work is EPA gets sued by everybody,"" Cahill said. ""The goal when the EPA puts these things together is to make them as resilient as possible to legal challenges.""

Producers could face hefty charges if they are unable to bring down their methane emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a 0.2% methane emission limit for producers beginning in 2024. It tasked EPA with collecting a Waste Emission Charge for emissions beyond this limit, starting at $900/mt for 2024 emissions and rising to $1,200/mt in 2025 and $1,500/mt in 2026.

Companies producing MiQ-certified natural gas are already meeting the 0.2% threshold, but overall methane emissions from US production are around 1%, Georges Tijbosch the CEO of MiQ, a nonprofit that certifies gas for producers, said March 20. MiQ certifies around 22 Bcf/d of US production and participants include large producers like EQT and Chesapeake.

The EPA is also finalizing rules that will change how companies report their methane emissions, moving away from the old system were they could report modeled emissions. ""That data's wrong. It's too low,"" Cahill said.

""In order to get an accurate estimate of emissions you actually have to go out and measure,"" Matt Watson, EDF's vice president of energy transition, said March 19 at CERAWeek. He praised the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership for helping companies ""get to a really high level, scientifically rigorous measurement.""

When companies in OGMP start the process of measuring in the field, including ""big, sophisticated, well-capitalized companies,"" emissions are often far higher than anticipated, Watson said.",spglobal.com,news,spglobal.com,,0.003921568627450966,448863624,26,,eng-9414921

If you're not sure what kind to get, unrefined or extra virgin coconut oil is the best kind of coconut oil because it goes through minimal processing.

This means extra virgin coconut oil contains more nutrients and beneficial compounds than refined coconut oil.

As a prepper, you should consider stocking up on coconut oil because it has several survival uses. As a bonus, coconut oil does not need refrigeration, so it's the perfect addition to your survival stockpile or bug-out bag. (h/t to Homesteading.com)

If you are experiencing symptoms of dehydration like cracked skin and chapped lips, coconut oil can help.

Apply a bit of melted coconut oil to cracked skin or chapped lips to keep them moisturized. The coconut oil can also help relieve any pain or discomfort.

Coconut oil can be used as a hair mask. Melt some coconut oil in a small bowl, but check the temperature. If it gets too hot, you can burn your scalp.

Slowly massage the warm, melted coconut oil into your scalp and roots. Leave the oil on for an hour and then wash it out.

Coconut oil can support healthy hair because it is a natural conditioner and is great for hair growth and split ends. For a scented conditioner, add a couple of drops of lavender essential oil before applying it to your hair.

If you or someone at home is suffering from deep bruising, apply coconut oil directly to the bruise.

Massage the oil into your skin using small circular motions for about three to four minutes. This can help soothe damaged tissue associated with deep bruising.

Coconut oil has natural cleansing properties that can help with minor cuts and scrapes. To use, simply apply a thin layer of coconut oil directly to the open wound.

Cover the wound with an adhesive bandage to keep it clean. (Related: Natural healing: Survival uses for coconut oil.)

A coconut oil-based salve can help relieve the itchiness and redness of a rash.

A coconut oil salve can also support your body's natural healing process, thanks to its beneficial properties.

Homemade salves and balms are usually made with essential oils and a carrier oil like coconut oil.

Coconut oil is a great carrier oil and can be used to make healing salves and balms after SHTF.

You can restore knives with rusty blades with a bit of coconut oil.

Apply a thick layer of coconut oil to your knife blade. Let it sit for one to two hours then wipe it off. Repeat if necessary.

Before SHTF, you can make DIY candles if you have coconut oil.

Melt the coconut oil until it is liquid. Next, secure a wick into a heat-resistant glass container.

Carefully pour the melted coconut oil into the glass container and make sure the wick stays in place while pouring. Let the coconut oil dry completely until it is solid again, then light the wick as needed.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said. PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Pacific Energy will ""redirect"" the 300 MMcf/d of firm capacity it holds on T-South Line on the Westcoast pipeline system to supply Woodfibre, Cynthia Hansen, Enbridge's president of gas transmission and midstream, said March 20 on the sidelines of CERAWeek by S&P Global. ""We believe and our customers believe that will leave that market -- the industrial load in the Lower Mainland area and then that gas that flows into the Pacific Northwest -- short.""

The Sunrise expansion, which will be done by adding pipeline loops and compression, will ""backfill"" this capacity, but there will be a gap between the two projects. Woodfibre will be in service ""in the later half of 2027, and then we're working to get the T-South expansion into 2028,"" Hansen said. ""So that market's going to be challenged. Some would say that market right now is short just because you have a lot of volatility in the prices depending on the weather patterns, and it's obviously really hard to build pipelines in that area.""

Earlier in CERAWeek, Senator Joe Manchin said a bipartisan deal on legislation for permitting reform was ""back on track and I want to get it done before we go out on the August recess.""

""I am very hopeful that we will see some permitting reform,"" Hansen said. ""One concern I might have is the timing of that reform given that we're going into an election cycle.""

Hansen's feelings were shared with other delegates at CERAWeek. ""I would like to be optimistic,"" said Amy Andryszak, CEO of INGAA, on the sidelines of the conference March 19. ""If Joe Manchin is optimistic, that's a good thing. But I know that it's difficult to pass any major legislation in an election year.""

Rising demand makes pipeline development essential because ""all pipelines pretty much are full,"" Hansen said.

Enbridge expects North American demand to rise to around 140 Bcf/d in 2030 from ""about 120 Bcf right now."" Rising LNG demand will lead growth, but Enbridge sees demand growth from electricity and industry. ""There's lots more opportunities for domestic demand as well as of course the LNG exports.""

Multiple speakers at CERAWeek, including EQT's Toby Rice, have pointed to demand from data centers, turbocharged by AI, as being a key driver of power sector demand growth.

Enbridge owned gas utilities in Canada are seeing requests from data centers, Hansen said. ""We're feeding into those utilities that are getting those requests. We haven't, with our main lines, had any direct requests from data centers yet, but we would feed into those markets.""

Cheniere COO Corey Grindal said in a March 20 panel that rising demand would cure pipeline developers of the ""skittishness"" created by the difficult planning system. ""You'll continue to see demand develop, whether it be electricity, whether it be LNG, whether it be industry coming back to the United States. You're going to start seeing the market send signals. And at some point the signals will get there where people are willing to take the chance, to take the risk, to develop additional infrastructure.""",spglobal.com,news,spglobal.com,,0.09019607843137245,448863543,1,,

Describing surging demand in Dominion Energy's Virginia and North Carolina footprint, Robert Blue, Dominion Energy chairman, president and CEO, cited surging data center demand in Northern Virginia as particularly challenging.

""If you looked back a decade, we had roughly 500 megawatts of data center demand, which was a lot for one industry at the time,"" Blue said during a panel discussion at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference.

""This year, we're more than six times that, about 3 GW,"" Blue said, whose company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Much of the data center is in northern Virginia's Loudon County, which Blue said has the largest data center concentration in the world.

""Looking forward, we expect to more than quadruple that over the course of the next 15 years, so it will be 13 gigawatts of data center demand,"" Blue said. ""Just last year, the 15 data centers we connected had a capacity of nearly a gigawatt.""

Texas was ""already having substantial growth,"" before data centers and the electrification of the economy boosted demand, said Houston-based Larry Coben, NRG Energy chairman, interim president and CEO. The Dallas-Fort Worth area has ""very, very strong fiber"" connections to the Internet, which is boosting data center activity in the area, Coben said.

""We're going to continue to see rapid growth here in Texas,"" Coben said. ""Our customers are electrifying much more rapidly than you would think.""

Dominion plans to cope with this fast-growing load by developing a 2.6-GW wind project off the coast of Virginia which Blue said should start supplying power to the state in 2026.

Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE, a power generation and trading company based in Essen, Germany, said the cost of developing offshore wind in US waters is ""probably 30% higher than in Europe, because the industry is not that mature.""

But Blue said Dominion's offshore project should be on time and on budget.

""By the time we went to our regulators and ask for approval we had locked in our positions in a supply chain and we had firm contracts on the other side, which helped give some a cost certainty,"" Blue said.

Dominion is also building about 1 GW of solar power annually, maintaining its seven units of nuclear power and studying the potential use of small modular nuclear reactors. Regarding the latter, Blue said Dominion must ensure that the technology ""cost pencils out for our customers.""

""But if we look at as we look at the waterfront for dispatchable, carbon-free electricity, it would be a mistake not to look at nuclear,"" Blue said. ""It just has to be done in the right way from a cost perspective.""

Permitting can also constrain development from the federal to the local level, Blue said, even for siting renewable projects. Local objections can include the loss of agricultural land, aesthetic objections and even philosophical concerns, Blue said, ""so it can become very interesting.""

NRG's Coben said he attended a conference around 2014, where he ""was told the solution to all our energy problems was to build wind in North Dakota and then shipping it to load.""

""And then I asked the question, 'Has anyone here besides me ever tried to permit a transmission line?'"" Coben said. ""Of course, the answer was no. I started trying to count off the number of permits you would need, and when I got to three digits, people left on the coffee break. So, you know we need permitting reform. ... Everybody would like clean, efficient, free power that they don't have to see or think about, and we're all working on that, but we haven't quite found yet.""

NRG has three ""shovel-ready"" natural gas-fired generation projects, one baseload combined-cycle plant and two peakers totaling 1.5 GW of capacity, Coben said, and NRG hopes to use some recently approved low-interest financing from the Texas Energy Fund approved by voters in November.

""I think the only thing we're waiting for is that Texas Public Utility Commission is supposed to issue regulations surrounding loan programs at the end of this month,"" Coben said.",spglobal.com,news,spglobal.com,,0.2,448863528,1,,

It hasn't been the greatest past 24 hours for the New Orleans Pelicans. Not only did they suffer one of their most disappointing defeats of the season on Thursday night, a 121-106 loss against the Orlando Magic, they had to hold their breath as they waited for the official diagnosis on Brandon Ingram's injury (a knee contusion). But on Friday night, the Pelicans got back on track after they defeated the Miami Heat, 111-88.

This time, there were no extracurriculars to steal the show in what was a routine win for the Pelicans. As one would recall, their prior contest against the Heat (a 106-95 loss) was defined by a heated altercation involving Jimmy Butler and Naji Marshall that spilled over into a boxing match between Jose Alvarado and Thomas Bryant.

Now, the Pelicans were able to make the most of their opportunity to get one back over the Heat. And in so doing, they even turned Butler's words against him in an A-plus act of trolling from the Pelicans' Twitter (X) account.

""We're just a better team,"" their tweet reads.

This statement is in reference to what Jimmy Butler said after the Heat took an 11-point victory over the Pelicans back on February 23. Butler boldly proclaimed that the Heat were ""a better team"" and that they'll ""beat them next time too"". Clearly, this did not age well, and the administrator of the Pelicans' Twitter (X) account makes sure to feed Butler back his words.

Without Brandon Ingram, many expected that the Pelicans will be heavily reliant on Zion Williamson to shoulder first-option duties. However, Williamson, despite the glowing reviews he has received as of late, struggled against the Heat, scoring just four points on 2-7 shooting.

Nonetheless, the Pelicans still made light work of the Heat thanks to CJ McCollum, Jose Alvarado, and Naji Marshall. McCollum dropped 30 points, continuing the Pelicans' trend of winning basketball when he scores plenty, while Alvarado and Marshall, the two most prominent Pelicans players involved in the February 23 scuffle, combined for 30.

Replacing a player of Ingram's caliber was always going to take a team effort. With the playoffs approaching, the Pelicans will not be rushing Ingram back in his recovery amid a two-week minimum absence, so the New Orleans supporting cast will have to continue their strong play moving forward as they remain in the bubble for homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs.

It's around this time of the year when Heat fans expect their teams to hunker down and play their best brand of basketball. But over the past few weeks, the Heat have struggled mightily. The team's depth is being tested heavily amid injuries to Tyler Herro and Kevin Love, among others, and the result on Friday night was a discombobulated effort in a crushing 23-point blowout loss against the Pelicans.

Head coach Erik Spoelstra loves talking about grinding out wins even when the team is ""in the mud""; on Friday night, they were stuck in quicksand, unable to get anything going. Credit must go to the Pelicans' defense, but the Heat will still be disappointed with themselves after shooting a poor 36 percent from the field and 28 percent from deep.

Heat star Jimmy Butler and head coach Erik Spoelstra and spoke after the game to reflect on what went wrong for the team as the regular season comes closer and closer to the end.

Butler would lead Miami with only 17 points in what was a frustrating night for himself and the rest of the team as they shot 36 percent from the field and 27.7 percent from three-point range. The featured Heat star would say that the performance from the team was similar to the past where the offense dictates how they are on defense.

""It's just a retelling of what's happened to us a couple of times this season where whenever we don't make shots, we tend to let our offense dictate our defense in the sense of we don't guard nobody,"" Butler said. ""We don't hustle as often as we should and the game gets very ugly when were doing what we're not supposed to be doing.""

Spoelstra talks about how Pelicans ""flattened"" Heat

The Heat would start the game out hot as they lead by double-digits, but it quickly turned around come the second half where they continued to struggle from the field and New Orleans didn't let up on the gas pedal. Spoelstra spoke to the media after the game and said that New Orleans' zone defense ""flattened us out.""

""I thought we started the game out great, those first four or five minutes they went to the zone, that definitely flattened us out. And then from there, our level of energy, detail, and willingness to go to different layers of our offense was not great and then obviously it always works a little bit different if you knock down shots,"" Spoelstra said. ""There were some stretches during first half of that we had some good looks, or when several empty possessions and they're packing in the paint, staying in the zone and I would've done that too. There was some detailed things where we didn't just only have to live live with those in our aggressiveness and body movement, player movement, those were not examples of our best body of work and when they made us pay the price.""

Spoelstra talks about Miami's defensive performance against Pelicans

It was a mixed bag on the defensive side of the ball as Miami held down the Pelicans most explosive player in Zion Williamson to four points, but on the other hand CJ McCollum would score 30 points. Spoelstra said to ClutchPoints that while the first half was ""in our wheelhouse,"" the second was a different story and complimented McCollum for his performance.

""Throughout the first half, it was in our wheelhouse, it's always tough to look at things objectively, you feel it. You know, when they're going on runs, but we push that thing back, there's always gonna be ups and downs. We pushed to 46 to 42, that seems like a game in the 90s,"" Spoelstra said. ""There was a tough start of the third quarter defensively and offensively. And then we just had to dig and dig and dig the rest of that quarter and we did show some moments where we were able to do that, but not enough and McCollum was very good in those isolation situations, he was able to get to spots and shot make. And also when we're in the zone, he hit some big ones that made us think twice about staying in that.""

Another loss at home for the Heat

With Friday night being the start of the four-game home stand, this could've been the beginning of a turnaround for Miami's performance at home with a middling record of 17-15 heading into the game. However, they drop another one inside the Kaseya Center as Butler said to ClutchPoints that whether it's at home or on the road, ""we have a job to do.""

""Home or away, we have a job to do, we don't think anybody is scared to come in here and play us, don't think people are scared to play us on the road either,"" Butler said. ""Hopefully in the coming games we figure it out, put our heads down and get to work cause we definitely gotta start winning if we want to be where we want to be.""

Miami now drops to 38-32 on the season which now falls the team to the eighth seed in a tightly-packed Eastern Conference.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

All of India's refiners are now refusing to take Russian crude carried on PJSC Sovcomflot tankers due to US sanctions, further complicating the trade that has flourished since the invasion of Ukraine two years ago.

Private and state-run processors including the biggest Indian Oil Corp. have stopped taking cargoes if they're on Sovcomflot tankers, said people familiar with the matter. Refiners are scrutinising the ownership of each ship to make sure they're not affiliated with the company, or other sanctioned groups, they added, asking not to be named because the information is private.

The broader pushback follows a similar move by India's biggest private refiner, Reliance Industries Ltd., reported earlier this week. The heightened scrutiny on the tanker giant appears to have also swept up other oil ships carrying Russian oil, with two vessels waiting several weeks off the South Asian coast without any indication of when they will unload.

Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp., Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. 49% owned by Russia's Rosneft PJSC -- didn't immediately reply to emails seeking comment.

Sovcomflot declined to comment on its operational activities.

Last month, the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Sovcomflot and identified 14 crude oil tankers in which the state-controlled firm has an interest. That came on top of wider measures already imposed on non-Sovcomflot ships and Russia-friendly companies since October for violations of a Group of Seven cap on the price of Russian oil.

India has been a major buyer of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine, but tighter enforcement of US sanctions has disrupted the trade and led to refiners seeking more expensive crude from other regions such as the US. Sovcomflot said this week that the penalties were putting pressure on its operations.

The Sovcomflot issue means there are fewer tankers to deliver Russian crude, which has led to discounts for the nation's oil narrowing to compensate for higher freight costs, the people said.

A ""shadow fleet"" of aging tankers is keeping Russian oil flowing. Bloomberg set out to uncover the network of intermediaries working to sell the Kremlin's oil while getting rich in the process.

The discount to comparable supplies blew out to $30 a barrel after the war, but that's narrowed and is currently about $2-$4 for Indian buyers. The South Asian nation is still expected to take large volumes of Russian crude this month, with Kpler estimating imports of 1.8 million barrels a day -- the highest since July.

About 1.5 million barrels of Urals crude were shipped so far on Sovcomflot vessels in March, down from 4.4 million barrels in January and 4.7 million barrels in February, according to shipping data compiled by Bloomberg. Some ships have yet to show destinations so the final figure could rise.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said. PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro's need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

''You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ''You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.''

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

''They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.''

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag'' stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ''goin' old school!''

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

''Write down key phone numbers just in case,'' advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

''Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,'' Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ''Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.''

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ''This is nuts,'' he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,''' said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ''So I can understand the importance of planning,'' he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,'' said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

This was contained in a statement the ministry issued at the weekend.

According to the statement, Adelabu said the 2023 Electricity Act has opened up opportunities for sub-national governments to invest in the electricity value chain. He expressed happiness at the initiative by the Sokoto State government and promised to ensure the take-off of the plant within the shortest possible time.

Brent futures for May delivery settled at $85.43, losing 35 cents. U.S. crude settled at $80.63 a barrel, falling 44 cents. Both benchmarks logged less a than 1% change on the week.

""Everyone is watching for what the weekend will bring with Gaza,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC, adding that successful peace talks would prompt Yemen's Houthi rebels to allow oil tankers to pass through the Red Sea.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Blinken met Arab foreign ministers and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo as negotiators in Qatar centred on a truce of about six weeks.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was set for a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's surprise interest rate cut on Thursday bolstered global risk sentiment.

A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies, dampening demand.

While a possible ceasefire meant crude might move more freely globally, a lower U.S. oil rig count and the potential for easing U.S. interest rates helped support prices.

""We are still keeping fresh highs on the table given broad-based expansion in risk appetite that accelerated following the mid-week Fed comments that proved less hawkish than anticipated,"" said Houston-based Jim Ritterbusch, of Ritterbusch and Associates.

U.S. equities, which tend to move in correlation with oil prices, hit record highs after the Federal Reserve ended its regular meeting with no change in U.S. rates on Wednesday.

The U.S. oil rig count fell by one to 509 this week, according to Baker Hughes data, indicating lower future supply.

Money managers, meanwhile, upped their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said, with combined futures and options positions in New York and London rising by 57,394 contracts to 202,624.

The conflict in Eastern Europe also kept oil prices from moving lower. Russia launched the largest missile and drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure of the war to date on Friday, hitting the country's largest dam and causing blackouts in several regions, Kyiv said.

However, chatter has emerged within the market that Russia would further discount its barrels in light of the escalation, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. A steeper discount could make Russian crude more attractive to international buyers.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ''Swifties'' lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ''the Taylor Swift effect.'' Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

''Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,'' said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

''It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,'' Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

''The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,'' said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

''I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,'' said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

''If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,'' Beray Armond said. ''We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.''

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

In Minnesota, Utilities Have to Share 10-Year Visions","The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission last month voted to require gas utilities to file long-range resource plans, similar to those used for electric utilities.

No one knows what a gas utility will look like a quarter-century from now, as many states near deadlines for their 2050 climate goals.

In Minnesota, though, state regulators will soon expect utilities to at least have a vision for the next decade.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted last month to require long-range resource planning from the state's three largest gas utilities.

Similar to a process that's long been used for electric utilities, gas utilities will need to periodically submit plans showing load forecasts under various scenarios and how they intend to meet that demand in a way that's safe, reliable, and affordable -- and in line with the state's policies.

""An IRP (integrated resource plan), just like it happens on the electric side, informs the level and type of cost-effectiveness and a framework for utility investment,"" Commission Chair Katie Sieben said. ""The hope is that by having the state's three largest natural gas utilities file IRPs, it will provide transparency and more intentional decision-making in the years to come.""

The decision stemmed from a yearlong investigation by the commission into fallout from a February 2021 cold snap that caused extreme gas price spikes across much of the country.

Utilities in a handful of other states also file gas resource plans, including Oregon, which has had a similar process since 1989. In Minnesota, utilities typically submit annual plans for the upcoming winter season and offer data on changes in natural gas consumption. Investments in gas infrastructure are often discussed in rate cases.

After a six-hour meeting that featured more than 100 decision options, the PUC began drawing parameters for the data and information it will seek from Xcel Energy, CenterPoint Energy and Minnesota Energy Resources Corp. The plans will include projections for low, medium and high natural gas demand and pricing. They will also model energy efficiency initiatives as a potential resource.

""I think that's important in the long term for helping the gas sector meet our overall (state) decarbonization goals,"" Sieben said.

Looking to a net-zero future

The Center for Energy and Environment worked with Xcel Energy, the Department of Commerce and the Laborers' International Union of North America on an approach to natural gas planning that heavily influenced the commission.

The center's director of policy, Audrey Partridge, said asking for natural gas utilities to look out to 2050 remains difficult ""because the quality of the data falls apart."" A 10-year time frame ""is significantly longer than any planning on the gas system we've done to date.""

Though the plans don't go as far as some clean energy and consumer advocates wanted to see, they're hopeful the process, along with recent state laws encouraging gas utilities to diversify and decarbonize their businesses, will help make progress on state climate goals and avoid stranding customers with the cost of infrastructure that may not be needed in the future.

Annie Levenson-Falk, executive director of ratepayers' advocacy group Citizens Utility Board, said the plans are ""essential, given, particularly given all of the transition and uncertainty in the gas industry. It's necessary, and we're very happy to see this move forward.""

The natural gas market is in a state of flux, Levenson-Falk said. The growth of electric air source heat pumps is expected to cut into gas demand in the coming years. So will federal and state incentives encouraging geothermal and district heating systems.

Minnesota's ""future of heat"" could eventually lead to natural gas being used only for the coldest days, Levenson-Falk said. As more customers switch to electric heating sources, there's a risk that the cost of maintaining the natural gas system would ""fall on households that could least afford it.""

The resource plans will help regulators see the ""big picture"" and how utilities are planning for it, she said. When gas utilities make investments, they often consider a 40-year timeline. But if gas sales decline, ratepayers will still have to pay for that infrastructure, Levenson-Falk said.

Clean energy and consumer organizations said natural gas utilities should consider a 2050 end-year because that's Minnesota's goal for carbon neutrality.

""We want the commission to be able to consider if they're (gas utilities) putting in a 40 year pipe today, what will the utilization look like in 15 to 20 years?"" Levenson-Falk said. ""But they didn't go that far.""

'Basically making it up'

The natural gas sector is much more volatile than the electricity marketplace, with ""so many unknowns,"" Sieben said. That led the commission not to require utilities to propose a ""net zero"" future advocated by clean energy organizations. Commissioners also expressed concerns that net zero may impact the system's reliability.

The commission decided utilities will need to consider externalities such as the societal cost of carbon pollution in the planning process.

""I think that is going to create a sea change in terms of opening up more opportunities for cleaner resources and reducing emissions on the gas side,"" Partridge said.

Marketing Manager Kevin Pranis of the Laborers District Council of Minnesota & North Dakota said his union eventually supported the commission's scope for gas planning. But he warned that no ""magic"" in planning would offer a perfect path toward reducing natural gas use.

By planning more than ten years out, ""you're basically making it up,"" Pranis said. Even the idea of reducing natural gas piping cannot occur unless peak energy demand changes. He believes the distribution system will continue to operate for years but carry less natural gas.

""You need a fully functioning gas system until the day you don't need it,"" Pranis said.

Fresh Energy's managing director of buildings, Joe Dammel, said utilities have long forecasted continued natural gas consumption increases despite contrary evidence. Nor have they had to include Minnesota's 2050 carbon neutrality goals in their thinking.

Energy News Network is an independent journalism service of Fresh Energy.

The growth of natural gas ""is at odds with, I think, a lot of the emerging policy concerns about the energy transition, customer preference and changes to the marketplace,"" he said.

The plans will allow regulators to determine whether natural gas investments will be sensible in an uncertain future, he said. ""Gas resource planning is an attempt to provide the commission and other stakeholders with a picture of potential futures,"" Dammel said. ""Saving customer dollars and keeping rates low is something planning can facilitate.""

Dammel still believes the final rules missed opportunities to gather important data. For example, he said that utilities will have to disclose potential new infrastructure investments but not the costs of replacing existing gas distribution systems, representing a significant portion of their spending.

Still, the natural gas resource planning ""is a positive first step,"" Dammel said.

The commission, however, might someday ask for net-zero planning.

""That's the direction that we need to head,"" Sieben said. ""But are we ready to be there yet? No, but I wouldn't be surprised if we, in the years to come, do get there and start to plan for a net-zero future in a more deliberate manner.""

The commission continues to take comments and has an August meeting set to further refine natural gas resource planning, including when the requirement will begin.",goodmenproject.com,news,The Good Men Project,,0.1843137254901961,448862708,1,https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/imattsmart-SYdhFwICWJU-unsplash.jpg,

Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert -- and now her phone won't stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift's concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of ""Swifties"" lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift's attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died.

Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil's justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world.

Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it ""the Taylor Swift effect."" Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio's metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides' death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio's public administration,"" said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington.

Brazil's summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government's meteorology institute.

The heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature -- hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift's concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

""It's worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there's no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,"" Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas -- urban, working-class neighborhoods -- didn't pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio's Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

""The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,"" said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise.

Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel's conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America's biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well.

""I had to. I didn't know how to live with the lack of water,"" said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides' death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday -- the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil's justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana's administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift's November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood -- and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn't get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio's nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

""If you don't have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you're basically condemning your population to illness or death,"" Beray Armond said. ""We still need to improve, but it's better than before, when we had nothing.""

Inside a discreet Lakewood building, Patrick Mazzola sought treatment for his substance use disorder, and hopes it is the last time.

When Mazzola was a teenager in Ohio, he dislocated his shoulder while playing basketball. Once he could no longer play sports, he started drinking.

""That was the stepping stone. And then I remember taking my first Percocet,"" Mazzola remembered. ""This was at the beginning of the opioid epidemic, right after high school for me. So I took a lot of painkillers prescribed. That was the beginning of the end for me.""

Mazzola said he spent the majority of last year sober, but was offered a new supplement while at a head shop one day. He had no idea what would happen next.

""For the first... about year of doing them, it was very light, doing a couple pills here and there, and then it escalated very fast. When my brain started building a tolerance to it, then we're up to about a bottle and a half,"" Mazzola said. ""Neptune's Elixir, and there's a couple other goofy names for it, but they're being sold as a supplement. It's not a supplement. It is a drug and it is going to kill us.""

Mazzola decided he wanted to get better once and for all in February of this year.

""I had given up everything and, and looked inside myself and just asked if I wanted to keep living,"" Mazzola said. ""And then I came here. And this is a fantastic place, and they have helped me tremendously with so much.""

He was admitted to AspenRidge Recovery in late February. Mazzola was their first patient who came to the outpatient treatment center struggling with an addiction to tianeptine.

""This pill is the devil,"" Mazzola said. ""The withdrawal is the worst thing God ever created. And I've withdrawn off drugs. It is awful. Death seemed better than this.""

Tianeptine is colloquially called gas station heroin.

""People call it gas station heroin, because it is a weak opioid antagonist that activates the same areas in your brain that opiates and opioids do as well. And if you take a high enough dose of it, you can get very similar effects,"" explained Steve Sarin, the communications director of AspenRidge Recovery. ""You can get it at gas stations, not all gas stations, but you can buy tianeptine at gas stations, head shops, convenience stores. It's very widely available here in Colorado.""

The substance is sold under various brand names, and Sarin said it is marketed as a supplement.

""Tianeptine is a substance that was first developed in the 1980s to treat depression and anxiety,"" said Sarin. ""It's been approved for use in a few countries around the world but it is not currently approved by the FDA for any use in the United States.""

In fact, the FDA has issued a warning to consumers about tianeptine due to ""serious risks.""

Members of Congress, including Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, signed a letter sent to the FDA urging them to immediately act on tianeptine. The letter stated that several states have taken steps to either ban or strictly control tianeptine, which include Alabama, Michigan, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Florida, and Kentucky. Colorado has not.

""Ultimate responsibility lies with the United States Congress. The Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate most supplements, which tianeptine falls under. But, they've repeatedly asked Congress for the authority to do it,"" Sarin said. ""The last time they [the FDA] asked for the authority to regulate substances like this was in 2022. But the trade groups that represent the manufacturers lobbied Congress and were successful at killing that aspect of the bill... Their 2024 budget request also seeks the authority to regulate these substances. It hasn't passed yet, hasn't been debated yet. So, we'll see if they make any progress on that.""

Sarin expects to see several states banning substances like tianeptine, but said it can be difficult because a manufacturer can tweak the chemical structure and keep selling what is essentially the same product.

""Right now, it's the Wild West when it comes to some of these unregulated supplements on the market. I think we should call on Congress to do what we all elected them to do, and look out for the American people,"" said Sarin.

Mazzola agreed, and said Coloradans need to know about tianeptine before the problem is too far gone.

""Why can't we make this illegal, at least give people a heads up?"" asked Mazzola. ""There's not one good thing coming from this drug, not one single good thing.""

This time, Mazzola believes his treatment is extremely different from in the past. He attributes it to AspenRidge's emphasis on mental health treatment alongside substance use disorders.

""Mental health is first and foremost, with any addict,"" said Mazzola.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

-- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

-- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Featured Local Savings

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

-- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

-- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

-- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.

ZIMBABWE'S mineral wealth is a fluck of nature. Its earth is packed with such metal ores as gold, lithium, diamond, granite and coal along the vast seams in this part of the southern African country.

Throughout the colonial period, colonisers have exploited and extracted these mineral resources.

Four decades after Zimbabwe attained its independence the resources remain vast.

However, residents of Hwange have a sad story to tell as the effects of coal mining activities by some Chinese-owned mining companies that have gradually disrupted the environment, causing ecological damage and human wildlife conflict.

Irreversible ecological degradation risk

Marlvin Daka, team leader for Vostale Creatives Trust, a community-based organisation that promotes environment conservation in Hwange, says there are more than 14 private-owned Chinese mining companies operating in Hwange district involved in coke, coal and brick making production.

In the mining town of Hwange, Matabeleland North province, community members say they are suffering from a deteriorating environment, air and water pollution as well as rising temperatures due to the coal mining activities taking place in their communities.

Hwange district, once a thick forest and home to the country's largest wildlife resercve, the majestic Hwange National Park, has gradually turned into a mining town due to the mining concessions dished out by the Government of Zimbabwe to companies such as Zhong Jiang coal mining, Zambezi Coal and Gasification, Tutu Investments, contracted by the government under the Hwange Colliery Company to improve electricity generation capacity in the country.

Daily thick grey-dark mist of dusty clouds hover the atmosphere in the district of Hwange as trucks ferry coal from mining shafts to the Hwange power station as the Government of Zimbabwe through its power generating companies seek to improve electricity generation capacity for the country and for exports.

Hwange communities blame the Chinese-owned companies for the devastating impact of coal mining on the ecosystem and biodiversity. They say the coal mining activities are ""contributing to climate change, environment degradation and water as well as air pollution"".

Lazarus Tshuma, a 38-year-old livestock farmer in the Dinde community, is one of the many villagers affected by mining activities in the area.

Dinde community is in ward 14 under Hwange Rural District Council. The community and many other communities in the district such as Deka and Lusumbami have been subjected to environment destruction, water and air pollution, with villagers demanding relocation due to Chinese mining operations.

""Dingson Colliery, Zhong Jian Investments, Tutu Chilota Collieries are some of the Chinese companies contracted by Hwange Colliery Company Limited involved in coal mining projects in the rural district of Hwange. Their mining activities are very destructive in nature as they affect biodiversity and livelihoods of community members,"" Tshuma says.

Zim-China mining relations

China has been one of Zimbabwe's main investors in the mining sector. Since the late former President Robert Mugabe's administration, China has been a major political ally of the Zimbabwe government under the ""Look-East"" policy aimed at boosting the country's economy following economic sanctions imposed by Western countries as a result of the country's tainted governance and human rights record.

The government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, when it came into power in 2017, embarked on a policy drive to attract foreign direct investment to promote economic recovery and growth aimed towards becoming a middle-income economy by 2030 as embodied in the mantra"" ""Zimbabwe is open for business.""

Under the mantra, mining is a key anchor to the achievement of this vision, and this is reflected in key policy documents like the US$12 billion mining economy by 2023 Strategy. China naturally emerged as a key investor with significant investments in critical sectors such as mining.

China funding

Daka says Chinese-owned firms are some of the companies contracted by the government of Zimbabwe to carry out their operations on State land doing coal mining on behalf of the government.

""Chinese nationals with special grants issued by the President of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa, for exploration have toured villages, drilling without engaging locals or conducting environment impact assessment,"" Daka says.

Villagers are now subjected to forced relocations and displacements to pave way for mining explorations within their communities. Main sources of drinking water for human and livestock, mainly the Nyantuwe and Deka rivers have been affected by pollution due to the mining exploits, added Daka.

The Mines and Minerals Act states that cpecial grants give the holder the right to carry out mining operations within an area which has been reserved. A special grant is issued by the president upon recommendations by the Minister of Mines.

Chinese-owned companies with reported close links to the president, politicians and the government have been granted mining rights through the special grants, while subcontracting smaller companies in other locations. The government in 2017, extended the tenure of the special grants for the Chinese-owned Zambezi Gas Zimbabwe (Pvt) limited for a period of 25 years to 2042.

Civil society groups' response

The Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association (Zela), an environmental law organisation seeking to promote environmental, economic and cultural rights of communities in southern Africa, states that The Mines and Minerals Act of Zimbabwe gives too much power to the Mines minister to offer tax exemptions to mining companies without public or parliamentary scrutiny for appropriateness.

Zela states that the existing old and colonial piece of legislature does not deal with environmental protection, transparent issuance of mining rights and public disclosure of mining revenues.

They held further that: ""State participation in mining through state owned companies has led government to abdicate its duty to protect the people. Mining causes loss of land, displacement of communities without compensation, pollution of rivers and loss of livelihood sources.""

Farai Muguwu, the executive of the Centre for Natural Resource Governance, a research and advocacy civil society organisation that promotes governance of natural resources and equity in marginalised communities, says: ""Coal mining is being initiated by Chinese companies contracted by the government through Hwange Colliery Company to boost electricity generation in the country. Such mining companies, such as South Mining Company are in operation on State land and communities come closer to residential areas. Their operations although approved by the government, are destructive in nature affecting communities and livelihoods of people and livestock.""

Residents of Hwange town and its vicinity are complaining of coal dust pollution caused by blasting and trucks that carry coal to the coking plants and power stations, and water pollution along the Deka River.

Emelia Mukombwe, like many other villagers whose homes are 200 meteres from the mining activities, claims she is exposed to coal dust in her home and is now worried she may develop respiratory infections or lung diseases. According to Emelia, when the Chinese-owned companies are doing their unscheduled blasting, they affect people including schoolchildren attending class.

""Coal dust can take more than two hours to settle and this interrupts learners in class. Coal blasting also exposes black shell, which then pollutes the air and sometimes causing underground fires exposing community members to injuries. In terms of safety health and environment, Hwange community has been affected,"" Mukombwe says.

Environment and climate policies

The Greater Whange Residents Trust, an association that advocates and lobbies for good municipal service and local governance has recorded an increase in the number of children burnt by coal fires. According to the association, coalmines endanger the lives of Hwange residents and cattle due to fatal pollution.

According to the Zimbabwe National Development Strategy 1, January 2021 -- December 2025, Zimbabwe is party to international conventions and protocols to pursue national interest and sustainable development on climate change, environment and wildlife conservation as well as human rights. But the country seems to have gradually suspended such commitments in favour of robust investments in the mining sector and the quest to meet a US$12 billion mining economy by 2023.

Fidelis Chima, chairperson for Greater Whange Residents Trust, says the government has been petitioned on several occasions by civil society, environmental and climate change activists raising concern on issuing mining and exploration rights to Chinese mining companies without carrying out Environmental Impact Assessments.

""There has been a rising concern on government's response in protecting and preserving the environment. The government has been petitioned against issuing mining concessions to Chinese owned companies, but it has remained silent despite the threats of coal-seam fires and environment destruction.

""Lack of government's response on the community concerns shows that the government is focused on its US$12-billion-dollar mining economy by 2023 target at the expense of ensuring human rights, sustainable development and environment protection amid the effects of climate change,"" says Fidelis Chima of Greater Whange Residents Trust.

Regardless of being a signatory to Climate Change conventions such as the Paris Agreement aimed at reducing global warming, Zimbabwe relies on fossil fuels for electricity generation and has been intensifying its investments in the industry amid worldwide resolutions to phase it out.

Coal, a metallic black sedimentary rock that is part of fossil fuel family, releases carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming and climate change.

The Environment Management Agency (EMA), a statutory entity responsible for ensuring sustainable utilisation of natural resources and protection of the environment, seems to be toothless.

EMA was established through the EMA Act, Chapter 20:27, which also provides for the establishment of the National Environmental Council, the Environmental Management Agency and Environment Management Board. It provides for the formulation of environmental quality standards and environmental plans, for environmental impact assessments audit and monitoring of projects and for other matters in relation to management and conservation of the environment.

The Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association, however, believes EMA has been failing to apply and balance the concepts of business and human rights as enunciated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and has not been compliant with and monitoring of Environmental Impact Assessments to address potential impacts and risks on communities by mining companies and environmental authorities has been very weak.

EMA Matabeleland province authorities admitted to receiving reports that Chinese mining companies where discharging their mining water into rivers polluting water sources and were fined for contravening Environmental Protection Orders in terms of section 37 of the on disposal of effluent in a manner as to cause environmental pollution.

EMA's Matabeleland provincial manager, Chipo Mpofu-Zuze says the agency is working with mining companies to ensure that measures are put in place to effectively reduce pollution, environment and ecological damage. ""The Environmental Management Agency has been engaging with the Zimbabwe Power Company in Hwange to find ways of minimising dust pollution in the mining zone. EMA has also been working with mining companies to ensure that air pollution and environmental damage is mitigated. EMA has an oversight role that seeks to ensure environmental protection as well as coming up with mitigation strategies on air pollution from the coal mining,"" says Mpofu-Zuze.

Towards a 12-billion-dollar mining economy: What are the gains?

After taking power in 2018, President Mnangagwa's administration put in place economic development strategies under the National Development Strategy 1 which projected a US$12-billion-dollar mining economy by the year 2023 that will make the country self-reliant in power generation and a net exporter of power regionally.

While the communities lie in desolation, the Government of Zimbabwe is focused on expanding coal production from three million tonnes to 15 million tonnes annually, and the new power projects mainly in Hwange are being financed by China.

Zimbabwe, like other African countries, is in debt, despite its objectives to achieve long-term United Nations' Sustainable Development mandates governments to foster inclusive, long-term economic development that creates jobs by 2030.

Debt crisis

The African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (Afrodad) 2023 reports that many African countries are lagging on economic and infrastructure development due to financial constraints despite an endowment of vast and rich mineral resources.

Resource rich poor countries are utilising their mineral resources to solve their challenges, alleviate poverty and initiate development strategies by leveraging on resource endowments through resource-backed loans and collateralisation of mineral resources.

Resource finance loans are popular financing models by China. According to Afrodad, an economic policy think-tank that is anchored on influencing policy change on debt management in Africa, between 2003 and 2011 out of a US$132 billion provided by Chinese banks to African governments, an estimated 57% was from resource finances. Desperate African governments enter into mining concessions with Chinese Banks and private companies leasing their resources as collateral,

""Governments give away too much in their desperation for infrastructure development. Chinese banks often involve a condition or lead to procurement being carried out by Chinese companies even though this could be due to the preferential support the banks will be bringing which eliminates competition. Most of the loans lack transparency, accountability and competition,"" reads the Afrodad report.

Is Zimbabwe mortgaging the country through debt?

While Zimbabwe projects a US$12-billion-dollar mining economy, the road map is to the detriment of the local people in the coal rich mining district of Hwange. Without proper management, ordinary citizens bear the brunt to the mining concessions and deals that the government entered with Chinese mining companies.

""In a weak governance system such as Zimbabwe resource-backed loans become burdensome for borrowers. Chinese investment is bringing conflict rather than development. In place of development, communities have nothing to show. Livelihoods have deteriorated, biodiversity and the ecology has been disrupted. Investors are extracting resources leaving communities without sustainable development,"" Daka said.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,,-0.1764705882352942,448860920,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/newsday/uploads/2024/03/K03l4oLRuC32ZfoTBOJpqlHnBcDJCYDfVUz6NY58.jpg,

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.",sacbee.com,news,The Sacramento Bee,"South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Ira Winderman",-0.06666666666666665,448860856,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/evvpll/picture287024560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5b4cdca4-1b8c-42f0-8975-b70107cb67cc,

Brent futures for May delivery settled at $85.43, losing 35 cents. U.S. crude settled at $80.63 a barrel, falling 44 cents. Both benchmarks logged less a than 1% change on the week.

""Everyone is watching for what the weekend will bring with Gaza,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC, adding that successful peace talks would prompt Yemen's Houthi rebels to allow oil tankers to pass through the Red Sea.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Blinken met Arab foreign ministers and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Cairo as negotiators in Qatar center on a truce of about six weeks.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was set for a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's surprise interest rate cut on Thursday bolstered global risk sentiment.

A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies, dampening demand.

While a possible ceasefire meant crude might move more freely globally, a lower U.S. oil rig count and the potential for easing U.S. interest rates helped support prices.

""We are still keeping fresh highs on the table given broad-based expansion in risk appetite that accelerated following the mid-week Fed comments that proved less hawkish than anticipated,"" said Houston-based Jim Ritterbusch, of Ritterbusch and Associates.

U.S. equities, which tend to move in correlation with oil prices, hit record highs after the Federal Reserve ended its regular meeting with no change in U.S. rates on Wednesday.

The U.S. oil rig count fell by one to 509 this week, according to Baker Hughes data, indicating lower future supply. [RIG/U]

The conflict in Eastern Europe also kept oil prices from moving lower. Russia launched the largest missile and drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure of the war to date on Friday, hitting the country's largest dam and causing blackouts in several regions, Kyiv said.

However, chatter has emerged within the market that Russia would further discount its barrels in light of the escalation, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

Nepal's Arun River indirectly feeds into the Ganges River system, ultimately replenishing Bangladesh's Padma River via interconnected waterways.

As per the requirement of the World Bank, which is partly funding the $1.9 billion Upper Arun Hydroelectric plant project, Nepal on 28 December sought Bangladesh's ""no objection"" to the construction of this power plant on the river.

According to documents seen by TBS, the Ministry for Water Resources and the Joint Rivers Commission of Bangladesh have so far issued their no objection to this project, saying as a run-of-river hydropower plant, it will not disrupt the flow of water in the Ganges and Padma rivers.

The Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are yet to provide their perspectives on the proposed project.

Construction of the plant 200 kilometres east of Kathmandu is scheduled to begin in November, with the project anticipated to be completed by 2034.

Bangladesh is currently in talks to establish the power tariff for its inaugural import of 40MW of hydropower from Nepal through India. Nepal has suggested a tariff of $0.07 per kilowatt hour (or unit), whereas Bangladesh is striving to secure a tariff of $0.05.

The agreement for this 40MW power import is expected to be completed before 15 June. This tariff underscores the cost-effectiveness of Nepal's hydropower compared to coal or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) based power, which currently costs Bangladesh between Tk 14-15 per unit.

In December, Bangladesh conveyed its interest to Nepal regarding the purchase of 500MW of hydropower.

Nepal's hydropower prospect

Relying on hydropower plants to produce more than 90% of its total electricity, Nepal heavily depends on hydro resources to fulfil its energy requirements. Given the vast scale of its potential, hydropower holds significant importance for Nepal's economic future, according to the US Agency for International Development.

Nepal intends to increase its hydropower generation capacity, taking advantage of its expanding power market access in India and Bangladesh.

Electricity production in Nepal reached 10,536 GWh in July 2023, compared with 9,521 GWh in the previous year. Electricity production data of Nepal is updated yearly averaging at 1,243 GWh from Jul 1975 to Jul 2023.

According to the Word Bank document, the proposed run-of-river Upper Arun Hydroelectric plant project has an optimum design capacity of about 1,040MW. It will provide firm energy for domestic customers during the dry season and will allow for exports of clean electricity to India and Bangladesh during the monsoon season.

Nepal is currently selling 13,000MW of electricity to India daily. India has been allowing Nepal to sell its power in its day-ahead market since November 2021.

According to the World Bank, ""Aside from meeting Nepal's energy needs, the Upper Arun Hydro-electric project will enable the displacement of more expensive, and carbon-intensive thermal generation in India and Bangladesh and support integration of variable renewable energy sources (such as solar) in the region"".

The proposed Project is Phase 1 of a series of projects in support of the Sub-South Asia Power Pool, which would include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka to increase the trade of electricity. Future phases may include strengthening transmission interconnections between these countries, and support to Bhutan in developing its hydropower.

According to World Bank documents, the proposed Project stands as the second hydro-electric project (HPP) within a series of five HPPs planned along the Arun River. Commencing from the most upstream project, the Kimathanka HPP (currently in the planning stage) situated at the China-Nepal border, the series includes the Arun 3 HPP (currently under construction). Downstream of the proposed project lie the Arun 4 and Lower Arun HPPs, also in the planning stage.

Power Secretary Md Habibur Rahman said new transmission lines will be necessary to facilitate the import of power from Nepal, including electricity generated by the proposed hydroelectric plant. This endeavour will entail a tripartite agreement, which the Power Division is actively pursuing.

What the WB says about the proposed plant

The Arun River serves as a tributary to the Sapta Koshi River. Subsequently, the Sapta Koshi River in Nepal continues into India, becoming the Koshi River, which eventually merges with the Ganges in India before flowing through Bangladesh as the Padma River.

According to World Bank documents, the proposed power plant adopts a run-of-river design, meaning it will not extract water from the Arun River. Instead, during the dry season (November to May), the reservoir will be filled by temporarily halting the river flow for 18 hours at specific intervals of the day to generate hydroelectricity through controlled release.

In the letter sent to Bangladesh authorities, the World Bank said the proposed project would not result in any substantial alteration to the water flow in the Koshi River, a tributary of the Ganges.

Seeking Bangladesh's consent to the project, the World Bank said due to the significant distance between the proposed project site and Farakka Point in India, it is improbable that short-term variations in the water flow of the Arun River would redirect the flow of the Ganges at Farakka. Moreover, the control of the Ganges flow in Bangladesh is managed by the Farakka Barrage. As a result, the hydropower plant's impact downstream of the Farakka Barrage is anticipated to be minimal.

According to Economic Relations Department (ERD) sources, under the World Bank's Operational Policy for Projects on International Waterways, the global lender is required to inform other countries sharing the waterway if it undertakes any project. In the event of objections raised by a riparian country, the World Bank may appoint independent experts according to its procedures. Following a thorough examination of the expert's report, the World Bank retains the option to withdraw from the project or proceed with financing despite objections.

Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, wrote to the Secretary of the Economic Relations Division on 20 December last year seeking Bangladesh's opinion on the proposed project.

In the letter, he said the proposed project will be located on the Arun River - a tributary to the Koshi River system, which is considered an international waterway. The World Bank's Operational Policy regarding projects on international waterways requires that the beneficiary country notifies other riparian countries of the project.

Faris Hadad-Zervos also said given the run-of-river nature of the proposed Project, the planned small reservoir size, and its location upstream of the under-construction Arun III hydroelectric project with significantly larger storage capacity than the proposed project, it is the considered view of the World Bank that the proposed investments would not have any appreciable impact on the quality and quantity of water flows of the Koshi River to other riparian countries.",tbsnews.net,news,The Business Standard,,0.0980392156862746,448860695,1,https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2022/06/16/nepals_hydropower_project.jpg,

MIAMI (AP) -- CJ McCollum scored 30 points, Jose Alvarado added 17 and the New Orleans Pelicans had no trouble in a 111-88 win over the Miami Heat on Friday night.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

However, there has been a notable increase of 94.21% in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. As these power plants are designed based on imported coal only, the growth can be attributed to a substantial decline in import prices of coal during the period. India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54% and 38% respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year, the ministry said.

Further, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278% in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82% during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24.

CJ McCollum scored 30 points, Jose Alvarado added 17 and the Pelicans had no trouble in a 111-88 win over Miami on Friday night -- the first meeting between the teams since four players got ejected when the teams played in New Orleans last month, a night capped by Jimmy Butler saying the Heat would win the rematch, too.

""It backfired on them today,"" Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado said.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

""They were packing the paint and staying in the zone,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And I would have, too.""

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans posted on social media postgame.

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

The Executive Vice President, Gas, Power and New Energy, Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPCL), Olalekan Ogunleye, has underscored the importance of gas as a crucial resource for driving economic development across Africa.

Ogunleye made this known while speaking during a panel session hosted by the NNPC Ltd at the ongoing 2024 CERAWeek Conference in Houston, the United States, with the theme, ""Africa's Energy Future: Access, Investment & Sustainability"".

He stated that gas would continue to be an important resource for Africa because it is the surest tool for economic development and for delivering better living standards for the teeming population on the continent.

He called on all gas players to sustain the advocacy for gas as a major energy source that will be utilised to develop the economic and industrial fortunes of the continent and a top priority for NNPC Ltd because the company is at the forefront of Nigeria's gas commercialisation efforts and flare elimination.

""Gas has come to stay. It is going to be part of the energy mix for us in the long term. We shall continue to be at the forefront of accelerating gas development and commercialization in Nigeria,"" he added.

He further identified transparency, accountability, research, technology and innovation as key drivers of the ongoing transformation in NNPCL.

Ogunleye disclosed that under the current leadership of Mele Kyari, the company has institutionalised the use of modern technology to drive its operations, a development that has created tremendous value for the company in its quest to compete with its global peers.

He said with the coming of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, NNPC Ltd has today transformed into an integrated commercial entity that is focused on transparency and accountability, two core values that are vital towards the company's quest to float an Initial Public Offer (IPO) at the stock exchange.

""Over the last five years, the NNPC Ltd has been pushing the agenda of transparency, accountability and performance excellence. I am glad to say that we are setting very high standards and this is a journey that we are all committed to going forward,"" Ogunleye added.

He further observed that transparency and accountability have a commercial component to them, because they can make any organisation attractive to its partners and potential investors.

He said currently, the NNPC Ltd is working assiduously to become IPO-ready, stressing that once that is done, the IPO will be phenomenal and successful.

Ogunleye, who described the future as exciting for the NNPC Ltd, said as the biggest energy company in Africa with the biggest resources and largest market, the company remains committed to delivering value to its shareholders by relentlessly improving its processes in line with global best standards.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.3490196078431373,448860057,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mr.-Olalekan-Ogunleye-Executive-Vice-President-Gas-Power-New-Energy-NNPC-Ltd-640x360.jpg,eng-9415440

They're fighting oil drilling","LOS ANGELES -- As the oil industry wages a multimillion-dollar campaign to repeal California drilling restrictions, the campaign to defend the state's environmental protections is starting to resemble a Hollywood blockbuster.

In a showcase of political clout and celebrity influence, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and actor Jane Fonda joined Gov. Gavin Newsom and environmental advocates Friday in Los Angeles to call on voters to rescue Senate Bill 1137, a state law that intends to ban new oil and gas drilling within 3,200 feet of homes, schools and parks next year.

Although Newsom signed the measure into law in 2022, California's oil industry spent around $20 million to collect enough signatures to put the law on the November ballot.

However, the fossil fuel interest groups have been challenged by a well-funded political committee whose biggest sponsors include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia and a coalition of environmental groups.

As a part of their counteroffensive, they enlisted Schwarzenegger and Fonda, two longtime opponents of oil drilling, for a news conference at a Ladera Heights soccer field that neighbors the Inglewood Oil Field -- the nation's largest urban drill site.

""They're spending millions and millions of dollars because they want to tell the California people that it is safe to drill next to a house,"" Schwarzenegger said as pumpjacks slowly bobbed behind him.

""They're coming back with the same trick and the same dialog. There will be no difference. They will be terminated again,"" he continued, referencing his famed ""Terminator"" movie franchise.

The oil industry has argued that less domestic oil production will result in more imported petroleum and higher emissions from shipping.

""Senate Bill 1137 doesn't just prevent new wells. It shuts down existing wells since maintenance is not allowed,"" said Rock Zierman, CEO of the California Independent Petroleum Assn. ""That means we will import more from the Saudi royal family instead of using local energy produced by California workers.""

The oil drilling referendum has evolved into one of the most expensive ballot measures of the 2024 general election so far, according to state election data. And the consequences, environmental advocates say, are far-reaching.

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

For the game, New Orleans shot 51.2 percent, including 18-of-36 on 3-pointers.

Miami shot 36 percent, including 13-of-47 on 3-pointers (27.7 percent).",centredaily.com,news,Centre Daily Times,Field Level Media,0.1529411764705881,448859350,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ravwr5/picture287024480/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/de981453-e91c-4552-bfea-b33958df0108,

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.",centredaily.com,news,Centre Daily Times,"South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Ira Winderman",-0.06666666666666665,448859350,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/evvpll/picture287024560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5b4cdca4-1b8c-42f0-8975-b70107cb67cc,

About 80% of India's merchandise trade with Europe - including key products such as crude oil, auto parts, chemicals, textiles - passes through the Red Sea route, where missile and drone attacks by Yemen's Houthi militants have forced many shipping firms to re-route vessels away from the Suez Canal to around the southern tip of Africa.

A combination of high freight costs, insurance premiums and long transit times can make imported goods ""significantly more expensive"", India's finance ministry said in its monthly economic review.

India's shipments of agricultural commodities, textiles, chemicals, capital goods, marine and petroleum products may be impacted due to the disruptions, and affect the price competitiveness of exports.

""To effectively address these challenges, there may be a need to diversify trade routes and transportation options,"" the finance ministry said.

Whether the crisis impacts the value of exports in the next financial year remains to be seen, the government said. India's financial year runs from April to March.

Despite the headwinds to India's strong growth and stable inflation regime, the ministry is confident the economy will close the current financial year on a positive note.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.",heraldonline.com,news,The Herald,"South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Ira Winderman",-0.06666666666666665,448859093,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/evvpll/picture287024560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5b4cdca4-1b8c-42f0-8975-b70107cb67cc,

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control.

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

In the hip-hop world, drama is often around the corner. Furthermore, it's waiting to bubble over at the slightest provocation. This is the case with Akbar V, whose recent remarks about Nicki Minaj's ""Big Foot"" diss track. Her comments have sparked controversy and speculation about her relationship with Megan Thee Stallion. In a statement addressing the situation, Akbar V made it clear that her support for ""Big Foot"" does not equate to animosity towards Megan Thee Stallion. Denying any personal issues with the Houston rapper, Akbar emphasized that her involvement in hyping up ""Big Foot"" was simply a matter of entertaining her audience and responding to fan requests.

Furthermore, the issue of matter lies in Akbar V's recent remarks recorded at a club appearance, where she exclaimed, ""This big foot b--ch trynna come for the f--kin queen of rap."" While the statement may have raised eyebrows, Akbar V insists that it was all in the spirit of rap entertainment. Moreover, she calls it a playful jab rather than a declaration of war. However, Megan Thee Stallion's hairstylist and friend took a shot and commented under the post trying to defend Megan. """"Akbar feet def doing sign language ... relax girl,"" he stated. Akbar V sought to clarify any misconceptions. Moreover, she stated in response to the friend and social media, ""You making this something bigger than what it really is. I don't have no problem with Meg. This is rap entertainment, that's her and Nicki beef, but the song hard and it was requested. I was at my paid hosting. It was funny. If you know me, I talk smack 'bout myself and all, baby. I'm hood. We joan all day.""

Furthermore, social media wasn't too impressed with Akbar trying to defend herself. ""To hate a woman that doesn't know you is a different kind of weak,"" one person commented. ""As an upcoming 'artist' if I'm in the club with a mic the last thing I would be doing is yelling somebody else's lyrics to the top of my lungs,"" one person commented. ""I'd be tryna push my own music but maybe that's just me."" ""Here she goes...throwing rocks and hiding her hand! Smh,"" another person said.

Ultimately, whether it's hyping up a diss track or setting the record straight, Akbar V claims it was all in the name of entertainment. And while controversies may come and go, one thing remains clear. In the world of rap, anything can happen, and the drama never truly sleeps.

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.",kansas.com,news,The Wichita Eagle,"South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Ira Winderman",-0.06666666666666665,448858810,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/evvpll/picture287024560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5b4cdca4-1b8c-42f0-8975-b70107cb67cc,

Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.",sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports,Tim Reynolds,0.1058823529411765,448858765,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9419358

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

The singer-guitarist reports that he suffered a heat stroke, which caused him to nearly collapse and vomit. Despite this, DeLonge managed to recover and finish the show.

Along with a photo of himself from the concert, DeLonge posted on Instagram, ""This was about 1 min before heat stroke hit. Fell to my knees, everything went blurry, then wobbled to the side of the stage and vomited for a bit. Super fun. @markhoppus and @travisbarker made up for the lost time... man, this was not something I've ever felt before. 95 Degrees at a 11pm on stage. But... I made it back and finished the show. Cause that's what Navy Seals do... @blink182.""

Video footage (as seen below) shows DeLonge performing the song ""More Than You Know"" while standing against Travis Barker's drum riser. A few seconds later he appears on his knees as he continues playing.

After the song ends, singer-bassist Mark Hoppus looks offstage and says, ""You alright, Tommy? Tom's throwing up right now, I think. I think Tom's throwing up.""

Hoppus and Barker then proceed to kill time with a few bass and drum solos, along with some comedic banter. After about five minutes, DeLonge returns to the stage to perform ""Happy Holidays, You Bastard"" and continues the rest of the show.

WATCH l Gilles, Poirier base their free dance on 'Wuthering Heights':

The sexual assault allegations against Canadian-Danish ice dancer Nikolaj Sorensen overshadowed the rhythm dance competition Friday at the world figure skating championships.

In January, USA Today reported an American figure skating coach and former skater accused Sorensen of sexually assaulting her in Hartford, Conn., in 2012. Sorensen has denied the allegations, which have not been proven in court.

USA Today further reported Thursday that the attorney for Sorensen's complainant, Nancy Hogshead, said comments made by the ice dancer on March 6 in Montreal amount to ""retaliation"" against the complainant and should have been grounds for his suspension from the world championships.

""When something like that comes out in the media, the damage is kind of done and I think that was the intention more than anything,"" Sorensen said about the allegations at the time.

WATCH l Stellato-Dudek hopes historic comeback win inspires others:

The USA Today article also cites the complainant, who said via text message she'd hoped the case would remain confidential.

Sorensen said on Friday he was ""not aware at all"" of the recent comments from the complainant and her lawyer.

The case is now in the hands of Canada's Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner, which opened in 2022 to be an independent handler of abuse reports and complaints in federally-funded sports organizations.

Skate Canada chief executive officer Debra Armstrong said on March 6 the federation did not consider leaving Sorensen off the Canadian team because he and Fournier Beaudry qualified through the selection criteria.

Earlier Friday, ISU president Jae Youl Kim said ""we respect the presumed innocence and the decision Skate Canada has made to enter Mr. Sorensen.""",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,0.2627450980392156,448858637,1,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7153405.1711161100!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fig-worlds-20240322.JPG,eng-9419219

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

For the game, New Orleans shot 51.2 percent, including 18-of-36 on 3-pointers.

Miami shot 36 percent, including 13-of-47 on 3-pointers (27.7 percent).",fresnobee.com,news,The Fresno Bee,Field Level Media,0.1529411764705881,448858630,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ravwr5/picture287024480/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/de981453-e91c-4552-bfea-b33958df0108,

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

For the game, New Orleans shot 51.2 percent, including 18-of-36 on 3-pointers.

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

- 4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

- 5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

MIAMI - If you didn't know better, you would think the Miami Heat are bent on attempting to recreate last season's playoff path that started in the play-in round.

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

The Pelicans, who lost on Thursday night in Orlando while the Heat were idle, got 30 points from CJ McCollum, who shot 6 of 12 on 3-pointers, part of the Pelicans' 18 of 36 from beyond the arc.

The Heat again played in the injury absences of Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson, with those absences telling in the loss that dropped the Heat to 17-16 home, with the Cleveland Cavaliers up next on Sunday.

Five Degrees of Heat from Friday night's game:

- 1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

- 2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

- 3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

A skirmish broke out after a no-call on a Zion Williamson take to the rim. Multiple players were suspended on each side.

Before Friday's rematch in Miami, Pelicans coach Willie Green implored his team to keep their composure. The Pelicans fell behind 14-2 early in the first quarter, but they steadied themselves and earned a 111-88 win over the Heat at Kaseya Center.

Brandon Ingram, who planted awkwardly on his left knee in Thursday's game, did not play. The Pelicans said Ingram is dealing with a left knee bone contusion and will be reevaluated in two weeks.

Despite one of their All-Stars being injured and their other All-Star -- Zion Williamson -- scoring four points, the Pelicans still won convincingly. CJ McCollum took on more of the scoring load. The veteran guard rained down six 3-pointers on the Heat.

McCollum finished with 30 points. The Pelicans improved to 21-2 this season when McCollum scores 20 or more.

New Orleans won in Miami for the first time since Dec. 23, 2017. The Pelicans had lost their last five games against the Heat in Florida before they broke that streak Friday.

Without Ingram, the Pelicans inserted Murphy into the starting lineup. Murphy looked wobbly at first. He committed three turnovers in the first quarter.

But Murphy made some critical long-range shots, which turned the game's momentum in New Orleans' favor. Murphy hit three 3-pointers in the first quarter. His pull-up shot from 26 feet away with less than one minute remaining in the first quarter got New Orleans within one point. The Pelicans exited the first quarter with a one-point lead even though they committed six turnovers.

Williamson did not score until the 11:23 mark of the third quarter. It was one of two baskets he made all game.

The Pelicans pounded the Heat on the glass and in bench scoring. New Orleans out-rebounded Miami 61-39. Reserves Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall combined to score 30 points.

With 10:34 remaining in the fourth quarter, Marshall streaked ahead in transition. He caught the ball and flushed a left-handed dunk, which increased the Pelicans' lead to 16 points. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra burned a timeout.

Heat star forward Jimmy Butler scored 17 points on 5-of-12 shooting. Herb Jones, who was the primary defender on Butler, blocked one of Butler's midrange jumper attempts in the third quarter. Jones, an All-Defense candidate, made Butler work for all of his points.

The Heat shot 13 of 47 from 3. Butler did not attempt a shot from behind the arc.

The Pelicans (43-27) have exceeded their win total from last season with 12 games remaining. They next play Sunday against the Detroit Pistons.",theadvocate.com,news,The Advocate,Christian Clark,0.03529411764705892,448857638,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/bd/6bd0bcc1-e473-5d75-8e4e-7c000e08c441/65fe3ee60c6eb.image.jpg?crop=1703%2C894%2C0%2C161&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9419358

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

The Miami Heat start the current four-game home stand inside the Kaseya Center with a frustrating loss against the New Orleans Pelicans, 111-88. A loss like this hurts the Heat as with now 13 games left in the regular season, time is running out to solidify position for the postseason as the Eastern Conference is tightly packed.

While the Pelicans are far from a bad team, it is still befuddling to see how stale Miami came out to perform in the game as they were abysmal from the field and especially from three-point range shooting 36 percent and 27.7 percent respectively. Jimmy Butler led with 17 points to go along with five assists and four rebounds.

While the Pelicans were successful for most of this game, one of thew few aspects Miami did well was defend arguably their best and most explosive player in Zion Williamson. So much so, that they kept him scoreless through the first half which is the first time for Williamson in his NBA career.

They did an exceptional job in pressuring him on drive-ins to the rim and clogging up the lanes where Williamson gets most of his success. They would also force him to commit four turnovers in the first half out of New Orleans' 11 where the Heat got 16 points out of those mistakes.

Williamson finished with four points and if any fan sees that with no context, the first thought would probably be that the opposing team won with ease. Not this time as even with Williamson struggling and Brandon Ingram out with injury, it was guard CJ McCollum who was excellent with 30 points along with Jose Alvarado who scored 17 off the bench.

Three-point shooting struggles for Miami without Duncan Robinson

The absence of Duncan Robinson was felt throughout the game, especially in the first half as Miami only made two shots from deep out of 15 attempts until Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra brought in Cole Swider. Despite rarely hearing his name called, he came into the game and hit two straight threes.

Besides the bit of juice, the Heat were struggling from beyond the arch despite the Pelicans giving them multiple opportunities to capitalize. Including Friday, Robinson has missed the last two games due to a back injury that was later specified as ""right facet syndrome"" and a timetable on his return is unknown except for Spoelstra saying before the game that he is ""day-to-day.""

While it's hard to put the full reason for the loss on one player that is arguably not a top three player on the team, shooting from deep has been a strength for Miami in the past because of Robinson. If everything else isn't working including the threat from deep, it's a recipe for disaster which this game showed as they finished making 13 of 37 attempts from deep.

Momentum towards rest of the home stand

As it was written about earlier by ClutchPoints, the home record for the Heat has been middling at best when in previous years, it was a massive strength. The current four-game home stand was a chance to rack up some victories against opponents like the Pelicans who they beat in late February, despite them winning seven of their last 10 games before Friday.

They now drop to 17-16 on their home floor which if you told a Heat fan that would happen before the season, they would think you're in Bizarro world. But, this is reality and Miami has to now face it as the regular season is coming closer and closer to being over.

While it would have been beneficial to have positive momentum going into Sunday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, they now have to climb more hurdles. As per the Heat way, they now enter the dire home stretch of the season on an edge-of-your-seat time where there is now no room for error as they should be playing playoff basketball a bit early.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Zachary Weinberger,-0.1450980392156863,448857457,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Heat_takeaways_from_winloss_vs._Pelicans.jpg,eng-9419358

New Orleans (43-27) improved to 23-14 on the road. Miami (38-32) dropped to 17-16 at home.

The Pelicans won for the eighth time in 10 games, and they did it despite a quiet game from Zion Williamson and the injury absence of Brandon Ingram (left knee). They are the Pelicans' top two scorers.

Williamson was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting. That snapped his streak of seven straight games scoring at least 20 points. He averaged 27.3 points during that stretch.

It was New Orleans' first win in Miami since December 2017. The Heat had beaten the Pelicans seven straight times overall.

Miami, just 3-6 in its past nine games, was led by Jimmy Butler (17 points). Heat center Bam Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat's frustration was exemplified in the second quarter when they failed to score on a four-on-two fastbreak. On the other end, McCollum banked in a 3-pointer.

Miami was without Duncan Robinson (back), Tyler Herro (foot), Kevin Love (heel) and Josh Richardson (shoulder) did not play.

Miami led for the entire first quarter until New Orleans closed the period on a 14-2 run, taking a 21-20 lead. The Heat shot just 2-for-15 from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Pelicans made 4-of-7 from deep.

McCollum, after a scoreless first quarter (0-for-3 shooting), caught fire with 12 points in the second period on 5-for-7 shooting, including 2-of-4 from deep.

McCollum's performance helped New Orleans extend its lead to 46-42 at halftime. Miami shot just 32.6 percent in the first half, including 5-of-26 on 3-pointers (19.2 percent).

New Orleans made 8-of-17 on 3-pointers (47.1 percent), but the Heat stayed in the game with a 16-2 edge in points off turnovers.

Early in the third quarter, the Pelicans put together an 11-0 run, and they pushed their lead to 14 points. By the end of the period, New Orleans led 76-66.

The Pelicans were never threatened in the fourth quarter.

For the game, New Orleans shot 51.2 percent, including 18-of-36 on 3-pointers.

A 19-year-old woman was speeding early Saturday in a Porsche when she lost control of the vehicle and barreled through a Shell gas station and into another parking lot, the Ann Arbor Police Department (AAPD) said on Facebook. Officials estimated the car was traveling about 100 mph.

Another 19-year-old woman was inside the car and suffered minor injuries alongside the driver. Both women were transported to a local hospital, police said.

A 20-year-old male passenger suffered significant injuries from the crash and was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Police said Friday the man is still hospitalized but expected to survive. (RELATED: Video Shows Ambulance Narrowly Avoid A Car Flipping Over On The Highway).

""We were thinking they had to be going over 100 miles per hour. [They] hit that curb, they ran through our whole lot, and they flipped and somersaulted and landed into the plaza next door,"" Omar Hasan, the manager of the Shell gas station, told Fox 2 News.

Multiple cars in the parking lot were damaged after the incident. During the crash, a tire flew off the vehicle and collided with the windshield of a car parked in the gas station parking lot, the outlet reported.

Hasan told Fox he had been asking his brother to move one of the cars and was glad he didn't get around to moving it, as it was damaged by the crash.

""Thankfully he didn't because there was oncoming traffic that morning. While they were somersaulting, the tire flew out and it just smashed - it totaled that car. Just thinking about it, if that car wasn't there, it would've hit oncoming traffic and probably could've killed someone,"" Hasan added.

""The video of the crash very clearly shows the dangers of driving impaired and at excessive speeds,"" the AAPD said on Facebook. ""It also shows the importance of wearing your seatbelt. Seatbelts save lives and that was a very big reason all three occupants were able to survive this violent crash.""

Police suspect alcohol was a factor in the crash.

""It's very unfortunate that these are 19-year-old kids driving a super car (and) they're drunk,"" Hasan told the outlet. ""The questions arise in the community: Where did they get drunk at?

A skirmish broke out after a no-call on a Zion Williamson take to the rim. Multiple players were suspended on each side.

Before Friday's rematch in Miami, Pelicans coach Willie Green implored his team to keep their composure. The Pelicans fell behind 14-2 early in the first quarter, but they steadied themselves and earned a 111-88 win over the Heat at Kaseya Center.

Brandon Ingram, who planted awkwardly on his left knee in Thursday's game, did not play. The Pelicans said Ingram is dealing with a left knee bone contusion and will be reevaluated in two weeks.

Despite one of their All-Stars being injured and their other All-Star -- Zion Williamson -- scoring four points, the Pelicans still won convincingly. CJ McCollum took on more of the scoring load. The veteran guard rained down six 3-pointers on the Heat.

McCollum finished with 30 points. The Pelicans improved to 21-2 this season when McCollum scores 20 or more.

New Orleans won in Miami for the first time since Dec. 23, 2017. The Pelicans had lost their last five games against the Heat in Florida before they broke that streak Friday.

Without Ingram, the Pelicans inserted Murphy into the starting lineup. Murphy looked wobbly at first. He committed three turnovers in the first quarter.

But Murphy made some critical long-range shots, which turned the game's momentum in New Orleans' favor. Murphy hit three 3-pointers in the first quarter. His pull-up shot from 26 feet away with less than one minute remaining in the first quarter got New Orleans within one point. The Pelicans exited the first quarter with a one-point lead even though they committed six turnovers.

Williamson did not score until the 11:23 mark of the third quarter. It was one of two baskets he made all game.

The Pelicans pounded the Heat on the glass and in bench scoring. New Orleans out-rebounded Miami 61-39. Reserves Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall combined to score 30 points.

With 10:34 remaining in the fourth quarter, Marshall streaked ahead in transition. He caught the ball and flushed a left-handed dunk, which increased the Pelicans' lead to 16 points. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra burned a timeout.

Heat star forward Jimmy Butler scored 17 points on 5-of-12 shooting. Herb Jones, who was the primary defender on Butler, blocked one of Butler's midrange jumper attempts in the third quarter. Jones, an All-Defense candidate, made Butler work for all of his points.

The Heat shot 13 of 47 from 3. Butler did not attempt a shot from behind the arc.

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

""We just have not been good enough. We all know that. We're aware of it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

It was the first meeting between the teams since Feb. 23, when the teams scuffled and four players -- Butler and Thomas Bryant for the Heat; Alvarado and Marshall for the Pelicans -- were ejected from what became a 106-95 Miami win. Afterward, Butler said, ""We'll beat them the next time, too.""

The Pelicans evidently remembered. Green predicted pregame that his team would feel some added emotions given what happened a month ago against the Heat.

""For us, it's simple,"" Green said. ""Go out, execute the game plan, play our style, play up to our standards.""

Butler opened the second half with a three-point play that got Miami within one, and the Pelicans immediately responded with an 11-0 run to keep control. New Orleans was down 18-7 early and then settled into a groove, trailing only once in the final 36 minutes -- and that was a mere 22-second stint early in the second quarter.

Takeaways from another home loss","Five takeaways from the Heat's 111-88 loss against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night at Kaseya Center:

▪ The Heat sprinted to an early 17-7 lead. Everything went downhill from there, due to wretched three-point shooting. New Orleans broke a seven-game losing streak against Miami and won in South Florida for the first time since 2017.

The Pelicans frazzled the Heat with zone defense and quick close outs, and Miami kept shooting blanks, closing at 27.7 percent on threes (13 for 47) and a season-worst 36 percent overall from the field.

At one point, the Heat was 2 for 20 on threes, and 0 for 17 if you counted everyone on the team except Nikola Jovic.

Meanwhile, the Pelicans -- playing without injured 21-point-per-game scorer Brandon Ingram -- shot 50 percent on threes (18 for 36) and were quick and alert defensively.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans organization tweeted afterward.

After the Heat took that early 10-point lead, New Orleans erupted on a 28-7 run and led 46-42 at the half. Miami went to the break shooting 5 for 26 on threes and very much missing injured Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro and fellow floor spacer Kevin Love.

From there, the Pelicans began the third on an 18-5 run, led 76-66 after three and stretched the margin to 20 early in the fourth quarter.

Jimmy Butler did what he could against the Pelicans' zone and quick close outs and the long arms of Herb Jones, finishing with 17 points and five assists on 5 for 12 shooting.

But there wasn't nearly enough support.

Caleb Martin shot 0 for 6 on threes in the first half and finished 0 for 8 from the field.

Patty Mills opened 0 for 4 on threes and is now 3 for his last 31 on threes.

Jaime Jaquez Jr. shot 1 for 7.

It didn't help that Bam Adebayo didn't even take a shot in the third quarter and went to the fourth with just six points on 2 for 5 shooting, before closing with 12 points and 10 rebounds.

Terry Rozier scored just 13 on a night more was needed.

New Orleans outrebounded the Heat, 56-34.

In one sequence, the Heat messed up a 4-on-1 break on one end, and CJ McCollum -- who scored 30 -- then banked in a three-pointer on the other end.

Miami (38-32) entered as the league's fourth lowest scoring team and mustered just 20, 22, 24 and 22 points in each quarter.

▪ The Heat used its 34th different starting lineup, extending its franchise record. But there wasn't nearly enough from the backcourt or Adebayo.

The latest starting quintet - Butler, Adebayo, Nikola Jovic, Mills and Rozier - sprinted to a 17-7 lead. The bench couldn't hold it; the Pelicans ended the quarter on a 14-2 run to lead 21-20 after one.

The starting group began the third quarter poorly; after a Butler three-point play to begin the second half, New Orleans unleashed an 11-0 run capped by a Zion Williamson dunk. The run stretched to 18-5 before Spoelstra made substitutions.

Jovic did his part early, scoring 10 in the first half, but struggled to start the third quarter.

Butler didn't hit a shot from the field until driving for a basket with 5:12 left in the second quarter, on his third attempt of the game. He eventually got untracked a bit, but Herb Jones and others - coupled with the Pelicans' zone - made it difficult for him all night.

Mills again struggled as a starter, scoring four and finishing 2 for 7 from the field in 12 minutes.

Rozier went 5 for 14 on a night the Heat needed the high-scoring Charlotte version of Rozier.

Desperate for shooting, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider for the 12th time this season, and he hit four of his six three-pointers, finishing with 14 points in 18 minutes.

After losing Thursday in Orlando, the Pelicans won easily despite Ingram's absence and despite a quiet night from Williamson, who scored just four points in 25 minutes.

▪ There was no repeat of the altercation or ""extracurricular activities"" that marred the last Heat-Pelicans game - a Feb. 23 Miami win in New Orleans. But the Pelicans suspended after that game got some measure of retribution.

Spoelstra predictably downplayed the matter before the game.

""It's all behind us,"" he said. ""This was nothing compared to the 90s.""

That ugly incident last month began when Pelicans forward Zion Williamson fell to the court after a foul by Kevin Love, who remained out with an injury Friday.

Butler and Pelicans forward Naji Marshall then got into a shoving match and briefly grabbed each other by the neck. Heat center Thomas Bryant and Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado began fighting.

Bryant, Butler, Marshall and Alvarado all were ejected for the Pelicans. It also led to suspensions for three Heat players (Nikola Jovic, Thomas Bryant and Butler) and two Pelicans players (Marshall and Alvarado).

Butler then guaranteed Miami would win the second matchup between the team.

""We'll beat them the next time, too,"" Butler said that night. ""We're just the better team. We're not going to say that they're not a good team. But I don't think this really matters. I think that when we get them on our home court, it's going to be a different game. I hope they're healthy and it's going to be the same outcome.""

He didn't back down from those comments earlier this week, but the guaranteed ultimately proved worthless.

And Marshall, after the game, retweeted Butler's guarantee of a win with the words: ""My Volume don't work what he say ?????""

As it turns out, all four players who served suspensions had some good moments Friday.

Alvarado played particularly well, with 17 points. Marshall had 13 points and 7 rebounds.

The Pelicans outscored the Heat by 28 with Alvarado on the court and by 26 with Marshall on the court.

Bryant led a short-lived Heat run late in the third with two three-pointers.

▪ The Heat must play better at home to go anywhere in postseason. Friday was another bad sign.

Miami entered just 17-15 at home, the 10th worst in the league and the worst among top seven seeds. Now it's 17-16, unacceptable for a team that considers itself a contender.

What's more, Miami began the night 1-8 against teams holding a top five seed in either conference. It's now 1-9 after beating the Pelicans, who are fifth in the West.

Reversing that is vital; nine of Miami's last 13 games are at home, beginning with Friday's game.

""We have not been good enough,"" Spoelstra said before the game of Miami's play at home. ""We all know that. We're aware of it. We can't go back and change the games we've lost here. We would love to show out better in front of our fans.""

The Heat has two more home losses than it had all of last season; its 17 home wins are fewest among top-nine seeds in each conference.

Conversely, Miami is 21-16 on the road and is tied with Cleveland for the second most road wins in the Eastern Conference.

▪ Robinson hopes to be back soon from a back injury.

Robinson missed his second game in a row with what has been diagnosed as left facet syndrome. But the scan on Robinson's back provided relief that it's nothing particularly serious.

""Definitely [getting] better, significantly better than Monday,"" he said Friday evening. ""It's improving a lot.""

He wouldn't rule playing Sunday against Cleveland but it sounds like his absence might be longer.

""Thankful it's not too serious,"" he said. ""Big thing is making sure [to] calm it down. It's flared up right now. I'm trying to play as soon as I possibly can. Itching to be back out there. As soon as get the clear and OK, I'll be back out there. Taking a couple days helps a lot. The recovery and treatment has helped as well as other things.

Asked about Sunday's game, he said: ""I wouldn't count out anything. I want to play as soon as I possibly can. I don't know when for sure that will be.""

Given the opportunity to begin a move out of the play-in bracket, where one or two losses can lead to elimination before the start of the NBA playoffs, the Heat on Friday night instead opened a critical four-game homestand with a 111-88 loss at Kaseya Center to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Against an opponent playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, an opponent that got only four points from Zion Williamson, the Heat struggled to craft any semblance of offense.

Part of that credit goes to a Pelicans defense bent on suffocating the Heat, who entered having won the previous seven matchups.

And perhaps part of it was Heat forward Jimmy Butler vowing another victory in the immediate wake of the Heat's brawl-marred victory a month ago in New Orleans.

On a night the Heat closed 13 of 47 (.277) on 3-pointers, the Heat got 17 points from Butler and 12 points and 10 rebounds from center Bam Adebayo.

1. Closing time: The Heat trailed 21-20 at the end of the opening period, 46-42 at halftime and 76-66 going into the fourth quarter.

The Heat then opened the fourth quarter with a lineup of Thomas Bryant, Caleb Martin, Cole Swider, Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Adebayo then returned, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had to call time with 10:34 remaining and his team down 16, reinserting Butler.

It didn't matter, with the Pelicans going up 20 with 7:35 to play.

2. Full-time focus: The Pelicans loaded up against Butler to the degree that his first official field-goal attempt did not come until 7:41 remained in the second period, when he was off on a desperation 3-point attempt to beat the shot clock (he had gotten to the line earlier on a missed first-quarter attempt).

Butler's first basket did not come until he converted a layup with 5:14 left in the second quarter.

Prior to Butler's first shot, Patty Mills and Martin each had seven attempts from the field, at a combined 2 of 14.

Herb Jones' defense on Butler was relentless throughout, forcing Butler to pass back out to the perimeter even with the Heat lacking shooting.

3. The three thing: With Robinson missing his second consecutive game with a back issue, the Heat got off to a 2-of-19 start on 3-pointers, with those conversions coming on an early pair of open corner attempts from Nikola Jovic.

That's when, with 8:04 left in the second period, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider. The forward on a two-way contract who had not previously played since the Feb. 26 victory over the Sacramento Kings, not in the mix in the 12 games prior to Friday.

Swider promptly converted a pair of 3-pointers.

The Heat stood at 5 of 26 on 3-pointers at halftime and at 9 of 37 (.243) going into the fourth.

4. Disarming Adebayo: The last time he played, Adebayo did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter of Monday night's 98-91 loss in Philadelphia, then sitting out Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland with a back contusion. This time he had only five attempts entering the fourth quarter.

The lack of attempts came even as the Pelicans played small, opening the second half with Larry Nance Jr. at center in place of starter Jonas Valanciunas.

Adebayo nonetheless extended his string of games with at least one 3-pointer to five, with a fourth-quarter conversion. In addition, Bryant, his backup, converted a pair of third-period 3-pointers.

5. Zion perspective: The Heat's first-half woes came even with the Pelicans' Williamson held scoreless in a first half for the first time in his career.

Williamson missed his four shots over the first two periods, not scoring until converting a dunk 37 seconds into the second half.

Even as the Pelicans pushed their lead to 14 in the third period, Williamson had only four points through the first three quarters, with no need for him to return in the fourth.",sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports,,-0.05098039215686279,448856807,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9420783

Takeaways from another home loss","Five takeaways from the Heat's 111-88 loss against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night at Kaseya Center:

▪ The Heat sprinted to an early 17-7 lead. Everything went downhill from there, due to wretched three-point shooting. New Orleans broke a seven-game losing streak against Miami and won in South Florida for the first time since 2017.

The Pelicans frazzled the Heat with zone defense and quick close outs, and Miami kept shooting blanks, closing at 27.7 percent on threes (13 for 47) and a season-worst 36 percent overall from the field.

At one point, the Heat was 2 for 20 on threes, and 0 for 17 if you counted everyone on the team except Nikola Jovic.

Meanwhile, the Pelicans -- playing without injured 21-point-per-game scorer Brandon Ingram -- shot 50 percent on threes (18 for 36) and were quick and alert defensively.

""We're just a better team,"" the Pelicans organization tweeted afterward.

After the Heat took that early 10-point lead, New Orleans erupted on a 28-7 run and led 46-42 at the half. Miami went to the break shooting 5 for 26 on threes and very much missing injured Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro and fellow floor spacer Kevin Love.

From there, the Pelicans began the third on an 18-5 run, led 76-66 after three and stretched the margin to 20 early in the fourth quarter.

Jimmy Butler did what he could against the Pelicans' zone and quick close outs and the long arms of Herb Jones, finishing with 17 points and five assists on 5 for 12 shooting.

But there wasn't nearly enough support.

Caleb Martin shot 0 for 6 on threes in the first half and finished 0 for 8 from the field.

Patty Mills opened 0 for 4 on threes and is now 3 for his last 31 on threes.

Jaime Jaquez Jr. shot 1 for 7.

It didn't help that Bam Adebayo didn't even take a shot in the third quarter and went to the fourth with just six points on 2 for 5 shooting, before closing with 12 points and 10 rebounds.

Terry Rozier scored just 13 on a night more was needed.

New Orleans outrebounded the Heat, 56-34.

In one sequence, the Heat messed up a 4-on-1 break on one end, and CJ McCollum -- who scored 30 -- then banked in a three-pointer on the other end.

Miami (38-32) entered as the league's fourth lowest scoring team and mustered just 20, 22, 24 and 22 points in each quarter.

▪ The Heat used its 34th different starting lineup, extending its franchise record. But there wasn't nearly enough from the backcourt or Adebayo.

The latest starting quintet - Butler, Adebayo, Nikola Jovic, Mills and Rozier - sprinted to a 17-7 lead. The bench couldn't hold it; the Pelicans ended the quarter on a 14-2 run to lead 21-20 after one.

The starting group began the third quarter poorly; after a Butler three-point play to begin the second half, New Orleans unleashed an 11-0 run capped by a Zion Williamson dunk. The run stretched to 18-5 before Spoelstra made substitutions.

Jovic did his part early, scoring 10 in the first half, but struggled to start the third quarter.

Butler didn't hit a shot from the field until driving for a basket with 5:12 left in the second quarter, on his third attempt of the game. He eventually got untracked a bit, but Herb Jones and others - coupled with the Pelicans' zone - made it difficult for him all night.

Mills again struggled as a starter, scoring four and finishing 2 for 7 from the field in 12 minutes.

Rozier went 5 for 14 on a night the Heat needed the high-scoring Charlotte version of Rozier.

Desperate for shooting, Spoelstra inserted Cole Swider for the 12th time this season, and he hit four of his six three-pointers, finishing with 14 points in 18 minutes.

After losing Thursday in Orlando, the Pelicans won easily despite Ingram's absence and despite a quiet night from Williamson, who scored just four points in 25 minutes.

▪ There was no repeat of the altercation or ""extracurricular activities"" that marred the last Heat-Pelicans game - a Feb. 23 Miami win in New Orleans. But the Pelicans suspended after that game got some measure of retribution.

Spoelstra predictably downplayed the matter before the game.

""It's all behind us,"" he said. ""This was nothing compared to the 90s.""

That ugly incident last month began when Pelicans forward Zion Williamson fell to the court after a foul by Kevin Love, who remained out with an injury Friday.

Butler and Pelicans forward Naji Marshall then got into a shoving match and briefly grabbed each other by the neck. Heat center Thomas Bryant and Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado began fighting.

Bryant, Butler, Marshall and Alvarado all were ejected for the Pelicans. It also led to suspensions for three Heat players (Nikola Jovic, Thomas Bryant and Butler) and two Pelicans players (Marshall and Alvarado).

Butler then guaranteed Miami would win the second matchup between the team.

""We'll beat them the next time, too,"" Butler said that night. ""We're just the better team. We're not going to say that they're not a good team. But I don't think this really matters. I think that when we get them on our home court, it's going to be a different game. I hope they're healthy and it's going to be the same outcome.""

He didn't back down from those comments earlier this week, but the guaranteed ultimately proved worthless.

And Marshall, after the game, retweeted Butler's guarantee of a win with the words: ""My Volume don't work what he say ?????""

As it turns out, all four players who served suspensions had some good moments Friday.

Alvarado played particularly well, with 17 points. Marshall had 13 points and 7 rebounds.

The Pelicans outscored the Heat by 28 with Alvarado on the court and by 26 with Marshall on the court.

Bryant led a short-lived Heat run late in the third with two three-pointers.

▪ The Heat must play better at home to go anywhere in postseason. Friday was another bad sign.

Miami entered just 17-15 at home, the 10th worst in the league and the worst among top seven seeds. Now it's 17-16, unacceptable for a team that considers itself a contender.

What's more, Miami began the night 1-8 against teams holding a top five seed in either conference. It's now 1-9 after beating the Pelicans, who are fifth in the West.

Reversing that is vital; nine of Miami's last 13 games are at home, beginning with Friday's game.

""We have not been good enough,"" Spoelstra said before the game of Miami's play at home. ""We all know that. We're aware of it. We can't go back and change the games we've lost here. We would love to show out better in front of our fans.""

The Heat has two more home losses than it had all of last season; its 17 home wins are fewest among top-nine seeds in each conference.

Conversely, Miami is 21-16 on the road and is tied with Cleveland for the second most road wins in the Eastern Conference.

▪ Robinson hopes to be back soon from a back injury.

Robinson missed his second game in a row with what has been diagnosed as left facet syndrome. But the scan on Robinson's back provided relief that it's nothing particularly serious.

""Definitely [getting] better, significantly better than Monday,"" he said Friday evening. ""It's improving a lot.""

He wouldn't rule playing Sunday against Cleveland but it sounds like his absence might be longer.

""Thankful it's not too serious,"" he said. ""Big thing is making sure [to] calm it down. It's flared up right now. I'm trying to play as soon as I possibly can. Itching to be back out there. As soon as get the clear and OK, I'll be back out there. Taking a couple days helps a lot. The recovery and treatment has helped as well as other things.

Asked about Sunday's game, he said: ""I wouldn't count out anything. I want to play as soon as I possibly can. I don't know when for sure that will be.""

Buthe quickly added: ""You want to be smart about it. I understand down the stretch there is going to be some managing of it from a pain perspective, which I'm ready to embrace, but you don't want to rush back to where it just flares up to where it starts [process] from day one.""

It was McCollum's fifth 30-point game of the season and his second in the last week. Trey Murphy III scored 14 points and Naji Marshall had 13 for New Orleans, which only got four points in 25 minutes from Zion Williamson and rolled anyway.

Jimmy Butler scored 17 points for the Heat, who fell four games behind Orlando in the Southeast Division race and missed a potential opportunity to climb out of play-in tournament range. Terry Rozier scored 13 and Bam Adebayo finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for Miami -- which was 13 for 47 from 3-point range.

The Pelicans were without Brandon Ingram, who will miss at least two weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee. He was hurt in Thursday's loss at Orlando, but the Pelicans say he'll be re-evaluated early next month -- which would mean before the end of the regular season.

""We're going to miss him, 20 points per game, he's leading our team in assists, so we're definitely going to miss him,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""But we're grateful that it wasn't more than what it was. ... We're going to miss him. The next guys just have to step up.""

Miami was again without Tyler Herro (foot), Duncan Robinson (back) and Kevin Love (heel). And when the Heat can't score, they can't win -- they're now 2-15 when they score 100 points or less, as compared to 36-17 when scoring at least 101.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 17 home games. A team that entered Friday with the ninth-best road record this season at 21-16 is now just 17-16 at home, the 19th-best mark in the league when the game ended.

- Considering the way the Heat shot 3-pointers in this one -- or more to the point did not -- the biggest news of the night came arguably before the game, with Heat guard Duncan Robinson expressing optimism about a rapid return, even as he missed his second game with a back issue diagnosed as left facet syndrome.

- ""Thankful that it's not too serious,"" Robinson said pregame. ""A big thing is making sure that just kind of calm it down. So I'm going to try to play as soon as I possibly can. I'm itching to get back out there. So as soon as I get the clear and OK, I'll be back out there.""

- He said that could be as soon as Sunday's visit by the Cavaliers.

- Which, based on how the Heat shot 3-pointers Friday, wouldn't be soon enough.

- ""Anything is possible,"" Robinson said. ""I'm not counting out anything. I mean, I want to play obviously as soon as I possibly can. So I don't know for sure when that'll be. You want to try to be smart about it, because I understand probably down the stretch there's going to be some managing of it, just from a pain perspective, which I'm ready to embrace. But you don't want to rush back to where it just flares up, where it's starting back up to day one.""

- Still, optimism, with Friday's Heat performance leaving them in dire need of any optimism.

- ""It's getting better,"" Robinson said. ""It's improving a lot, just taking a couple of days has helped a lot. And then the recovery and treatment stuff has helped as well as other things.""

- Robinson admitted concern when sent to see a specialist, bypassing going to Cleveland with the team for Wednesday night's game.

- ""There's always concern,"" he said. ""You never know. Whenever you get an image on something, you never know. So it was positive news, all things considered. I think the big thing about getting back was to see our people first, but also to start the rest clock. I know I wasn't going to play in Cleveland.""

- Of whether he has experienced previous back problems in his career, Robinson said, ""I had some in high school when I was growing so fast, but that was more of a puberty issue, just catching up to my body. But I've been pretty fortunate, so this is obviously a little setback, but we'll be back soon.""

- Robinson had pulled himself from Monday night's loss in Philadelphia.

- ""Significantly better from Monday,"" he said. ""A lot better from Monday.""

- Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Friday, ""He'll be day to day and we'll see how his body responds to all the treatment he got today and tomorrow and we'll see what's going on.""

- After a one-game absence, Bam Adebayo was back and back in the starting lineup. But with Robinson out again with his back issue, the Heat moved to opening lineup No. 34, this time starting Adebayo, Nikola Jovic, Jimmy Butler, Terry Rozier and Patty Mills.

- The franchise record for lineups had been 31 entering the season.

- With Friday the second Heat start of Mills, who also started Wednesday night's victory in Cleveland.

- Based on how it went Friday for Mills, that opening mix could change again Sunday.

- The Heat remained without Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love and Josh Richardson.

Marysville (3-8, 0-4 PVL) looks to regroup Monday in a nonleague battle against Florin, out of Sacramento, beginning at 4 p.m. at Weldon Field.

Bear River (9-0, 2-0) remained two games back of Sutter (11-0, 4-0) and Wheatland (9-2, 4-0) for the lead in the PVL. The Bruins open up a tournament Monday against Crawford (San Diego).

Sutter will be at the San Diego Lions Tournament where it opens up against San Ysidro, on Monday.

Sutter and Bear River do not play until April 9 in the start of a two-game home-and home series. Bear River looks capable of competing with anyone in the league with Nicholls on the hill. Bear River's star on Thursday used a high leg kick to hide his pitches while effectively painting each side of the plate to flummox Marysville for seven innings.

""It was tough for them all game,"" Barriga said. ""He does a good job staying balanced, loading up and not showing it until the last minute. We struggled picking (it) up.""

Nicholls sent home Marysville in order multiple times through four innings before Benjamin Barajas lined a two-out double in the bottom of the fifth. However, Marysville remained off the scoreboard after Nicholls struck out the next hitter to send the Indians back to the dugout.

One of Marysville's freshmen, Julien Johnson, got the other hit, along with firing three innings of two-hit, zero earned-run baseball to help stem the Bear River tide offensively and keep the game within reach.

""The whole team from last year is gone,"" Barriga said. ""I made the call to get some sophomores and freshmen up here to develop them. (Johnson) is probably the most consistent pitcher we have right now -- not going to overpower you but he has great movement and he does not let anything get to him,"" Barriga said. ""I'm looking forward to working with him going forward.""

Starter Wyatt Lococo received the loss for Marysville.

For Bear River, Cooper Berry had three hits, including a two-out scoring single in the third, to go along with a double, while Jacob Fassler provided two hits and scored a run.

MaxPreps' No. 8 team in the Sac-Joaquin Section edged Twelve Bridges on the road, 2-1 Thursday.

Brady Wickum went 1-for-3 with the lone run batted in for the Huskies.

Wheatland 10, Colfax 3

Joshua Rivera had a pair of hits and RBI, while Kai Hanley drove in four to help Wheatland take care of business at home Thursday to stay unbeaten in league.
