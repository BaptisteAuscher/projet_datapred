Western nations may be getting ahead of themselves in their ambition to swiftly roll out new nuclear power capacity in the current push to reduce dependence on Russian uranium and meet net-zero targets with more nuclear-generated electricity.

At the COP28 climate summit at the end of last year, the United States and 21 other countries pledged to triple nuclear energy capacities by 2050, saying that incorporating more nuclear power in their energy mix is critical for achieving their net zero goals in the coming decades.

The United States, alongside Britain, France, Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Ghana, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), among others, signed the declaration at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai.

""The Declaration recognizes the key role of nuclear energy in achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and keeping the 1.5-degree Celsius goal within reach,"" the U.S. Department of State said.

John Kerry, President Joe Biden's climate envoy, says there are ""trillions of dollars"" available that could be used for investment in nuclear energy.

""We are not making the argument to anybody that this is absolutely going to be the sweeping alternative to every other energy source -- no, that's not what brings us here. But you can't get to net-zero 2050 without some nuclear power,"" he told reporters at the time.

Most Western governments - with the notable exception of Germany - are now betting on nuclear power to help them with the carbon emission targets.

But many may have become too optimistic they would see a fast rollout of nuclear reactors and capacities in an industry notoriously known for years of delays and huge cost overruns.

""Clients, governments and ourselves as the industry players . . . we all become too optimistic,"" Ian Edwards, chief executive of Canada's engineering giant AtkinsRéalis, told the Financial Times.

""We have this optimism bias towards being able to deliver faster.""Related: Big Oil Grows Bolder in Transition Pushback

The stakeholders need to plan better and get the execution phase done right, according to the executive of the company, which manufactures the CANDU reactor, the only nuclear reactor that doesn't need enriched uranium.

The CANDU technology stands for Canada deuterium uranium because it uses deuterium oxide, or heavy water, as a moderator and coolant and uses natural - not enriched - uranium as a fuel.

The West has seen in recent years several cautionary tales of huge delays and cost overruns in looking to boost nuclear capacity. Two of the glaring examples are the UK's Hinkley Point C project by French energy giant EDF and the Vogtle nuclear power plant in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Early this year, EDF pushed back - again - the probable operational start at Hinkley Point C to 2029-2031, depending on various scenarios, compared to the original intention to have the first unit at the plan running in 2025. The costs have gone through the roof - to an estimated $43.5 billion (£34 billion), from $23 billion (£18 billion) budgeted initially.

In Georgia, a new reactor at the Vogtle nuclear power plant began commercial operation last summer in what was the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since 2016. Construction at the two new reactor sites at Vogtle began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion.

AtkinsRéalis, whose natural-uranium reactor design differentiates it from the competition, has a sales pitch advantage because of the Russian dominance in enriched uranium supply, Edwards told FT.

But he warned that demand for AtkinsRéalis's technology is likely to exceed the company's capacity to meet it.

Last year, AtkinsRéalis's revenues from its nuclear division rose by 16.5% compared to 2022, thanks to higher sales volumes from Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Despite the West's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russian uranium, the EU doubled its imports of Russian nuclear fuel last year, mostly due to former Soviet bloc countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia importing Russian fuel for their Soviet-era nuclear plants, NGO Bellona said in an analysis last week, citing data from Eurostat and the UN's international trade service Comtrade.

The United States is doubling down on its own supply of nuclear fuel and technology, including innovative reactor designs.

Soaring uranium prices and a supply squeeze on the global uranium market have prompted U.S. uranium producers to revive abandoned mines that haven't been operational in more than a decade.

Early this year, Uranium Energy Corp said it would restart uranium production at its fully permitted site in Wyoming as the resurgence in nuclear power has led to a new bull market in uranium.

""Uranium market fundamentals are the best the industry has witnessed,"" Uranium Energy president and CEO Amir Adnani said in January.

The U.S. is also backing advanced nuclear technology and small-scale reactors, hyped to be the future of nuclear energy.

This week, TerraPower, a company working on small-scale nuclear reactor development backed by Bill Gates, said it would begin construction on its next-generation nuclear reactor in the United States as soon as June.

TerraPower has been developing the Natrium technology for advanced reactors, which features a sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system.

They say, ""Millions of drivers across the UK will continue to be supported at the pumps from Saturday as the extension to the temporary 5p fuel duty cut for petrol and diesel comes into effect - putting yet more money in people's pockets"".

The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the 12-month extension at the Spring Budget, as well as cancelling the planned inflation increase for 2024/25, saving car drivers around £50 this year and £250 since the 5p cut was introduced - a £13 billion tax cut for motorists overall over three years.

The temporary cut was first introduced in March 2022 to combat high fuel prices after global supply chain issues following the pandemic, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Today's extension takes effect as the government continues to support motorists with rising costs.

They added, ""Taken with recent cuts to National Insurance Contributions - to the tune of around £1800 per household - this is putting even more money in people's pockets. This is only possible because the government stuck to its plan to boost the economy. The economy has now turned a corner and 2024 is set to be the year that Britain bounces back"".

Chancellor for the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said:

Cutting people's tax bill, while protecting our public services, is a priority. We're already saving drivers £50 a year and the average earner £900 a year - and if we stick to our plan, we will go even further, rewarding work and growing our economy.

Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said:

We will always stand by UK drivers and today's fuel duty cut is just one of the ways we are keeping costs down for families. Our plans for a new Pumpwatch will make sure motorists are getting a fair price at the pump.

To mark the extension coming into effect, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury Nigel Huddleston visited an Asda petrol station in Worcestershire on Saturday where he met staff and saw the supermarket chain's more fuel-efficient fleet of vans.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury Nigel Huddleston said:

The last few years have been tough but we're making real progress - which is why we are able to continue to support motorists for another 12 months.

By cutting taxes for working families and sticking to the plan, we can keep building a stronger economy and a brighter future where hard work is rewarded.

RAC head of policy Simon Williams said:

The Government's decision to extend the 5p duty cut is certainly a help to cash-strapped drivers, particularly as this week wholesale fuel prices have risen on the back of a higher oil price.

With the creation of Pumpwatch and a price monitoring body on the horizon, there should soon be more pressure than ever on retailers to price fuel fairly, which will ensure it is only drivers who benefit from the duty cut.

UK Government said, ""The existing duty rates on road fuel gases, which are lower than the equivalent rates on diesel, will also continue to 2032, giving the haulage industry greater certainty over future tax rates and supports the decarbonisation of the UK transport sector"".

Proposals for a new Pumpwatch scheme announced earlier this year will see the UK's 41.2 million drivers get the latest petrol station prices at the click of a button, transforming how the UK shops for its fuel. Under the plans, all fuel stations would be legally required to share live information on their pump prices within 30 minutes of any change in price subject to the outcome of the government's consultation.

This freely available data will enable tech companies to develop new ways for drivers to search for the cheapest fuel while on-the-go and access to this price comparison technology could see drivers save 3p per litre on fuel, while also helping to drive down prices by reigniting competition.",wrexham.com,news,Wrexham.com,,-0.02745098039215688,448988717,1,https://www.wrexham.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/s300_Fuel_Duty_SW_Gov.png,

Members of Parliament are demanding a bias inquiry be made into the BBC after it published accusations by openly antisemitic and pro-Hamas Gazan medical staff, who claimed that they had been tortured and abused by IDF soldiers, according to an exclusive by the Daily Mail published on Sunday.

The allegations aired during the documentary released by the BBC left UK Foreign Minister David Cameron demanding answers from Israel.

Six of the eight medics had repeatedly shared antisemitic slurs on social media, according to the exclusive. This, the Mail argued, ""should, at the very least, have given BBC news executives pause for thought.""

""O Lord, turn every Palestinian missile into a Zionist casualty, and turn every casualty into a thousand families that leave our homeland,"" Dr Amira Al-Assouli, one of the medics who appeared on the televised documentary, reportedly posted online.

""Lord protect our mujahideen [jihadi fighters] and support them with your angels and kill the Jews,"" Al-Assouli reportedly said in a different online post.

On October 7, the day Hamas killed 1200 people and kidnapped over 250 more during a mass terror attack, documentary participant Fayez Saeed Al-Assouli posted a photo of a dead terrorist with the caption ""the first martyr of our family,"" according to the report.

Another doctor who appeared during the documentary, Hatem Raba, wrote on Facebook: ""May Allah guide the missiles of Palestine's mujahideen.""

Raba also allegedly praised a terrorist who killed 38 Israelis, including 13 children, during a 1978 bus-based terror attack.

Hospital General Manager Atef Al-Hout, who claimed the IDF had forced him to kneel for hours with his hands behind his head, had openly praised Hamas.

""Jerusalem and Gaza are in the camp of resistance. May Allah guide your missiles,"" he reportedly wrote in 2021 after Hamas launched missiles at Israel, indiscriminately endangering the lives of Israel and Palestinian civilians.

Dr Amhed Abu Sabha, who claimed muzzled dogs had been released on him and that an IDF soldier broke his arm, reportedly posted in May 2021 that ""'The Jew defiled Jerusalem, ruled with tyranny, and oppressed... O mighty Gaza, the shelling is despicable; we will avenge the heroic martyrs a million-fold.""

In addition to documentary participants sharing the above views online, the Mail claimed that two journalists involved in the report liked posts celebrating attacks on Israel.

The Mail claimed that all six medics refused the opportunity to comment on the findings.

The IDF denied all the allegations aired during the documentary, stating firmly that ""'any abuse of detainees is contrary to IDF orders and is strictly prohibited.""

Condemning the documentary and the BBC

Jewish Tory MP Andrew Percy told The Mail, ""The BBC seemingly doesn't seem to care that it keeps casually giving airtime to people who openly support the murder and assault of innocent civilians through terrorism.

""The BBC seems unable to appreciate that Hamas and their terrorist network have infiltrated every aspect of life in Gaza, even teachers and medical professionals, some of whom helped facilitate the October 7 attacks and hostage-taking.

""There must be a full independent inquiry undertaken of the BBC's failure to uphold impartiality on this issue.

""Their coverage is fuelling the hate on our streets, and it is fuelling anti-Semitism. They must be held to account.""

Theresa Villiers, Tory MP for Chipping Barnet, told the source 'It is shocking our national broadcaster is seemingly basing its reports on the accounts of people who have praised terrorist violence against innocent Israeli citizens.

""The BBC purports to hold itself to high standards for the quality and impartiality of its reporting. It has fallen far short of these standards in this instance, and there needs to be a thorough investigation. Greater care needs to be taken when reporting on such divisive and emotive issues as the Gaza war.""

But anyone who comes out to watch the Titans this season can expect a different strategy being employed.

Many of the power hitters who helped propel Shaler to a run to the PIAA Class 5A championship game last season were lost to graduation.

So, Titans coach Tom Sorce and his team will be forced to use different tactics to win games.

""Obviously, every year is different,"" Sorce said. ""Last year's team had a different makeup with more power. We aren't going to have that power. We are focusing on our defense. If we stay healthy pitching-wise, we will have a chance to win most games.""

Bria Boslijevac is taking over the primary pitching duties this season. Boslijevac, a sophomore, has been focused throughout the offseason on getting better. During the winter, Boslijevac bugged Sorce for more time in the gym.

""She called me in November and asked me to get her gym time,"" Sorce said. ""She was working on her various pitches and spins. That says a lot. Most girls are looking to take a few months off, but she wanted to get more work in.""

Sorce was impressed with how Boslijevac handled herself during her appearances in the state playoffs last season.

""She's a gamer,"" Sorce said. ""She's had the training and plays a strong travel schedule. It wasn't too big of a moment for her.""

Shaler, which finished 22-2 last season and was the WPIAL's third state qualifier, will have plenty of other experience returning as well. Bella Mubel will start at third base. Ella Nash and Emily Spears will both start in the outfield. Sophomore catcher Alyssa Schaffold also returns after earning all-section honors last season.

""We're quicker this year,"" Sorce said. ""It's nice to hit a three-run home run. We did that several times last year. This year, we're going to have to do things from scratch.""

Shaler is in Section 1-5A and will have to battle it out with Fox Chapel, North Hills, Oakland Catholic, Penn Hills and Plum for postseason spots. The Titans would like to find another way to get back to the state playoffs.

After an extra-inning loss to Northern York in the final, Shaler feels like it has some unfinished business.

""They are forced,"" Sorce said. ""They know what happened last year. It got away from us. We're driven to get back there.

Up to 7,500 people are expected to take part in the latest study, announced on Monday, March 18, which will run for five years and see participants in canton Zürich permitted to access regulated cannabis products.

It is also the first pilot to include a comparison group, in which participants will continue to source cannabis illegally, while two other groups in the towns of Winterthur, Schlieren and Horgen, will have access to regulated products from participating pharmacies and stores.

The data from all three groups will then be analyzed in a randomized control trial, which will help to provide ""unbiased evidence"" on the impacts of regulated cannabis sales.

Switzerland was the first European country to introduce pilot programmes for the legalization of adult-use cannabis. To date trials are underway in the cities of Lausanne, Zürich, Liestal, Allschwil, Bern, Bienne, and Lucerne and in the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Geneva.

Under these pilots, thousands of citizens now have access to legal cannabis products.

Data on consumption behavior, as well as the physical and mental health of the participants, is being collected regularly as part of studies being conducted by partnering universities to monitor the effects on public health.

This research will then be used to determine the impact of regulated cannabis markets and help inform future policy.

The first data collected through the 'ZüriCan' pilot was published earlier this month, following its launch in March 2023.

Currently, 1,928 people out of a maximum of 2,100 are enrolled in the study and are eligible to purchase cannabis.

Initially, five different cannabis products with differing levels of THC/CBD and different genotypes were available. However, in December 2023, this expanded to a total of nine products, including five flower and four hash-based.

European cannabis company, Cannavigia, is working closely with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, having developed the software being used to track the amount of cannabis sales and provide data on consumption trends.

Every cannabis package managed through its Cannabis Dispensary System is uniquely marked to provide information about its origin, point of sale and recipient, explained Cannavigia's head of marketing, Tobias Viegener, in an email exchange.

According to Viegener, the findings so far indicate a ""robust demand"" for regulated cannabis across a ""diverse range of products"", with approximately 16,500 sale transactions and 140 kg of cannabis in 5 g packages distributed as part of the pilot to date.

""The initial data from the 'ZüriCan' pilot, published this month, reveals promising insights into the regulated cannabis market's functionality and its acceptance among participants,"" he said.

""This level of engagement indicates a positive reception and an effective distribution system, setting a solid foundation for informing future cannabis policy and regulation.""

The data also highlights patterns in the demographics of those involved in the pilots, with significantly more men (80.5%) than women or non-binary individuals (19.5%) recorded.

This ""notable predominance"" of male participants ""aligns with broader trends observed in national cannabis consumption,"" says Viegener.

Participants have an average age of 35, with those aged 28 to 32-years-old said to be most frequently represented, although the study is said to encompass a broad age range.

Digging deeper into the trends in consumption, the data shows that the majority of participants consumed cannabis four times a week or more and approximately a quarter of the study participants had evidence of a cannabis use disorder before they began accessing regulated products.

Those behind the study believe that introducing regulated sales will reduce the risk of harm among those who fall into this category.

""Regulated distribution of cannabis can create a framework that promotes lower-risk cannabis consumption,"" they state.

""The sales staff at the reference points have been specially trained to provide advice and prevention so that individual, targeted advice is possible. Since study participants always buy their study cannabis from the same source, a closer relationship of trust can develop over time, in which problematic developments can also be identified and discussed.""

All of this will serve as crucial insight, Viegener says, for future policy developments.

""These demographic insights, coupled with the consumption data, are invaluable in understanding the profile of regulated cannabis consumers,"" he adds.

""They provide a nuanced view of the pilot's initial impact, laying the groundwork for more detailed analyses as the study progresses. This approach contributes to a data-driven understanding of cannabis regulation and its potential implications for future policy development.""

Cannavigia's software is also being used in the newly-announced Canton Zürich pilot.

According to Andreas Beerli, head of research from the KOF Swiss Economic Institute at ETH Zürich, which is leading the study, along with The University of Zürich, this research will focus on the social and economic effects of cannabis.

They will examine whether adult-use cannabis has a positive effect on health and public education, for example, alongside any potential negative effects.

The Federal Office of Public Health, states: ""The aim of the pilot trial in the canton of Zürich is to investigate the social and economic consequences of legalising recreational cannabis use in Switzerland.

""In addition, the effects of a self-regulation programme for the prevention of excessive cannabis use are to be studied. This involves a randomised controlled trial (RCT).""

Viegener says he expects these findings to be positive.

""Regulation can reduce illicit cannabis trade, ensure product safety and quality, and generate tax revenue,"" he says.

""Socially, it can contribute to reduced crime rates associated with the illegal market and improve public health through controlled access and education around safe consumption practices.

""Economically, creating a legal market can stimulate job creation and provide new revenue streams for public services. The ongoing pilot studies, including the one in Canton Zurich focusing on these impacts, will offer empirical data to validate these expectations.""

With adult-use pilots either underway or planned in a number of major cities, the Federal Office of Public Health's commitment to ""understanding the comprehensive impacts of regulated cannabis sales"" suggests further pilots could be rolled out in the future, Viegener believes.

""While specific plans for further pilots depend on the outcomes and learnings from current studies, the positive progression and valuable insights gained so far indicate a strong foundation for future research initiatives,"" he adds.

""While there exists interest and intentions to conduct further pilots, the primary focus of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is to ensure that the research thesis yields additional insights into market structure.""",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.09019607843137245,448988451,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66003d3472c407de2ecff5df/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,

Amy Klobuchar says regional water supply project will benefit generations to come","Mar. 24 -- HALSTAD, Minn. -- Less than 12 hours after the U.S. Senate passed a funding package and averted a government shutdown, Sen. Amy Klobuchar had made her way from Washington, D.C. to Halstad, Minnesota.

What brought her there was the West Central Regional Water District, which she helped to secure $3.5 million in federal funding for. The project is estimated to cost between $18.5 million and $23.25 million in its first phase.

""It's expensive, but I also know how important it is,"" said Klobuchar, D-MN. ""You're really doing it for future generations.""

The project meeting, which took place at the Halstad Telephone Company building on Saturday afternoon, March 23, brought together area mayors, city employees and county commissioners.

The project was proposed after water quality issues were identified throughout the region, including rural and urban areas. Arsenic, iron, maganese and nitrates are some documented concerns.

Private wells were sampled throughout three west central Minnesota counties. The percentage of wells with more than the maximum contaminent level of 10 micrograms of arsenic per liter were 43% in Norman County, 39% in Clay County and 21% in Polk County.

Long-term exposure to arsenic increases risk of cancer, nervous system issues and high blood pressure, according to the WCRWD initiatives and progress presentation shared Saturday.

Other identified issues are aging infrastructures, lack of licensed operators, high capital costs and emerging contaminants.

Curt Johannsen, mayor of Hendrum, Minnesota, said he's looking at the project as the most cost-effective way to maintain the town's system in the future.

""We feel this is the best long-term, sustainable goal for our community,"" Johannsen said.

In addition to providing healthy drinking water for current residents, some spoke about the project's potential economic impacts.

Ann Kruse, mayor of Perley, Minnesota, said more clean water would potentially bring younger couples and families out to rural areas, therefore boosting the economy. Johannsen agreed, citing agricultural benefits.

""Ag is our biggest driving sector here,"" he said. ""They need (adequate water) to maintain operations for spraying.""

Federal funds for the project were secured with assistance from Klobuchar; Sen. Tina Smith, D-MN; and Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-MN. Of the $3.5 million approved, half will be dedicated to Norman County, and the other half will be given to Georgetown and Felton.

A grant application for additional funds has been submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health. Other funding sources are being explored though various cities and counties have already begun making contributions.

Phase one of the West Central Regional Water District is to study, design and construct a drinking water pipeline that will benefit southwestern Polk, western Norman and northern Clay counties.

In the future, additional phases would expand the service area. The group discussed the possibility of collaborating with the state of North Dakota for potential water sources.

""I think (North Dakota legislators) might be helpful to us,"" Klobuchar said. ""... The synergy is really important.""",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo! Finance,,0.08235294117647052,448988401,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

During his 90-minute presentation last month on making Lafayette more walkable, national city planner and author Jeff Speck paused twice to point out what he thought was a great opportunity.

While he had the attention of the nearly packed auditorium at the Acadiana Center for the Arts, Speck identified the empty property across from The Lofts at the Municipal Apartments as being prime for a residential project.

Why? Mostly because the Buchanan Street parking garage -- building a parking garage can drive up the cost of a project by 30% -- is already there.

Downtown Lafayette can expect more residential units, and that's a good place to start.

""The parking lot, I'm told, is half full and probably overnight it's empty,"" Speck said. ""This is money in the bank for a developer who wants to put wants to put housing here without parking. So you should be locating new housing within a block or so.""

Residential continues to be a hot topic in downtown Lafayette and will be the topic of the Lunch N Learn event at noon Tuesday hosted by Downtown Lafayette Unlimited at the Downtown Convention Center, 124 S. Buchanan St.

Laurie Volk, part of Zimmerman/Volk Associates, which analyzes residential markets in cities across the country, will discuss the latest updates to the firm's Lafayette report, which was first released almost 20 years ago. The report showed the potential market for housing in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods.

The firm has completed a third update, which indicates the demand is still there in the form of 950-1,205 units over five years with 190-241 units that could be leased or sold within a year.

That demand, however, is outpacing supply.

""More activity has happened in downtown Lafayette from when I started the first study in 2006,"" Volk said. ""You have been really doing the right things. It may not meet our absorption projects, but that's not very typical (to do so). There are a lot of challenges, but at least you know there's a lot of potential for new downtown housing development.""

Providing that supply, however, has its challenges.

It's been about six months since the latest project, The Monroe, opened and added 70 units to the downtown mix. Other projects have since been discussed and are in motion, including a mid-sized project along Congress Street and the project Rock 'N' Bowl owner Johnny Blancher is reworking near the Lafayette City Court buildings.

Interest rates and high construction costs are slowing any activity, but other projects could gain momentum at some point, said Kevin Blanchard, CEO of the Downtown Development Authority. The old Coburn's building could be redeveloped and have a residential component, and talks are advancing for a hotel downtown.

""All the advice I've gotten from folks is, like, do not rest,"" Blanchard said. ""People are putting deals together right now. When the time is right and interest rates start to drop, then they can pull the trigger.""

The infrastructure

The lift station that went in two years ago along the northern edge of downtown added about 500 additional gallons per minute of sewer capacity.

Growth pushed that to capacity, and now the lift station issue is back and has the potential to stunt downtown's growth yet again. Lafayette Utilities System, according to The Current, is planning a $10 million investment in the center of Lafayette to upgrade the sewer system but has yet to break ground on it.

Walkability in downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods are also key issues, said Rachel Holland, DDA's director of development and planning. There are several people living downtown who are either students or professors at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and walking improvements would make downtown a more viable residential option.

The report also noted that empty nesters are making up the second-biggest market for downtown living, behind young adults. Developers should explore housing alternatives, including duplexes and townhomes.

""We know that people are looking to buy downtown,"" Holland said. ""There are really only rental options right now. So I think introducing townhouses or a condo-style development could attract different types of people.""

Land, land, land

That property Speck pointed out to the Lafayette audience? Twice Lafayette Consolidated Government sought proposals on parcels it owns, and both tries gained no traction.

LCG owns only one parcel that fronts Jefferson Street. The other two are privately owned.

Then there's Blancher's project. Convent & Lee, the massive 208-unit plan that would have occupied the lots of the current city court offices and been a joint project with the City of Lafayette, is now dead, but Blancher says he is optimistic something will happen on the lots he owns behind city court.

He has no details yet on what it could be. He will likely have to start over, including refiling for the Housing and Urban Development 221(d)(4) loan that is used for multifamily projects.

""Look, I'm going to redevelop my property sooner or later,"" he said. ""I am optimistic I will end up doing a great project. I don't want to say I'm pessimistic, but I'm going to proceed with caution as to whether or not there's city involvement and to what level.""

Another is the site near the federal courthouse that developer Cliff Guidry planned two 20-story high-rise towers that would have been the tallest buildings in Lafayette.

Commercial real estate agent Tim Skinner bought the land, just under an acre, in late 2022 and is still weighing options with what to do with it.

Early efforts to lure a hotel there were unsuccessful, he said, and now he's hoping to use it for either mixed use or straight residential. His lots are connected to six others that are privately owned but, if combined, would total about 2.5 acres that would have frontage along Congress Street.

""I've talked to almost every architect in town, and everybody seems to almost talk you out of doing anything because of the cost right now,"" Skinner said. ""The highest and best use for that lot would be high density, which means you need to go vertical. That's just hard to do right now.""",theadvocate.com,news,The Advocate,Adam Daigle,0.04313725490196085,448988384,12,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/3b/73b93f80-ed08-5315-904e-ee2f4d548211/62fab080991ca.image.jpg?crop=1895%2C995%2C0%2C49&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

Some of these even demonstrated physical principles - including Newton's cradle with its suspended spheres that clacked back and forth.

For me, the most mysterious of these toys is the drinking bird. Often called a dippy bird, it pivots about an axle, continuously dipping its beak in and out of a container of liquid with no obvious source of power.

Rather than being a perpetual motion machine, a dippy bird is a heat engine. It comprises two glass bulbs of different sizes that are connected by a glass tube. The tube is attached to the axle so the dumbbell-like configuration can rotate. A ""beak"" made of absorbent material such as felt is attached to the smaller bulb which forms the head of the bird.

The interior of bird is partially filled with a liquid that is highly volatile such as methylene chloride. If the beak is dipped into a glass of water and then removed, evaporation will cause the upper bulb to cool, causing some of the vapour in it to condense and the pressure to drop.

This mismatch in pressure will cause some liquid from the lower bulb to flow up to the top bulb. The now top heavy bird will dip down, putting its beak into the water and starting the process all over again.

So, lots of idle fun watching the bird drink - but how can the effect be used to generate electricity?

When working as a postdoc at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hao Wu was trying to boost the voltage created by an evaporation energy generator. She thought of the dippy bird and realized that it could have practical uses beyond demonstrating thermodynamics.

Now a professor at the South China University of Technology, Wu and her colleagues began with a commercial dippy bird toy, which they modified by adding two triboelectric nanogenerator modules. These generate energy from the transfer of electric charge between two surfaces that move across each other. In this case the surfaces were fixed to the pivoting bird and the stationary stand.

The big challenge for the researchers was to minimize the friction at the interface, while still generating electricity. When they got it right, their dippy bird achieved an output voltage exceeding 100 V and could power 20 liquid-crystal displays.

The team is now exploring practical applications for their dippy device.

In a press release dated March 24, the VRA clarified that the assertion of failing to meet Ghana's power supply needs is unfounded and misleading.

""The VRA wishes to clarify that since 1972, it has consistently supplied electricity to neighboring nations without neglecting its responsibility to provide reliable and affordable power to Ghana,"" stated parts of the release.

Furthermore, the VRA emphasized that the distribution of power generated from the Akosombo and Kpong hydroelectric stations is overseen by the Electricity Market Oversight Panel (EMOP), not directly controlled by the VRA.

The VRA elaborated that due to this oversight structure, electricity allocation prioritizes the Ghanaian market, aligning with government strategies aimed at optimizing the nation's hydro resources in the long term.

These statements came in response to IPGG's claims that the ongoing power outages stem from VRA's excessive focus on exporting electricity, neglecting local demands.

Dr. Elikplim Kwabla Apetorgbor, CEO of IPGG, highlighted that while the VRA is encouraged to explore export opportunities to reduce idle-capacity burdens on the government, such endeavors must comply with legal frameworks.

""It is a regulatory requirement to ensure the domestic demand is met whilst maintaining the set 18% reserve margin"", he explained in an interview with myjoyonline.

""It is a great disservice to mother Ghana and Ghanaians for VRA to be exporting the most affordable hydro generation to neighbouring countries - Burkina Faso, Togo and Benin whilst the Ministry of Energy, PURC [Public Utilities Regulator Commission] and ECG [Electricity Company of Ghana] remain unconcerned and force the Ghanaian taxpayers pay for the expensive thermal generation and also sleep in the dark"", he continued.

Smugglers on Sunday attacked and injured a Nigerian customs officer around Sahuda, a border town between Nigeria and the Republic of Cameroon, SaharaReporters has learnt.

Officers attached to the Adamawa/Taraba Area Command were attacked while blocking the smugglers from ferrying Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol to the Republic of Cameroon.

They were said to have intercepted the smugglers around Sahuda, a border town in the Mubi South Local Government Area of Adamawa State.

The smugglers reportedly turned violent and mobilised a mob who attacked the officers with clubs and daggers. They also smashed a patrol van in the process. They were about to set the officers ablaze when military officers came to their rescue.

Comptroller of the Area command, Salisu Abdullahi Kazaure, confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters on Sunday.

Kazaure said an Incident Report had been forwarded to the customs headquarters in Abuja.

The Indent Report seen by SaharaReporters reads in part, ""On Sunday 17th March 2024 at about 1130hours following the unwavering efforts of the Command Officers for effective border management and to suppress smuggling activities at the Command's territorial borders, the Command operatives led by SC T Suleiman, comprising ASCI UU Abdullahi, ASCI MS Ibrahim and others while on information patrol along Mubi-Sahuda road intercepted three (3) tricycle (Kekenapep) loaded with Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) suspected to be smuggled goods being taken out of the Country into the Republic of Cameroon.

""An attempt by the officers to prevent the smuggling of the product, the smugglers launched a mob attack on them and even tried to burn the officers alongside the official vehicles.

""The swift intervention and re-enforcement from the Nigerian Army saved the situation. However, one of our officers was terribly wounded and the windscreen of one of the operational vehicles was smashed.

""The officers were able to secure, evacuate and bring 45x25L Jerry Cans of the PMS from the tricycles to the station amidst the struggle.""

Western nations may be getting ahead of themselves in their ambition to swiftly roll out new nuclear power capacity in the current push to reduce dependence on Russian uranium and meet net-zero targets with more nuclear-generated electricity.

At the COP28 climate summit at the end of last year, the United States and 21 other countries pledged to triple nuclear energy capacities by 2050, saying that incorporating more nuclear power in their energy mix is critical for achieving their net zero goals in the coming decades.

The United States, alongside Britain, France, Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Ghana, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), among others, signed the declaration at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai.

""The Declaration recognizes the key role of nuclear energy in achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and keeping the 1.5-degree Celsius goal within reach,"" the U.S. Department of State said.

John Kerry, President Joe Biden's climate envoy, says there are ""trillions of dollars"" available that could be used for investment in nuclear energy.

""We are not making the argument to anybody that this is absolutely going to be the sweeping alternative to every other energy source -- no, that's not what brings us here. But you can't get to net-zero 2050 without some nuclear power,"" he told reporters at the time.

Most Western governments - with the notable exception of Germany - are now betting on nuclear power to help them with the carbon emission targets.

But many may have become too optimistic they would see a fast rollout of nuclear reactors and capacities in an industry notoriously known for years of delays and huge cost overruns.

""Clients, governments and ourselves as the industry players . . . we all become too optimistic,"" Ian Edwards, chief executive of Canada's engineering giant AtkinsRéalis, told the Financial Times.

""We have this optimism bias towards being able to deliver faster.""Related: Big Oil Grows Bolder in Transition Pushback

The stakeholders need to plan better and get the execution phase done right, according to the executive of the company, which manufactures the CANDU reactor, the only nuclear reactor that doesn't need enriched uranium.

The CANDU technology stands for Canada deuterium uranium because it uses deuterium oxide, or heavy water, as a moderator and coolant and uses natural - not enriched - uranium as a fuel.

The West has seen in recent years several cautionary tales of huge delays and cost overruns in looking to boost nuclear capacity. Two of the glaring examples are the UK's Hinkley Point C project by French energy giant EDF and the Vogtle nuclear power plant in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Early this year, EDF pushed back - again - the probable operational start at Hinkley Point C to 2029-2031, depending on various scenarios, compared to the original intention to have the first unit at the plan running in 2025. The costs have gone through the roof - to an estimated $43.5 billion (£34 billion), from $23 billion (£18 billion) budgeted initially.

In Georgia, a new reactor at the Vogtle nuclear power plant began commercial operation last summer in what was the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since 2016. Construction at the two new reactor sites at Vogtle began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion.

AtkinsRéalis, whose natural-uranium reactor design differentiates it from the competition, has a sales pitch advantage because of the Russian dominance in enriched uranium supply, Edwards told FT.

But he warned that demand for AtkinsRéalis's technology is likely to exceed the company's capacity to meet it.

Last year, AtkinsRéalis's revenues from its nuclear division rose by 16.5% compared to 2022, thanks to higher sales volumes from Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Despite the West's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russian uranium, the EU doubled its imports of Russian nuclear fuel last year, mostly due to former Soviet bloc countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia importing Russian fuel for their Soviet-era nuclear plants, NGO Bellona said in an analysis last week, citing data from Eurostat and the UN's international trade service Comtrade.

The United States is doubling down on its own supply of nuclear fuel and technology, including innovative reactor designs.

Soaring uranium prices and a supply squeeze on the global uranium market have prompted U.S. uranium producers to revive abandoned mines that haven't been operational in more than a decade.

Early this year, Uranium Energy Corp said it would restart uranium production at its fully permitted site in Wyoming as the resurgence in nuclear power has led to a new bull market in uranium.

""Uranium market fundamentals are the best the industry has witnessed,"" Uranium Energy president and CEO Amir Adnani said in January.

The U.S. is also backing advanced nuclear technology and small-scale reactors, hyped to be the future of nuclear energy.

This week, TerraPower, a company working on small-scale nuclear reactor development backed by Bill Gates, said it would begin construction on its next-generation nuclear reactor in the United States as soon as June.

TerraPower has been developing the Natrium technology for advanced reactors, which features a sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The Natrium demonstration plant will be built near a retiring coal facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming.",therussophile.org,news,TheRussophiles,,0.2941176470588236,448988154,12,https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-21_u4dy0xt5zu.jpg?fit=500%2C209&ssl=1,

The demand was made during a media briefing by office bearers of National Lobbying Delegation (NLD) for Minority Rights, a group of writers, members of civil society organizations, rights activists, journalists and lawyers who promote rights of non-Muslim Pakistani citizens guaranteed in the Constitution.

NLD office bearers including its focal person, Haroon Sarab Diyal, Romana Bashir, Dr Kalyan Singh, Shezad Francis and Habqooq were present in the briefing.

""The Succession Act, 1925 provides rules for both intestate and testate succession, ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of property among the legal heirs of a deceased person,"" said Haroon Sarab Diyal.

However, the implementation of the Succession Act, 1925 faces several challenges such as cultural factors, lack of awareness and lengthy legal processes that hinder the realization of the rights of heirs especially women and minorities, he added.

""A well-functioning and updated Succession Act, 1925 is essential for promoting justice, certainty and the protection of rights in matters of inheritance and succession in Pakistan,"" suggests Romana Bashir, a seasoned peace activist.

Further strengthening of the legal system is also required to address the specific needs and issues of the Christian and Hindu communities who constitute the largest religious minorities in the country, she continued.

National Lobbying Delegation (NLD) for Minority Rights members also made some suggestions to improve the legal system for inheritance and succession matters.

""An awareness campaign is required to sensitize the members of Christian community, clergy and revenue officers about the laws and framework available for distribution of inheritance of the Christian community,"" they suggested.

Adding that the section 29 to 49 of the Succession Act, 1925 provide a comprehensive framework for distribution of inheritance of persons belonging to Christian community and discuss in detail the respective shares of all the legal heirs, while the community members, clergy and other representatives have very little knowledge about the laws and framework.

The also submitted that for Hindu community, the existing law does not provide any uniform mechanism for the distribution of inheritance among the heirs.

A special law regulating the inheritance and succession matters of persons belonging to Hindu community be drafted, keeping in view the examples of neighboring countries where Hindus are residing in large population and their Succession Act, 1956 is amended and in implementation phase.

The proposed law should be drafted after consultation with jurists, clergy and community representatives in Pakistan to ensure that if reflects the needs and aspirations of the Hindu community, they added.

NLD members urged the government to resolve these issues accordingly as because of lack of Inheritance Laws for Non-Muslim citizens.",urdupoint.com,news,UrduPoint,,0.3019607843137255,448988057,1,https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png,

It's even rarer to witness a total eclipse. For many of us, we finally are in the right spot, at the right time.

A total solar eclipse is set to occur on April 8 and northern New England is in a prime spot to see the phenomenon.

During a solar eclipse, the moon blocks people's view of the sun. Depending on where you're located, it'll partially block the sun or completely cover it, leaving a ring of fire in the sky. This ring is the sun's corona, which is something we usually can't see due to the star's brightness.

Full coverage of the sun by the moon is called a state of ""totality."" If you're lucky enough to be in the path of totality, the complete coverage of the sun usually lasts between three and four minutes, according to NASA. The sudden daytime darkness can even trick some nocturnal animals in the area to awaken, thinking the day has ended.

NASA has an interactive map that tracks the eclipse's journey across the Earth by the fraction of a second.

Keep in mind, viewing such an event is all contingent on clear weather. On April 8, we'll cross our fingers for a clear afternoon.

Let us be clear: staring directly at the sun will damage your eyes. The longer you gawk, the more damage you could do to your retinal cells. Even a quick, direct glance can cause damage.

Staring at an eclipse in progress is no different, but there are safe ways to visually take in the event.

The most common is with solar viewing glasses, according to the American Astronomical Society. These are not your ordinary sunglasses, by the way; they're thousands of times darker for your safety. If you plan on using these specialized glasses, just make sure they're made with the right solar filters. The best way to check is to see if the glasses are compliant with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standards -- this will almost always be printed on the inside of the glasses frame, according to the American Astronomical Society.

The glasses aren't a panacea, however. Don't look at the sun ""through camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while wearing eclipse glasses or using a handheld solar viewer -- the concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and cause serious eye injury,"" states NASA.

You could also use a handheld solar viewer or try an indirect viewing methods like a pinhole projection.

With all that said, there is one exception. If you're viewing the solar eclipse in the path of totality and the sun is completely covered by the moon, it is safe to look at it. It's the moments leading up to the state of totality that can cause damage, according to NASA.

""When the bright photosphere of the sun is completely covered, only the faint light from the corona is visible, and this radiation is too weak to have any harmful effects on the human retina,"" NASA said in a total solar eclipse FAQ. ""There is a misunderstanding that during a total solar eclipse, when the moon has fully blocked the light from the sun, there are still harmful rays that can injure your eyes. This is false.""

Even with that very specific caveat, just be smart about viewing if you're planning to check out the event. A safe eclipse viewing is a great eclipse viewing!

The path of totality is cruising right through areas of northern New England, and you've hit the jackpot if you're in certain areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, or Maine. Residents of the other states -- Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut -- are less lucky and will only see a partial eclipse.

NASA identified the more populated areas in New England that are within the path of totality. Check out the times listed below if you're planning to watch the astronomical event come April.

If you're traveling to Vermont to catch a glimpse of the total solar eclipse in its full glory, Vermont Public Radio put together a great compilation of events taking place across the state.

If you aren't in the area for this total solar eclipse, don't fret. There are more eclipses ahead with different paths across the globe.

NASA compiled future eclipse dates and regions if you're looking to plan ahead. It just depends on where you are -- it's all about being at the right place at the right time (although we realize the ones in Antarctica may just be out of the question).",ctpublic.org,news,Connecticut Public,,-0.05882352941176472,448988034,1,https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40be80d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F2f%2Ff88810364b999cc5819d8dc684fb%2Ftotal-solar-eclipse.jpg,eng-9413446

The experience of being seen, heard, and accepted for who you are shapes your sense of belonging. Whether it's on a playground as children or in the workplace as adults, the need to belong remains a constant.

Reflecting on your own experiences, you may be able to recall moments of inclusion as well as exclusion -- how feeling welcomed, valued, and respected fostered a sense of belonging, while being judged or overlooked left you feeling disconnected. Each of us has a story of when we felt like we did belong and how significant that feeling was.

In the workplace, cultivating a culture of belonging is everything. At the heart of every successful team is a sense of inclusion and acceptance. Recognizing this, our team prioritizes creating an environment where every member feels valued and understood.

Monthly check-ins serve as a platform for team members to share not only their work-related concerns but also personal challenges. By understanding each other's experiences, we can provide the necessary support and encouragement.

What does it mean to belong? Recently, members of our team reflected on their perspectives on belonging. Here's some of what they shared:

""I feel like I belong when people reach out to me, ask me my thoughts, encourage me to share. In meetings, as an introvert, sometimes I get quiet, especially if there are lots of loud opinions. I will rarely elbow my way into the conversation. But if even one person notices my silence and asks what I'm thinking, I suddenly feel seen and then heard.""

""I experience belonging when I notice that I am not questioning other people's motives or values.""

""How do I know I belong? When I feel heard and understood. To feel heard, I hope that another or others are with me as I share, not agreeing with me, but rather getting what I am saying, conveying and relating with their words, with their eyes, and face, and body. Once I feel heard, when the other or others mirror back to me what I've conveyed, I feel understood, and I relax. Knowing and believing that I've said what I wanted to say, and seeing it acknowledged through body language, eyes, nods, reflections of me from them.""

""My experience of belonging is really affected by me welcoming and allowing myself to be part of something bigger than just me and committing to participating in something that I sometimes avoid.""

""I feel like I belong when I'm at my peak level of excitement and someone can stick with that force. A raised eyebrow or a smirk that says, 'Whoa,' is fine; it's like we're in on the joke of my big energy together. But when someone shifts away, physically recoils, or worse, shushes me, I withdraw. I will withhold myself instantly, for fear of being too much, too loud, too big, too passionate, too direct. Belonging feels like those who accept me for who I am.""

These are moving testaments to the power of belonging. Unfortunately, the reality in many workplaces is that there may be any number of individuals who have experienced exclusion or felt the need to hide aspects of their identity to fit in at work. This not only undermines their sense of belonging but can also impact performance.

If you're wondering what belonging has to do with work performance, the answer is simple: Everything.

Research published in the Harvard Business Review on The Value of Belonging at Work demonstrates just how closely belonging is connected to both individual and overall business performance:

""If workers feel like they belong, companies reap substantial bottom-line benefits. High belonging was linked to a whopping 56% increase in job performance, a 50% drop in turnover risk, and a 75% reduction in sick days. For a 10,000-person company, this would result in annual savings of more than $52M.""

Whether you're working in a 10,000-person or a 10-person company, those numbers add up.

As a leader, you play an essential role in shaping an organizational culture that fosters high performance and success -- for individuals, the team, and the business as a whole. Creating an inclusive environment where each person feels valued for who they are enhances employee engagement and overall satisfaction. It means people have both the support and the motivation to show up and contribute their full talents every day. Who wouldn't want to lead and work in an environment like that?

Belonging isn't a luxury; it's a necessity for team members to thrive at work. By fostering an environment of acceptance, understanding, and appreciation, you can unleash the full potential of every team member. Commit to building a workplace where everyone feels like they truly belong.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.4274509803921569,448987723,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdce50dbf63b3272222a15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,

Representatives of civil society, child rights organizations, human rights commissions, legal experts, journalists, and political parties gathered outside the National Press Club in Islamabad on Sunday to demand swift intervention to ensure the recovery and safety of the abducted child.

The situation escalated when a video surfaced from an undisclosed location in Mansehra, purportedly showing Falak claiming to have been married to a 17-year-old boy in a court in Haripur. This revelation has brought to light serious concerns regarding child marriage, a violation of both legal and ethical standards.

The protesters and speakers emphasized the urgent need for a thorough and transparent investigation to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Particular scrutiny has been placed on the role of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Rights Commission, given that the unlawful marriage took place within its jurisdiction.

The protesters and speakers raised questions regarding the commission's response and its obligations in such cases.

Civil society organizations underscored the vulnerability of the child and stressed the importance of the swift recovery of the girl to protect her from further harm and exploitation.

The speakers emphatically demanded immediate recovery of the child and her presentation before a court of law. They stressed the importance of utilizing authentic medical and legal methods to accurately determine the child's age.

Additionally, they called for thorough investigations into the conduct of the Nikah reader, registrar, and the doctor responsible for issuing the age certificate. Transparency was urged in investigating serious allegations against certain police officials, ensuring accountability.

Describing the situation as a grave instance of child abduction, internal trafficking, forced early marriage, and child sexual abuse, speakers highlighted the urgent need for action, and raised their voiced over the apparent ineffectiveness of Gilgit-Baltistan police in recovering the abducted child, despite the passage of 54 days since the incident was reported.

They said that the victim's father has lamented the delays in registering the FIR and has leveled serious allegations against certain police officials.

While a FIR was lodged on January 20, 2024, at Danyore Police Station in Gilgit, the lack of tangible progress in the case has fueled frustration and discontent among the protesters.

The protesters also issued a stark warning, expressing that if the relevant departments fail to intervene and address the situation promptly, it could escalate into widespread unrest among the masses.

In November, the company had announced the demerger of its transmission business into a separate entity. In an interview, Agarwal said the company is awaiting the approval for the demerger from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and expects the process to be completed by the second quarter of FY25.

""The most suitable business for the public markets is our manufacturing business. There are multiple listed players in that space -- some are in B2B, some in B2C -- and some are capitalizing on the Indian growth story. We are also riding a global growth wave, with 50% of our business coming from exports. We have 40 customers across the US, Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Australia. So, it is very suitable. Post-demerger, we will evaluate all fundraising options,"" he added.

""We have no urgency, but we will certainly evaluate all options. If the markets are favourable and, depending on investor interest, we will surely consider a listing of the manufacturing business.""

The company is also considering expanding its existing manufacturing facilities in India, besides setting up a new facility, Agarwal said. ""The total investment for expansion (both brownfield and greenfield) should be in the range of ₹350-400 crore.""

The manufacturing business is projected to grow 20-30% in FY25, buoyed by the around ₹2 trillion worth of central sector transmission projects in India.

The company is also in talks with private equity investors for raising funds for its transmission business, he said. ""That is the business where we operate like a highway operator, where we build, own and operate transmission lines, providing transmission services to end users, generators, and consumers. That business is growing very, very fast. And then we're looking at closing a large transaction with a very large investor, which we hope to finalize soon.""

The company's transmission division also operates in Brazil. It boasts a portfolio of 30 completed and ongoing projects, totaling around 14,602 circuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines across India and Brazil. It is focussing on consolidating its presence further in India's transmission sector.

Agrawal, the chairman of SPTL subsidiary Serentica Renewables, said the company is furthering its ambitions in the round-the-clock renewable energy solutions. ""At Serentica, we aim to provide round-the-clock renewable energy solutions to large factories by selling renewable power. These large-scale, energy-intensive factories currently rely on thermal power consumption. Our goal is to replace 15-50% of their thermal power with renewable power.""

""Currently, one of the most interesting opportunities in the whole decarbonization space is how to replace carbon consumption of these large factories, which are responsible for consuming 80% of greenhouse gases worldwide, with renewables,"" he said.

""We will certainly deploy batteries across our fleet in different shapes, forms, and sizes. Additionally, we will explore alternative forms of storage, whether owned by us, or by a third party, and then contracted to us.""

On 20 March, Mint reported that Serentica was planning to sell a minority stake to raise around $300 million to fund its ambitious growth plans.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid, in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a note.

Since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have amounted to at least $11.5bn in losses for Ukraine, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Energy Svitlana Hrynchuk said on air on March 23.

The renewed campaign is the biggest since November 2023, when Russia started targeting Ukraine's power infrastructure and then launched a massive barrage of missile strikes in January this year designed to use up Ukraine's dwindling supplies of air defence missiles.

The massive Russian offensive started on March 21 and has left nearly 1.5mn Ukrainians without electricity. The Deputy Head of the Presidential Office, Oleksii Kuleba, reported the widespread outages following the barrage of over 150 drones and missiles targeting various cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine.

The eastern regions bore the brunt of the attacks, with Kharkiv and its neighbouring areas experiencing the most significant disruptions. As of late morning on the day of the attack, approximately 700,000 residents in those areas were plunged into darkness after power supplies failed.

Other affected regions included the Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Poltava Oblasts, with 250,000, 200,000 and 110,000 residents respectively facing power outages - the first blackouts in over a year. Until the current campaign, Ukraine's air defences have worked effectively, knocking out the bulk of inbound Russian missiles. But as supplies run low, Ukraine's air defences are increasingly incapable of preventing Russian missiles from reaching their targets, some of which are taking multiple hits in the same day. The Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Sumy and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts also reported disruptions.

Efforts to restore power commenced immediately, with the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo confirming by early afternoon on March 22 that electricity had been reinstated in all regions except for the Kharkiv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts.

""An emergency shutdown had to be implemented in the morning during the attack due to the largest mass attack on Ukraine's energy grid,"" Ukrenergo's head, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said as cited by Kyiv Independent.

Zaporizhzhia's Dnipro hydroelectric power plant (HPP), one of Ukraine's largest, lost about a third of its generation capacity after a Russian missile strike, the head of Ukrainian state-owned energy company Ukrhydroenergo, Ihor Syrota, told the Associated Press.

The strikes have resulted in casualties and considerable damage to energy facilities, including the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, which has been knocked out of action and is now in a ""critical condition"", according to its director. The plant suffered severe damage to one of its stations. Syrota highlighted the dire situation at the HPP, where two missiles inflicted significant damage on the hydroelectric power station-2 (HPS-2), jeopardising its operational capacity. ""So far, we are losing the station,"" Syrota lamented, noting that the adjacent dam had also sustained damage, albeit without immediate risk of a breach, the Kyiv Independent reports.

At least three fatalities and 26 injuries have been reported across the country due to the attacks. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko condemned the strikes on Facebook, saying: ""The enemy launched one of the largest attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent weeks,"" with the apparent aim of causing widespread disruption to the country's energy system.

As emergency services continue their efforts at the damaged sites, the full extent of the destruction and the potential for recovery remains uncertain. This attack marks a significant escalation in the targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, underscoring the ongoing challenges faced by the nation amidst the conflict.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been making desperate appeals to his Western allies for more air defence ammunition, but so far these appeals have gone unheeded.

According to a US military assessment published last November, Ukraine will run out of long-range missiles in the first two months of this year, air defence rockets in March and the crucial artillery shells that are the workhorse of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) by summer. So far the first two parts of that assessment have already come to pass, and the outlook for increased shell supplies from the West appears to be in doubt.

Russia may follow through on its advantage with a new offensive, according to experts. Russia is gathering 100,000-strong force, possibly for a summer offensive, Ukraine's Ground Forces Commander Oleksandr Pavliuk said on national television on March 22.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.3725490196078431,448987411,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Ukraine_industry_factory_energy_power_station_electricity_business_0_0.jpeg,eng-9416762

A Cincinnati Reds fan is getting some cheesy public shaming! A new billboard in Covington, Kentucky, features an unidentified man, who allegedly consumes a staggering ""over 20 gallons of liquid cheese a year!"" The photo shows the bearded, bespectacled man sadly digging into a tub of mac and cheese.

The mastermind behind the playful prank? A friend from across the river in northern Kentucky, Jonathan Pittman. Inspired by a casual sighting of his pal enjoying mac and cheese, Mr Pittman snapped a photo and turned it into a billboard for over $1,200. It's set to stay up for four weeks, offering a lighthearted jab at his friend's cheese obsession.

WCPO 9 in its special report, ""Who is Cheese Guy?,"" the station said Mr Pittman wouldn't confirm if his cheesy chum actually eats that much mac 'n cheese.

The station reported that Pittman simply ""decided it'd be funny to put his friend on display.""

The billboard has garnered some traction on social media, with a picture of it shared on Reddit.

See the post here:

Still, following a pandemic that changed the landscape for many economic sectors, the hybrid shopping model has become table stakes.

Rick West, CEO of Field Agent, a research and retail data collection firm in Fayetteville, said omnichannel retail is here to stay, and retailers have to make room for omnichannel and the hybrid shopping experience because customers expect it.

""Specifically, from the retailer perspective, the omnichannel experience will shift again in 2024,"" West said.

He said shoppers want every option and to be served efficiently whether shopping online, in physical stores or some combination of both. He said that in 2022 and 2023, many top retailers moved their staff from front checkout lanes to accommodate online pickup and delivery. West said retailers saw that as temporary, and many still needed to change their backrooms.

""And now, based on the work we're seeing at Field Agent, many retailers are coming to the conclusion that the hybrid shopping experience is not going to go away,"" West said.

He said shoppers expect stellar customer service and short wait times in line while shopping in stores, and they also want quick pickup service and convenient delivery options. West believes retailers who have yet to make structural changes to backroom staffing will do so this year, impacting labor and staffing shortages. He said customer experience will also be affected as more retailers move to self-check while reallocating employees to pickup and delivery.

He said that increasing minimum wage rates means the fast food industry is moving to kiosk ordering and payment, eliminating the need for designated cashiers. McDonald's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread have embraced this move. West said that while it can be frustrating for the customer who only wants to order a soft drink, this is how the industry moves.

Even small retail stores like Dollar General and Walmart convenience stores offer self-check options and a smaller human staff.

West said retailers can't fight how consumers want to shop and must meet the shoppers where they are. He said shoppers now play a more significant role in the retail experience as they check out and bag their purchases.

""We will start to notice in local Walmarts, Targets and Costcos an upgrade in technology to make way for a faster, easier, more reliable self-checkout experience,"" West said. ""One thing that retailers have not yet found is a perfect solution for the impact of theft at each self-checkout station. What will be the impact on the overall shopping experience, and will prices also start to reflect the impact of theft at retail.""

West said there may be no real solutions, only trade-offs for the most complex problems. He said shoppers will likely have longer waits, higher prices and still have to do more of the labor on their shopping trips in exchange for the convenience of pickup, delivery and online shopping.

Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. reports that while offering a compelling omnichannel experience used to be the bleeding edge of retail, it is now a requirement for survival. McKinsey reports that 63% of consumers expect omnichannel purchases to continue. McKinsey also warns that retailers must embrace omnichannel and try to find a way to pay for it. McKinsey said retailers must prioritize one business that serves customers in stores and online.

McKinsey spotlighted three models that retailers are tackling omnichannel. The models include a traditional commerce option focusing on personalization and an ecosystem model. McKinsey said retailers must decide which model provides the best chance to drive long-term value.

""At the most basic level, the commerce option allows retailers to meet the minimum threshold for omnichannel performance. However, retailers with more advanced capabilities can take it to a different level. Best Buy, for instance, has burnished the in-store experience with curated offerings that allow customers to explore smart-home technology solutions, which they pair with free in-home advisory services,"" McKinsey noted.

The Best Buy mobile app also allows customers to scan to shop from catalogs and curbside and offers the ability to buy online, pick up in-store and quickly add tech support service.

Walmart has also invested in its omnichannel offering with connected stores, AI-driven smart search online and numerous backend updates such as more fulfillment from stores that helped improve profitability by lowering e-commerce losses by 40% in the recent quarter. Walmart also shaved 20% of last-mile delivery costs using more in-store fulfillment.

McKinsey said retailers must also evoke personalization to improve consumer engagement across shopping modes. McKinsey highlights beauty specialty retailer Sephora's ability to message customers with push notifications and book in-person beauty consultations with their phones.

Sephora store technology allows employees to access a customer's favorite items and suggest new products that align with their profile. Customers can use scanners to match products to their hair color and skin type. Sephora's loyalty program taps unified customer data and links offers across email, web, and mobile to drive online and in-store purchases. By achieving this level of personalization, Sephora can capture greater value from its rich customer data. Sephora reports that customers who visit the retailer's website within 24 hours of entering the store are three times more likely to purchase at an average of 13% higher than other customers.

McKinsey said another way retailers can delve into omnichannel is to build or join an ecosystem that allows customers to participate in community-based interactions that are extensions of the brand. McKinsey highlights Nike, which uses Run Club apps to foster in-person meet-ups, running groups and events for customers. Nike also offers a training club app that delivers individual workouts and multiweek fitness programs.

McKinsey said Nike's investments in the ecosystem model allow the brand to create experiences far beyond their show and apparel lines to fold the brand into an individual's day-to-day routines.",talkbusiness.net,news,Talk Business & Politics,Kim Souza,0.05882352941176472,448987159,1,https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/webhed_SupplySide-Firebend.jpg,

These days, when someone is looking for a fresh start or outlook on life, they say they're entering a new, specific era.

If you've been scrolling on TikTok or social media lately, you may have seen some young women posting about how they're entering their 'dark feminine era.'

A dark feminine era means not only embracing your femininity but female empowerment. It's an era that encourages rebirth and claiming your inner power. Entering your dark feminine era is a chance for you to feel your most powerful and confident while still keeping in touch with your feminine energy.

If you think you're ready to enter it or have already started, here are some signs that you've entered your dark feminine era.

You're done people-pleasing

It's nearly impossible to tap into your power and independence when you spend much of your time focusing on others and giving them what they want. Now is the time to ask, ""What about me?""

It's time to stop people pleasing your way through life and focus on what you want most out of life.

You embrace all of your emotions

Part of entering your dark feminine era means abandoning the idea that you have to suppress your darker emotions and ""grin and bear"" your way through life and its challenges.

The 150-megawatt plant, part of the Noor Ouarzazate solar complex, will be forced to remain idle until November 2024, the company said on the website of the Saudi Stock exchange.

The breakdown highlights the recurrence of technical issues and storage breakdowns at the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant. Technical problems stopped all output there for a year from summer 2021, two sources told Reuters last month.

The company said it will repair the storage issue and was also mulling building a new storage tank.

In a 2020 report, Morocco's economic, social, and environmental council recommended abandoning CSP altogether due to its high cost compared to photovoltaic and wind energy.

Morocco aims for renewables to represent 52% of installed capacity by 2030 from 37.6% now, mostly through investments in solar and wind plants.

It is already falling behind on solar, with only 831 megawatts (MW) installed so far, compared to the 2,000 MW that was planned for by 2020. Wind has made up some of the shortfall but polluting coal plants still make up most output.

Watermelon cultivated in districts such as Tiruvannamalai, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Kacheepuram, and Villupuram are sold to Salem market. The market at Shevapet determines the price of the fruit. It is sold to other western districts and the neighbouring state of Kerala.

S. Umar Ali, a wholesale trader at Shevapet, said that the yield was better this year. In view of Ramzan festival, the demand for watermelon is high in Kerala. Almost 300 watermelon-laden lorries (over 400 tonnes) move to various parts of Kerala from Salem. Usually the fruits will be sent to Kerala from Salem. However, this year, the fruits are also sent directly to Kerala from the place of cultivation. As the demand has increased in the wholesale market, the fruit is sold for ₹ 20 a kg this year, compared with ₹ 15 to ₹ 16 per kg last year. In the retail market, the fruit is sold at ₹ 25 per kg, Mr. Umar Ali added.

R. Mariappan, who runs a fruit shop on Yercaud Main Road, said as the price of watermelon has increased, the traders were selling at piece rates. A piece of the fruit is sold for ₹20. The season will continue for three more months, he said.

Representatives of civil society, child rights organizations, human rights commissions, legal experts, journalists, and political parties gathered outside the National Press Club in Islamabad on Sunday to demand swift intervention to ensure the recovery and safety of the abducted child.

The situation escalated when a video surfaced from an undisclosed location in Mansehra, purportedly showing Falak claiming to have been married to a 17-year-old boy in a court in Haripur. This revelation has brought to light serious concerns regarding child marriage, a violation of both legal and ethical standards.

The protesters and speakers emphasized the urgent need for a thorough and transparent investigation to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Particular scrutiny has been placed on the role of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Rights Commission, given that the unlawful marriage took place within its jurisdiction.

The protesters and speakers raised questions regarding the commission's response and its obligations in such cases.

Civil society organizations underscored the vulnerability of the child and stressed the importance of the swift recovery of the girl to protect her from further harm and exploitation.

The speakers emphatically demanded immediate recovery of the child and her presentation before a court of law. They stressed the importance of utilizing authentic medical and legal methods to accurately determine the child's age.

Additionally, they called for thorough investigations into the conduct of the Nikah reader, registrar, and the doctor responsible for issuing the age certificate. Transparency was urged in investigating serious allegations against certain police officials, ensuring accountability.

Describing the situation as a grave instance of child abduction, internal trafficking, forced early marriage, and child sexual abuse, speakers highlighted the urgent need for action, and raised their voiced over the apparent ineffectiveness of Gilgit-Baltistan police in recovering the abducted child, despite the passage of 54 days since the incident was reported.

They said that the victim's father has lamented the delays in registering the FIR and has leveled serious allegations against certain police officials.

While a FIR was lodged on January 20, 2024, at Danyore Police Station in Gilgit, the lack of tangible progress in the case has fueled frustration and discontent among the protesters.

The protesters also issued a stark warning, expressing that if the relevant departments fail to intervene and address the situation promptly, it could escalate into widespread unrest among the masses. They underscored their unwavering commitment to persist in their struggle until justice is unequivocally delivered to the victim's family.",suchtv.pk,news,SUCH TV,,-0.07450980392156858,448986010,1,https://www.suchtv.pk/media/k2/items/cache/3fa178fdcf51cb6b63eb38bcb17d535a_XL.jpg,

The damage is primarily in Maine's southern counties. Central Maine Power had 184,095 households without power, including nearly half of Cumberland County at 87,302 and more than a third of York at 46,281. Sagadahoc had 15,766 and Lincoln had 13,405 as of 10 a.m. Sunday.

Nearly half of Waldo County, 11,925, awoke to no power as well. Knox County had 4,412 and Hancock had 4,572 reported outages.

CMP's outages represent nearly a quarter of its customers, but the company was making some progress by 10 a.m.

The power company focused on the more than 250 requests from emergency management agencies to make downed power lines safe and other calls that needed immediate attention, but the road and working conditions were dangerous Saturday night, according to Jon Breed, spokesperson for CMP.

He said it would take the company several days to restore power in the hardest hit areas of the state.

""Damage to trees, poles, and wires was significant overnight on Saturday, and our assessors are taking stock of the damage (Sunday) so we can begin restoring power to our customers as quickly and as safely as possible,"" Breed said.

The company had staged 150 line crews before the storm and expected another 200 crews to arrive Sunday to help them.

Versant's territory was not hit as hard, with only 15,487 customers of its 166,195 total without power Sunday. Most of the outages were the 13,597 in Hancock County that Versant reported at 10 a.m. There were 1,564 in Penobscot, 318 in Washington and eight in Aroostook as well.

Many roads are still covered with snow and ice, and secondary roads could have downed trees and wires. Authorities were advising people to be careful if they had to go out or if they planned to attend Maine Maple Sunday events.

The National Weather Service centers in Gray and Caribou reported that Greenville in Piscataquis County had the highest snow total at 15 inches, followed closely by Bryant Pond in Oxford County at 14.5 inches. The least amount of snow was half an inch in Whiting.

Coastal towns tended to have lower snow accumulations at an average of 3 inches, although the Portland Jetport recorded 5 inches and Searsport 5.4. Western and central Maine got more snow than the coast, reporting anywhere from 6-9 inches.

Bangor reported varied depths in different parts of the city, but averaged 5 inches of snow and an inch of sleet.

Aroostook County had snow reports from one inch in Stockholm to 9.5 inches in Westfield. Presque Isle reported 7 inches, Caribou 5.5 and Houlton 5.

Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians.

The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia's climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas.

The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables.

But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues.

Australia's big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more.

In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans.

""This is due to nuclear energy's very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,"" a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO's gencost report.

The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%).

In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday.

Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold.

There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%).

The policy brief said ""emerging priorities"" included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change.

Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change's managing director of policy, said: ""Investors have given the government a pretty good report card.

""They're also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia's economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital.

""We must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt.

""Investors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.""

In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia's hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households.

In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year's budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia ""must be prepared to think big"" to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition.

Albanese said that ""every nation needs to decarbonise and electrify"" and this was ""a race that Australia can win"".

""No nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home - and power it in the world,"" he said. ""This is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy.

Nearly 200,000 customers across Maine are still without electricity after a powerful storm covered the state in about 20 inches of snow and ice on Saturday.

The early spring snowstorm brought down trees and powerlines in all 16 counties. As of Sunday morning, power was out for 184,153 Central Maine Power customers and 15,487 Versant Power customers.

Cumberland County was most impacted by the outages, with outages for 87,255 of CMP's 177,311 Cumberland County customers. Service was down for another 46,543 CMP customers in York County.

CMP said in a statement on social media that it had set crews in place for storm response ahead of Saturday, but that it still might take days before service is restored for all of its Maine customers.

""Road and working conditions were incredibly dangerous on Saturday evening, and our focus overnight was responding to more than 250 emergency calls and making downed powerlines safe,"" the company said. ""We anticipate a multi-day restoration effort in areas hardest hit by the storm, and we will provide customers with more information throughout the day.""

MOSCOW, March 24. /TASS/. The actions of Western countries in Ukraine are promoted by the desire to prevent Russia from becoming a great power, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with TASS General Director Andrey Kondrashov for the Belgrade documentary project.

Commenting on the common opinion in Belgrade that the war that is going on in Ukraine today began not in 2014, not after the coup, but in 1999, when the West stopped hiding all its aspirations for aggression, Lavrov noted that this absolutely coincides with Russian vision, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly outlined in his recent interviews.

""It all started when, after the disappearance of the Soviet Union - let's not once again talk about the causes [of the break-up] and lament - the Americans felt that the ""field"" was generally free, there were no sparring partners left on that side of the field and everyone had to be lined up in one row,"" the minister said.

""I am sure that if at that moment they did not think about the need to ""take away"" Serbia, Ukraine, but about how to prevent us from becoming a great power again and remain a regional Russian Federation with a huge number of American advisers in our economic, financial, banking structures - that's a fact,"" he added.

According to Lavrov, the hegemons tried to perpetuate their dominance by ""living at the expense of others.""

""The President [in the interview] uses figurative expressions. He talked about vampires, how they tried to rule the world and live at the expense of others. And they are still trying to maintain such neocolonial domination in somewhat ennobled forms,"" Lavrov went on.

""The United States left one of two largest, most powerful powers. They quickly began to embody all their ambitions and the luck that turned up into practical actions. Yugoslavia and Ukraine - they are from the same series as the subsequent adventures, the grossest aggressions in Iraq, Libya, Syria, absolutely without any international legal basis,"" the foreign minister said.

Lavrov also recalled that the United States came to Afghanistan with the ""sympathies"" of the UN Security Council after the attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.

""President Putin was the first to call US President George W. Bush and offered help and support. No one objected or called the entry of American coalition troops into Afghanistan an aggression or occupation. Everyone understood that such a terrorist attack must be held accountable. Twenty years of stay in Afghanistan showed that the Americans did not fight any kind of terrorism. They created structures and organizations there, which later resulted in Al-Qaeda (outlawed in Russia). Then they began to use it to punish and provoke undesirable regimes in the Middle East and other regions,"" Lavrov said.",tass.com,news,TASS,,0.1450980392156862,448985470,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,

Moscow. Several senior members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime have called for the country to bring back the death penalty following Friday's attack on a Moscow concert hall.

Critics have sounded the alarm over the demand, including due to Russia's broad use of counter-terrorism and anti-extremist laws to target Kremlin opponents and supporters of Ukraine.

Russia has had a moratorium on capital punishment since the 1990s but calls are growing in the Putin camp to lift it in the wake of the deadliest attack in the country for two decades.

""Now a lot of questions are being asked about the death penalty,"" Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the ruling United Russia party in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday.

""This topic will definitely be deeply, professionally and substantively worked out. A decision will be made that will meet the mood and expectations of our society,"" Vasilyev said in a video statement.

More than 130 people were killed when gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall concert hall on Friday, shooting spectators before setting the building on fire.

""It is necessary to bring back the death penalty when it comes to terrorism and murder,"" said Yury Afonin, deputy head of the State Duma's security committee, said on Saturday.

Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council, and Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin -- two close Putin allies -- also called for the ""terrorists"" to be ""destroyed"" following the attack.

""Terrorists only understand retaliatory terror ... death for death,"" Medvedev said on Friday in a post on Telegram.

The move was also backed by the heads of two other pro-Putin parties in Russia's parliament.

Critics have voiced alarm over the plans, including because of Russia's broad use of counter-terrorism and anti-extremist laws, which have been used to target Kremlin opponents and supporters of Ukraine.

Authorities opened a record 143 ""terror""-related criminal cases in 2023, according to the independent Mediazona news site -- up from fewer than 20 a year prior to 2018.

Earlier this month, Russia's financial monitoring watchdog added the ""international LGBT movement"" to its ""terrorists and extremists"" blacklist.

Alexei Navalny, Putin's most strident critic of the last decade, who died in an Arctic prison colony last month, was among those serving years in prison on ""extremism"" charges.

""If we allow the death penalty for terrorism, do you realise how many people the system would kill?"", women's rights campaigner Alyona Popova said Saturday on Telegram.

The ITV soap is currently dealing with the disappearance of teenager Lauren Bolton, with Roy Cropper in the frame.

Roy has become one of the police's top suspects after he was the last person to see Lauren before her disappearance, and was then subsequently seen with a shovel and bin bags.

While long-term Coronation Street fans know Roy is innocent and would never harm another person, DS Swain does not think the same.

The character - played by Vicky Myers - has become a permanent part of the show after a number of previous guest appearances during other crime-related stories.

But DS Swain has viewed Roy's eccentricities in a very different way to those who know him well, and her approach has not gone down well with viewers.

Taking to a Reddit forum, one wrote: ""How does DS Swain still have a job?""

They added: ""Every little nugget that she grabs onto goes nowhere. None of the people she is suspicious of never has any charges or anything major happen to them. Can she just go away now please?""

Another wrote: ""Surly Swain is useless and approaches everything with stupidity.

""But Roy, who is very intelligent and usually approaches every situation with careful thought and wisdom, is also suddenly completely stupid and out of character.""

A third commented: ""It used to be she was the one on the ball who seemed like she knew what she was doing but now she's a main character she has to start acting like she doesn't have a clue?""

Others were keen for the character to stay, with one writing: ""No she can't [leave], she is Queen.""

Another added: ""I quite fancy her. So she can stay for as long as she wants.""

The news of DS Swain becoming a regular character was revealed earlier this month.

The character was first introduced in 2021 when she arrived in Weatherfield to investigate the hate crimes attacks against Nina Lucas and Seb Franklin.

The ITV soap is currently dealing with the disappearance of teenager Lauren Bolton, with Roy Cropper in the frame.

Roy has become one of the police's top suspects after he was the last person to see Lauren before her disappearance, and was then subsequently seen with a shovel and bin bags.

While long-term Coronation Street fans know Roy is innocent and would never harm another person, DS Swain does not think the same.

The character - played by Vicky Myers - has become a permanent part of the show after a number of previous guest appearances during other crime-related stories.

But DS Swain has viewed Roy's eccentricities in a very different way to those who know him well, and her approach has not gone down well with viewers.

Taking to a Reddit forum, one wrote: ""How does DS Swain still have a job?""

They added: ""Every little nugget that she grabs onto goes nowhere. None of the people she is suspicious of never has any charges or anything major happen to them. Can she just go away now please?""

Another wrote: ""Surly Swain is useless and approaches everything with stupidity.

The 150-megawatt plant, part of the Noor Ouarzazate solar complex, will be forced to remain idle until November 2024, the company said on the website of the Saudi Stock exchange.

The breakdown highlights the recurrence of technical issues and storage breakdowns at the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant. Technical problems stopped all output there for a year from summer 2021, two sources told Reuters last month.

The company said it will repair the storage issue and was also mulling building a new storage tank.

In a 2020 report, Morocco's economic, social, and environmental council recommended abandoning CSP altogether due to its high cost compared to photovoltaic and wind energy.

Morocco aims for renewables to represent 52% of installed capacity by 2030 from 37.6% now, mostly through investments in solar and wind plants.

It is already falling behind on solar, with only 831 megawatts (MW) installed so far, compared to the 2,000MW that was planned for by 2020.

The classic 1968 film by Stanley Kubrick opens with a shot of both the moon and the Earth eclipsing the sun.

'Apocalypto'

Mel Gibson's 2006 film about ancient South American civilizations shows Mayan leaders taking advantage of a solar eclipse as a religious sign that their blood sacrifice has appeased an angry god.

'Dolores Claiborne'

The 1995 psychological thriller based on a Stephen King novel includes a housekeeper who confronts her alcoholic, abusive husband during a solar eclipse, causing him to fall into a well hole she has covered over.

'Little Shop of Horrors'

In the 1986 film adaptation of the musical ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" the villain, a carnivorous plant named Audrey II, is born as the result of a solar eclipse.

'Pitch Black'

The pulpy 2000 Vin Diesel action-sci-fi film centers on a group of people trapped on an alien planet, where they must evade underground predators who emerge during a solar eclipse.

'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'

This 1949 film, based on a Mark Twain story, features an early 20th-century American man who wakes up in Arthurian-era Britain and uses his knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse to his advantage.

In song

* ""Total Eclipse"" by Klaus Nomi: German baroque synth-pop about a solar eclipse? That's pretty much the perfect way to kick off our list of appropriate songs. Nomi recorded songs in a wide variety of genres, from classical opera to 1960s pop standards. There's no lack of weirdness on display here.

* ""Paint It, Black"" by the Rolling Stones: ""I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky/I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black."" So goes one of a great many Rolling Stones songs that tend toward the darker side of the human condition. If nothing else, it's a great metaphor for a solar eclipse.

* ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" by Bonnie Tyler: To be clear, the moon is not going to pass across the path of Bonnie Tyler's heart. That is not astronomically possible nor is it scientifically accurate. But the title alone earns this one a spot on the list.

* ""Eclipse"" by Pink Floyd: As the musical peak of the legendary 1974 ""Dark Side of the Moon"" record, the song wraps all of the album's reflective themes into a pounding waltz that crescendos with the line, ""Everything under the sun is in tune/But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.""

* ""Blinded by the Light"" by Bruce Springsteen: You probably thought Manfred Mann wrote this song. He didn't. Springsteen wrote it for his debut 1973 album, ""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."" Regardless, this is your reminder to not look directly at the eclipse without the proper glasses. Or, like Bruce at the end of the original, you'll be wailing, ""I was blinded!""

And since I know I'll get yelled at if I don't include the one everyone knows...

* ""Black Hole Sun"" by Soundgarden: I'll be honest, I was peer-pressured to include this song on the list. It makes no reference at all to an eclipse, but rather is Chris Cornell pleading for the sun to become a black hole and destroy the universe. I am including this under protest. Do not ask why ""Here Comes the Sun"" is not on this list. That song is about spring ... maybe about sunrise in general. No eclipse anywhere in sight. John Denver once wrote a song called ""Eclipse,"" which you'd think would be perfect for this list. But it's just about the sun going down at night.

* ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash: Again, we're really stretching things here, but for those not in the path of totality, ""ring of fire"" is a pretty apt description for what you may see as the moon passes across most, but not all, of the sun's face.

* ""Bad Moon Rising"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival: We're still on the fringes here, but you could make an argument that, depending on your level of scientific awareness, the moon blotting out the sun could be considered a ""bad moon rising."" We're pretty sure this song is about the apocalypse in general, but who's to say it won't start with a solar eclipse?

* Carly Simon, ""You're So Vain: ""You flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia/To see a total eclipse of the sun."" Luckily, in Western Pennsylvania, we only have to go as far as Erie.

* ""The Final Countdown"" by Europe: Only tangentially related to the eclipse, but hey, you know pretty much everyone in the path of totality is going to be counting down to when the full eclipse happens. So let's toss it in here for good measure.

* ""Eclipse Gallop"" by the Karl King Band: Let's go all the way back to 1919, shall we?

The Michelin guide awarded on March 18, 2024 62 stars to French restaurants, a class of 2024 rich in first honors, with 52 first stars, eight second stars and two triple-starred houses.

As director of the Michelin Guide for the past five years, Gwendal Poullennec has the power to make the most hardened kitchen masters tremble in their chef's hat.

Poullennec's motto, according to team members, is ""On the move"" -- which he applies to himself as much as the famous red guidebook he has helped spread around the world.

The 44-year-old walks fast and likes to burn off all the calories on his bike -- he has 14,000 km on its counter.

One bitter chef also remarked that he can spend as little as 30 seconds on the phone with those who lose one of the Michelin Guide's intensely coveted stars.

Poullennec's power can be measured by the great number of ""no comments"" that his name arouses when AFP asks for comment from people in the industry.

But that is the power of the Michelin Guide rather than the man himself, he insists.

""I'm just passing through, I'm here to ensure continuity,"" he told AFP.

Growing up between western France and the outskirts of Paris, Poullennec's family did not frequent a lot of restaurants.

But after studying business, he joined the Michelin group, hoping to be part of its gastronomic guide.

After a stint in the tyre factory, he got his wish.

The key trait you need, he says, is a ""good appetite"" and, as AFP witnessed over lunch in Paris, to enjoy finishing other people's dishes out of curiosity.

He recalled his first -- gargantuan -- meal after joining the guide's team. It was in Burgundy, the mecca of French gastronomy, where he was served an ""entire casserole of tripe"" and a ""salad bowl of chocolate mousse"".

- 'Simple and comprehensible' -

Poullennec's break came when he was sent to Japan in 2006 to launch the Michelin's Tokyo edition -- not a simple task in a country so protective of its codified culinary traditions.

As well as getting to eat ""sushi by the tonne"", he saw the edition become a big success.

""We sold half a million copies, more than Harry Potter!"" he said.

By 2018, he had worked his way up the ranks to be named director of the guide following the retirement of American Michael Ellis.

Poullennec has overseen a new era, including an inevitable shift to an online-first strategy, the acquisition of upstart young competitor Le Fooding, and the spread of the guide to new destinations around the world.

Before his trip to Japan, there were only 10, all in Europe. Today, there are 45 editions across several continents.

It is also expanding into hotels. One of Poullennec's first moves was to buy booking website Tablet, and in the next few weeks Michelin will launch its first hotel reviews (the best receiving keys instead of stars).

Father of five daughters, Poullennec likes cooking family meals and making his own bread. In restaurants, he looks for ""simple and comprehensible cuisine"" but ""with mastery"".

He refuses to name his favourite dish for fear of being served it ad nauseam, and he generally keeps quiet about his views on particular meals.

Inevitably, the job has made him some enemies.

Star chef Marc Veyrat tried to sue the guide in 2019 after a vehement dispute over a supposed touch of cheddar in his souffle (cheddar being considered far too cheap an ingredient for a respectable French chef) and the loss of his third star.

There was also an outcry when the Michelin downgraded some restaurants in 2021 at the height of the industry's nightmarish Covid-19 slump.

In order to remain respected by readers, such incidents are ""difficult but necessary,"" said Poullennec.

He knows many of France's top chefs personally, sometimes exchanging recipes with them, but insists he keeps a distance from them when it comes to the guide.

A recommendation from Michelin ""is based on talent, not on reputation, and even less on how influential they are,"" he concluded. -- AFP",omanobserver.om,news,Oman Observer,,0.0980392156862746,448985319,1,https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/600x600/2615680.jpg,

While many people talk about solar and wind power, there's a growing interest in nuclear energy as a vital part of the solution.

Michael Short, a nuclear science professor at MIT, believes that it's time to use every tool we have, including nuclear power, to fight climate change.

Nuclear reactors have been around for a while, but there's an exciting development in the works: reactors using molten salts.

These new designs could be safer and more efficient than traditional reactors.

However, there's a big problem: molten salt can cause metals to corrode, or wear away, which is bad news for the parts inside a reactor.

Short and his colleague Weiyue Zhou have been on a mission to solve this issue. They spent eight years figuring out if radiation, which is present inside reactors, makes the corrosion problem worse.

Surprisingly, their experiments showed that in some cases, radiation can actually slow down corrosion.

The journey to discovery

At the beginning of their research, Short and Zhou faced a big challenge.

They needed to create an experiment that could test how radiation and molten salt together affect metal corrosion.

This was tough because most labs only looked at these factors one at a time, not together. After many attempts and failures, Zhou came up with a new design that worked.

Their successful experiment involved using a special machine that shoots protons (a type of tiny particle) at a piece of metal sitting in molten salt.

This setup mimicked the conditions inside a nuclear reactor. What they found was groundbreaking: under the right conditions, radiation didn't make corrosion worse; it actually slowed it down.

How did they do it?

The researchers tested different metal alloys (mixtures of metals) to see how they reacted to the molten salt and radiation.

They discovered that the secret to slowing down corrosion was the type of alloy they used. Some alloys corroded more slowly when irradiated, which means they could last longer in the harsh conditions of a molten salt reactor.

This finding is crucial for the future of nuclear power. It means that by choosing the right materials, we can build nuclear reactors that are safer and last longer. This could help make nuclear energy a bigger part of our fight against climate change.

There's still a lot of work to be done. The team's results need to be tested and confirmed by other scientists.

However, Short and Zhou's research offers a beacon of hope. It provides a guideline for selecting materials for new nuclear reactors that could stand up to the challenging conditions inside.

Their work also shows the importance of not just focusing on one type of clean energy. To truly combat climate change, we need to explore all options, including nuclear power.

With innovative approaches like molten salt reactors, we might just have a stronger ally in our quest for a cleaner planet.",knowridge.com,news,Knowridge Science Report,,0.1294117647058823,448985298,12,https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Making-nuclear-power-safer-with-molten-salts-A-breakthrough-at-MIT.jpg,eng-9421756

What inspires you in your work?

Teaching is my passion. It's a profession that grants me the privilege of engaging with brilliant minds among both my students and colleagues. I firmly believe that a robust public school system forms the foundation of any thriving community. Transitioning from a teacher to an administrator has provided me with a profound perspective on McLean County and the remarkable possibilities that emerge when individuals unite in pursuit of a shared objective. As an educator, I have the opportunity to fulfill my mission of empowering and nurturing others to reach their fullest potential.

Tell us about your mentors or role models.

The guiding lights in my life have been my great-grandmother, grandmother and mother, who epitomized the essence of putting family first and leaving a lasting impact on their communities. In my professional journey, I've been fortunate to have mentors like Sally Tucker, former District 87 assistant superintendent, and Jane Compagna Reggio, my first professional female mentor at ISU, who both have offered invaluable guidance and insight. Additionally, my enduring book club of over 25 years serves as a joyful reminder to find pleasure in the pursuit of our goals.

Women's History Month: 6 women helping other women in McLean County

What do you think makes a good leader?

A commendable leader prioritizes both the organization's mission and the growth of the individuals carrying out the work. They excel in collaboration, attentive listening and providing encouragement. Leaders who exhibit negativity, criticism and condescension fail to inspire followership. Instead, effective leaders understand the necessity of pairing high expectations with ample support. They recognize the value in considering problems from diverse perspectives, knowing that this approach yields optimal outcomes.

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

Without a shadow of doubt, my most significant achievement is motherhood. Raising two daughters who embody independence, compassion, love and support fills me with immense pride. Regardless of the challenges I faced in my professional life, returning home to my husband, Ty, and my daughters never failed to elevate my day to greatness.

What is your hope for women 100 years from now?

I aspire for women and men alike to envision a world characterized by kindness and fairness, where open and honest expression of opinions thrives, free from mistrust or deceit. Additionally, my hope is for all individuals to experience reciprocal love from those they hold dear.

Julie Navickas

About Julie: Julie is a novel/book author; a communications professor at Illinois State University; and vice president of external communication with the Central Illinois Communication Association of Bloomington.

What words of wisdom do you have for young girls or women in today's world?

Find your voice. Words matter; they have meaning and hold power. I learned this too late in life. When I think about girls navigating the world today, I want them to know that their voice is just as important as anyone else in the room. In the classroom, I often share this message and hope that the example I set resonates. Write. Speak. Share stories. Because they matter.

What's still on your to-do list in life? What are your goals?

As a published author of contemporary romance, I'm proud of the success my stories have achieved so far. My latest release hit the top 100 romance novels on Amazon, earning me the title of best-selling author. But I have another (bigger!) goal. I'd like to make it on the USA Today best-sellers list. This list requires 6,000 purchases in the first week of a book's release. It's a big goal, but it's something I'm actively working toward and feel confident that one day I'll achieve it.

What do you think makes a good leader?

A good leader listens. They're transparent and willing to solicit feedback during times of change and transition. The best leaders (in my opinion) coach those around them to identify a strong resolution. A good leader is present and has a strong understanding of emotional intelligence. I've had many strong leaders in my life, and all of them have exemplified these qualities.

Who is a woman in history that you admire, and why?

Fran Walsh. She's a New Zealand-based screenwriter and film producer. Her contributions to ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" trilogies are often overlooked -- overshadowed even -- because of Peter Jackson's known name in cinema. As a female storyteller, she helped bring my favorite stories to life. I fell in love with J.R.R. Tolkien's lore as a child and to this day, still read and watch the epic films annually. I admire Fran for her contributions in a heavily dominated male industry.

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

I'm proud of my published novels. When I first started writing, it was intended as a creative outlet during the challenging days of the early COVID-19 pandemic. It grew to be much more, though! I'm proud of the stories I've written, but I'm also proud of overcoming the fear of sharing them with the world. It's difficult to put yourself out there. Thanks to Inkspell Publishing, the Trading Heartbeats and the Clumsy Little Hearts trilogies can be purchased everywhere books are sold -- and that means anyone can read and share their feedback, for better of worse.

Tracy Freeman

About Tracy: Tracy was a social studies teacher for over 30 years, retiring from Normal West High School. She's an instructional coach with the Illinois Civics Hub; works with students through the Town of Normal's Youth on a Mission program; mentors student teachers at Illinois State and Illinois Wesleyan universities; and is active in the Illinois Education Association, mentoring teachers in social studies education.

What inspires you in your work?

I am inspired by our youth and the future. I am so frustrated to hear people (adults) criticize an entire generation based on a few or what is on TV. We have amazing young people, and with them being taught civics and to have a dialogue, I have full faith that things can be handled! I am inspired to support opening doors and opportunities for future leaders.

What do you think makes a good leader?

I just heard historian Dorris Kearns Goodwin speak, and she summed it up well. She said qualities of a great leader are humility, empathy, resilience, accessibility, communicator, and ambition for something larger than yourself. I believe these qualities, and especially the ambition for something larger, are so important!

Women's History Month: 5 women who have built community in McLean County

Who is a woman in history that you admire, and why?

This is hard! Abigail Adams, Pauli Murray, Fannie Lou Hamer, Eleanor Roosevelt, and if I have to pick one -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She overcame many obstacles and stayed true to her beliefs, opening doors for others (ambition for something larger).

Quotes that sum up my admiration for her:

""Fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.""

""Women belong in all the places where decisions are being made.""

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

I am most proud that I was able to support students as they discovered their voice in the political process. I have seen conservative and liberal students (and in between) have civil dialogue on a variety of topics. They have found common ground and united in causes as well as agreed to respectfully disagree. They learn to value those who have chosen to serve in office while questioning their policies. They have learned to value local and state officials as much as national.

What can people do to support your efforts at work or in the community?

Support programs that keep our youth engaged. Teach them what they need to know to advocate for their beliefs (not what to believe). I have found a local youth program with the Town of Normal doing just that (Youth on a Mission) and am advocating to keep it funded! So many of these programs impact our future leaders and are on the chopping block of budget cuts.

Cameo Williams

About Cameo: Cameo is assistant principal at Pepper Ridge Elementary School in Bloomington.

What inspires you in your work?

The joy of connecting with children and witnessing their growth and happiness is what fuels my inspiration. There's not a day that goes by that you won't see me in the hallways loving on kids. Every moment spent nurturing their curiosity, offering guidance and sharing in their laughter reminds me of the profound impact we can have on shaping their futures. It's a privilege to be part of their journey, watching them learn, explore and develop into confident individuals filled with boundless potential. This connection with students ignites a passion within me that continually drives me forward and fills my heart with purpose.

As a Black administrator, I cherish the opportunity to serve as a mirror for students of color, reflecting their potential, resilience and worth. My presence in a leadership role not only provides representation but also empowers students to embrace their identities with pride and confidence. I am committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable environment where all students feel seen, heard and valued. By sharing my experiences, advocating for their needs and championing their success, I strive to inspire and uplift the next generation of leaders.

What words of wisdom do you have for young girls or women in today's world?

Run your own race. There are no timelines. Focus on your own journey, goals and progress without comparing yourself to others. It's about staying true to your path, pace and priorities regardless of what others are doing or achieving. This mindset is what keeps me grounded and reminds me that race is not given to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but to those who endure to the end. When life gets weary, remember to run on. One step forward brings you that much closer to your aspirations and dreams.

What's still on your to-do list in life? What are your goals?

On my to-do list is to become a building principal one day. My primary goal is to excel in my role as an assistant principal, striving to create a positive and supportive environment where students thrive and educators flourish. I am committed to fostering a culture of learning, collaboration and growth within our school community. While I am dedicated to my current position, I am also eager for the opportunity to step into a principal role when the time and opportunity present themselves. Until then, I will continue to hone my leadership skills, expand my knowledge and contribute wholeheartedly to the success of the school, preparing myself for the responsibilities and challenges that come with a principalship.

What is your hope for women 100 years from now?

My hope is that women will continue to remove all doubt and fear and remember to believe in themselves. I hope that they trust their instincts, capabilities and aspirations.

Second, my hope is that women will continue to empower each other by supporting, uplifting and advocating for fellow women in their endeavors. When women support each other, amazing things happen. There is room for us all at the table.

Third, never stop learning. Embrace knowledge and growth in all aspects of life.

Fourth, make self-care a priority: mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. Lastly, my hope is that women remember their worth. Remembering that they are valuable, capable and deserving of respect and equality.

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

My most significant achievement in life is the privilege of being a mother to my two wonderful children, Zaya and Jonah. Watching them grow, learn and flourish brings me immeasurable joy and fulfillment every single day. Being their parent has taught me patience, resilience and unconditional love. Guiding them through life's challenges, celebrating their milestones and cherishing every moment we share together are the greatest honors I could ever imagine. They are my greatest source of pride and my most cherished blessings, and I am endlessly grateful for the opportunity to be their mom.

Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians.

The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia's climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas.

The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables.

But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues.

Australia's big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more.

In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans.

""This is due to nuclear energy's very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,"" a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO's gencost report.

The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%).

In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday.

Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold.

There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%).

The policy brief said ""emerging priorities"" included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change.

Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change's managing director of policy, said: ""Investors have given the government a pretty good report card.

""They're also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia's economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital.

""We must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt.

""Investors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.""

In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia's hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households.

In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year's budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia ""must be prepared to think big"" to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition.

Albanese said that ""every nation needs to decarbonise and electrify"" and this was ""a race that Australia can win"".

""No nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home - and power it in the world,"" he said. ""This is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy.

Next up are the power forwards who defined the decade with numerous NBA champions, Finals MVPs, and MVPs making their presence known across the league's landscape. As the position began to evolve and advance, these 10 power forwards emerged as the ones who would define the era forever.

1. Anthony Davis

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 6x All-Star, 3x All-NBA Team Selection, 3x All-Defensive Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 23.7 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.4 SPG, 2.4 BPG

Although his lack of playoff success was glaring during the 2010s, Anthony Davis takes the No. 1 spot for his individual production and two-way prowess during the decade. Davis was drafted first overall by the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2012 NBA Draft, making his debut in the 2012-13 season. He would go on to finish second in Rookie of the Year voting with 13.5 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.2 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.

The very next year, Davis would break out as one of the best defensive players in the entire league. He earned his first All-Star appearance with 20.8 points, 10.0 rebounds, and a league-leading 2.8 blocks per game. The next five seasons would bring five more All-Star selections with Davis producing 26.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 1.4 steals, and 2.4 blocks per game on 51.7% shooting.

Davis' immediate impact on the Pelicans resulted in two trips to the playoffs including a second-round trip in 2018. While Davis has since moved on and won an NBA title, his time in New Orleans made him one of the franchise GOATs and the best NBA power forward of the 2010s.

2. Dirk Nowitzki

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 6x All-Star, 3x All-NBA Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 18.3 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.6 SPG, 0.6 BPG

When we think of the greatest versions of Dirk Nowitzki during his NBA career, we think of two separate times in his career. The first were his MVP days in the late 2000s but the other is his magical run to the 2011 NBA championship. Nowitzki's 2010s decade started how most of his career had gone to that point. In 2010, he finished as a top 10 MVP candidate but the Dallas Mavericks would fizzle out in the first round of the playoffs against the Spurs.

After yet another playoff elimination on his career resume, Nowitzki returned in 2011 with a vengeance. He led Dallas to a 57-25 record averaging 23.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game on 51/39/89 shooting splits. In the playoffs, he went into legend mode, eliminating the Thunder, two-time defending champion Lakers, and the Trail Blazers en route to their first NBA Finals appearance. Against the Miami Heat and their legendary Big 3, Nowitzki would lead the Mavericks to their first NBA title, claiming Finals MVP honors in one of the biggest playoff upsets ever.

The high of the NBA championship in 2011 was met with a subtle yet steady decline for Nowitzki through 2019, his 21st year in a Mavericks uniform. He averaged 16.6 points and 6.0 rebounds per game from 2012 through 2019, never to return to the NBA Finals.

3. Tim Duncan

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 3x All-NBA Team Selection, 3x All-Defensive Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 14.7 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 2.8 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.8 BPG

Tim Duncan is another legendary power forward who peaked during the 2000s but did more than enough to be considered top three during the 2010s. By the time the decade started, Duncan was already a four-time NBA champion, three-time Finals MVP, and two-time MVP. While most of his accolades were won during the 2010s, his impact on winning at a team level was far from finished.

In the early parts of the decade, Duncan remained a top two-way player in the league, averaging 16.2 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game from 2010 through 2013. He led the Spurs to back-to-back Finals appearances in 2013 and 2014 with his fifth NBA title coming in 2014 in a rout of the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.

Duncan would play through the 2016 season, finishing with four All-Star selections, three All-NBA Team selections, and three All-Defensive Team selections in the decade. Duncan retired in 2016 as the greatest power forward in NBA history and the third-greatest of the 2010s.

4. Blake Griffin

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x Rookie Of The Year, 6x All-Star, 5x All-NBA Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 21.9 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 4.5 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.5 BPG

One of the most exciting and electric players of the 2010s decade was power forward Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers and Detroit Pistons. Drafted first overall by the Clippers in 2009, Griffin would miss the entire 2010 season with a knee injury. When he finally hit the court in 2010-11, the anticipation was well worth the wait.

Griffin cruised to a Rookie of the Year win in 2011 with 22.5 points and 12.1 rebounds per game on 50.6% shooting. The Clippers brought in Chris Paul and drafted DeAndre Jordan, ushering in their most successful era as a franchise up to that point dubbed ""Lob City"". Unfortunately, even Griffin's elite play of 21.2 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 1.0 steals per game alongside MVP-caliber play from Paul was not enough to turn the Clippers into NBA champions.

In 2017-18, Griffin would be traded to the Detroit Pistons, bringing his time in Los Angeles to a disappointing end. In his first full season with the Pistons in 2019, Griffin would earn an All-Star and All-NBA Team selection with 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game on 46.2% shooting from the floor.

5. Kevin Love

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x NBA Champion, 1x Most Improved Player, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 19.3 PPG, 11.6 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Rounding out the top-five power forwards during the 2010s is the double-double machine, Kevin Love. Already a second-year power forward with the Minnesota Timberwolves by the time 2009-10 started, Love really came into his own as one of the premier power forwards in the game at the turn of the decade.

After a solid second season in 2010, Love turned things up a notch in 2011 with his first All-Star selection and Most Improved Player honors with 20.2 points and a league-leading 15.2 rebounds per game. Over the next three seasons with the Timberwolves, Love would average 25.1 points and 13.0 rebounds per game with two more All-Star selections and two All-NBA Team selections as well.

In 2014, Love was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers to join forces with Kyrie Irving and LeBron James. The Cavaliers would proceed to advance to the next four NBA Finals in a row, completing one of the greatest playoff upsets ever in 2016 when they came back from a 3-1 deficit to defeat the 73-9 Golden State Warriors. It was Love's first and only NBA title. Love finished out the decade with the Cavaliers with two more All-Star selections, averaging 17.1 points and 10.0 rebounds per game.

6. Draymond Green

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 3x NBA Champion, 1x Defensive Player Of The Year, 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA Team Selection, 5x All-Defensive Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 9.1 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 4.9 APG, 1.4 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Golden State Warriors power forward Draymond Green is no stranger to controversy on the court with ill-advised technical fouls and physical altercations. However, there is no denying the impact he has had over the years on the team as one of the key components of the dynasty they have built since the early 2010s.

Draymond Green is a leader on the court, sacrificing his stats to impact the game in ways that lead directly to NBA championships During the 2010s, Green's defensive instincts and ability to instill that knowledge in his teammates helped the Warriors reach five different NBA Finals and take home three NBA titles from 2015 through 2019.

Green was a Defensive Player of the Year in 2017 and a five-time All-Defensive Team selection during the 2010s. Aside from his defense, his patience and precision as a playmaker were also instrumental in their success at the team level.

7. Giannis Antetokounmpo

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x MVP, 1x Most Improved Player, 3x All-Star, 3x All-NBA Team Selection, 2x All-Defensive Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 18.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Giannis Antetokounmpo is unquestionably the best power forward in the NBA today as a two-time MVP, NBA champion, Finals MVP, and one of the most dominant all-around players in 2023-24. Giannis' rise to the top of the world began as the 15th overall pick to the Milwaukee Bucks in 2013.

Before our eyes, Giannis worked and worked on his game, developing a freakishly athletic build and game on the court. By 2017, Giannis was an All-Star for the first time and the NBA's Most Improved Player averaging 22.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.9 blocks per game. By 2019, Giannis would be the best player in the world, winning MVP for the first time and averaging 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 1.3 steals, and 1.5 blocks per game.

While his postseason success was still a couple of seasons away, Antetokounmpo did plenty to be considered a top-10 power forward of the decade.

8. Chris Bosh

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 2x NBA Champion, 7x All-Star

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 18.9 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.9 BPG

By the time the 2010s rolled around, Chris Bosh was already firmly established as a premier power forward with the Toronto Raptors in his seventh season of service. The 2010 season would be Bosh's last in Toronto as he headed into free agency for the very first time. After seven seasons North of the Border, Bosh elected to join LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami, forming an unstoppable Big 3.

From 2011 through 2014, Bosh helped the Heat reach four straight NBA finals while adjusting to going from a number-one option to a third option on the court. He averaged 17.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.0 blocks per game. His play and evolution as a stretch forward helped Miami capture back-to-back NBA championships in 2012 and 2013.

After James left following the 2014 season, Bosh would have two more All-Star seasons in Miami before misfortune struck. In 2016, Bosh was diagnosed with a blood clot disorder that would effectively end his NBA career abruptly.

9. Pau Gasol

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 3x All-NBA Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 15.4 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 3.2 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.5 BPG

At the start of the 2010s, Pau Gasol was on top of the world as an NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers. During the 2009-10 season, Gasol played a large role in helping the team go back-to-back as champions, averaging 18.3 points and 11.2 rebounds per game in the regular season and 19.6 points and 11.1 rebounds per game in the playoffs. Gasol would remain with the Lakers through the 2014 season, earning one more All-Star selection in 2011.

The next four seasons of his career would be spent with the Bulls and Spurs with Gasol averaging 14.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game. Gasol earned two more All-Star selections to give him a total of four for the 2010s. Gasol would retire following the 2018 season with the Spurs and Bucks.

10. LaMarcus Aldridge

2009-10 to 2018-19 Accolades: 7x All-Star, 5x All-NBA Team Selection

2009-10 to 2018-19 Stats: 20.8 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.1 BPG

LaMarcus Aldridge completes our top 10 of power forwards during the 2010s decade for his play with both the Portland Trail Blazers and San Antonio Spurs. When the 2010s began, Aldridge was in his fourth year with Portland, averaging 17.9 points and 8.0 rebounds per game. It wouldn't be until 2012 that Aldridge would earn his first All-Star selection, something he would do for the next seven seasons in a row.

With Portland during the 2010s, Aldridge averaged 21.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 1.0 blocks per game on 48.4% shooting with four appearances in the playoffs for Portland. In 2015, Aldridge would leave Portland in free agency for the San Antonio Spurs where he would finish out the decade with three more All-Star selections, averaging 20.0 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 1,2 blocks per game on 50.6% shooting.

""When he was on my shoulder, when I wrote the novel 'Erasure,' if I wasn't paying enough attention to him, he would march down my arm and peck at the keys,"" Everett said. ""So, I do credit him for having written some of the novel.""

Consider the irony (one of Everett's favorite literary devices) that ""Jim Crow"" helped him write a book about race - a novel-within-a novel satirizing publishing industry complicity in perpetuating stereotypes of Black America. ""Erasure,"" published in 2001, has been turned into the Oscar-winning film, ""American Fiction,"" starring Jeffrey Wright.

Another irony: The film he had nothing to do with (but likes) has given Percival Everett more visibility than the 30+ books he's written, or the fact that he's been shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and a finalist for a Pulitzer.

Everett's books are often perversely funny. Imagine a funny novel about lynching (""The Trees,"" from 2021), written in the form of a police procedural. Funny, until it isn't. ""Humor is interesting,"" he said, "" because if I can disarm a reader with humor, then I can address serious stuff.""

Everett's latest novel, ""James,"" is a re-telling of Mark Tain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" from the point-of-view of Huck's enslaved friend, Jim. In it, language is a running joke, but also dangerous.

The enslaved people, Jim in particular, speak in what would commonly be called standard English. But they slip into dialect when they're around White people.

""Papa, why do we have to learn this?""

""White folks expect us to sound a certain way, and it can only help if we don't disappoint them,"" I said. ""The only ones who suffer when they are made to feel inferior is us.""

In ""James,"" a man is lynched for stealing a pencil so Jim can write his story.

""In language, and in ownership of language, there resides great power, and resides an avenue to any kind of freedom that we're going to have,"" Everett said.

He uses words considered ""not politically correct,"" such as the N-word. ""'Cause I'm telling the truth,"" Everett said. ""You know, if somebody came in here right now and said, Hey you, N-word, am I gonna be less offended than if they use the word n*****? No. That focus on the word misses the point. I don't care about the word. I care about the intention. I care about the meaning. I'm not impressed with attempts to cover up anything.""

Everett, the son of a dentist, grew up in Columbia, South Carolina. He's from a long line of physicians - and says the only thing he knew growing up was that he didn't want to be a doctor.

Why? ""They had to be around people all the time!"" he explained.

He discovered he does like being around animals (""I've never had an animal lie to me!""). On the way to becoming a prolific writer, and a distinguished professor of writing at the University of Southern California, Everett trained horses, and even mules.

He is intensely private, protective of his home and family, and only shows up for book events when he has to. He would rather be fly-fishing. He ties his own ties. ""I like small streams, so I fish with very small flies,"" he said. ""It frees me to think.""

He also paints. A solo show, his fourth, opens in Los Angeles next month, his vocabulary as abstract as his writing is explicit.

He said, ""Working with stories is internal and sedentary. I love the physicality of making the paintings. I don't consider them differently. I consider them as things I do to explain to myself my place in the world.""

And where does race figure into Percival Everett's worldview, given that his books confront it? ""Do I think about race? No, but it's there. Sadness? Sure. Why not? What's had to be sadness. The reality, yeah, do I really care? No. I can't change this cultural tsunami that happened 400 years ago, and the waters of it are still waiting to recede.""

And writing his books doesn't take steps in that direction? ""One hopes!"" he laughed. ""I just do what I can, and move on.""",cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,,0.3254901960784313,448984994,1,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/23/cc5349de-04f2-4940-ab00-6de98d8069a5/thumbnail/1200x630/885fec708ff84f56103f36bba497cdf4/percival-everett-b-1280.jpg?v=4baa656f7af774a52a8c6a88476cb826,

But promotion back to the EFL, and the league title was secured with five games to spare as they beat Boreham Wood 3-0 on Saturday.

""We've used that day as fuel in the last couple of weeks,"" captain Jamie Grimes told BBC Radio Sheffield.

""For the players, the fans, everyone involved in the club, it was gutting. You saw everyone's reaction.

""I have to give credit to all the players and everyone here because they've dug so deep and made so many sacrifices from that time.""

Chesterfield finished third in the table last season, a distant 27 points behind champions Wrexham and 24 adrift of Notts County.

But in the winner-takes-all game at Wembley, they twice led Notts only to be beaten 3-2 in the shoot-out.

It was their third successive campaign to end in play-off disappointment, but that has never looked likely this season as they have dominated the division.

Nearest challengers Barnet are 21 points behind, while Grimes' second goal against Boreham Wood was the 100th in the league for Paul Cook's side.

There is still a month of the season to go, and although there is a desire to collect the five points they need to bring up a century, the Spireites already have half an eye on what awaits in League Two.

""There have been a lot of factors in our promotion,"" said assistant manager and former Chesterfield player Danny Webb.

""An experienced manager, good players, tremendous owners and infrastructure, good backroom staff and a hell of a lot of good supporters - it ticks all the boxes.

We survived the power sector financial crisis by the ingenuity of Mr. Dubik Mahama

The past four years of the energy sector have faced significant challenges, marked by a lack of clear direction and oversight.

This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply.

Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation.

Recognizing the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

While the Ministry of Energy's absence was a glaring gap, the empathy and resilience shown by the ECG's Managing Director is a demonstration of effective leadership, competence and has indeed saved the power sector.

Over the course of a 20-year pro boxing career, Tyson earned a reputation as one of the most fearsome knockout artists in combat sports history, regularly decimating his opposition in seconds and turning them into highlight-reel fodder. On July 20 in Arlington, Texas, ""Iron Mike"" returns to the ring to face Paul in a bout that will be broadcast to millions live on Netflix.

Details are still to come as far as the exact rules that Paul and Tyson will be competing under, but both men appear to be serious about wanting to score a knockout. In Paul's case, he wants to at least give Tyson the chance to be the first man to put him down for the count.

""I am biting off a lot,"" Paul said on his BS w/ Jake Paul podcast. ""This is definitely the toughest, most savage, lethal opponent regardless of age, because the power is the last thing to go. But the reaction and reception of it is insane. I almost can't even believe it, so very surreal and very, very grateful for all of that. We're going to see.

""I want to see how hard he hits. Mike, I really want to see, bro. Let's see all the legends, the myths, because you're Iron Mike Tyson, but I have an iron chin, people know that. I take shots. I think people are underestimating me being able to deal with his power, and that's something that's going to make it interesting.""

Paul, a YouTuber and social media influencer who has dedicated himself to boxing the past few years, is coming off of back-to-back first-round knockouts of Ryan Bourland and Andre August. He also holds wins over former UFC stars Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley, and Ben Askren and has rarely been hurt over the course of 10 pro bouts.

Is he nervous at all that Tyson could turn back the clock and unleash the beast?

""No, not at all,"" Paul said. ""I'm excited. I literally can't wait to look across the ring and see him and give him a f****** death stare.""

Paul and Tyson have already had the opportunity to stand face to face and despite Tyson still having the potential to knock him out, Paul could only chuckle at the absurdity of the situation he's found himself in.

""I just laughed,"" Paul said. ""I did the faceoff, and then I walked away and I just laughed to myself. I was like, 'Ha! This is insane.' On my screen, my eyeballs are the ones facing off against Mike Tyson, and I just couldn't believe it. The fact that it's on Netflix, I think that's going to really revolutionize the game in boxing. I think streaming could eventually be a very bright future for the sport, and it's just like a whole entertainment spectacle. Cowboys Stadium.

In laboratories around the globe, scientists are diligently researching the limitless potential of advanced therapeutic medicinal products (ATMPs). These groundbreaking therapies are changing the face of healthcare by harnessing the potential of the human body for healing. Using cells, proteins, antibodies, tissues and nucleic acids as ""living"" therapies is simultaneously promising, but also brings unique challenges from a manufacturing, supply chain, and patient treatment standpoint. The advent of ATMPs is a foundational milestone, the growth of which is comparable to the rise of the microprocessor in terms of its transformative potential for effecting change on humanity. The ""holy grail"" of ATMP-based treatments is to provide cures for some of the world's most debilitating disease states, but for this to occur, a unified front is needed to democratize these therapies - collaboration from industry, academia, supply chain and, indeed, clinicians and hospitals is paramount to ensuring safe manufacturing and transit.

The reasons for ATMPs garnering huge attention from the scientific community are well justified -- ATMPs are now starting to demonstrate curative potential, not just symptomatic treatment, for a litany of rare or intractable diseases. These therapies also come in various forms -- some can be classified as cell therapies, others as gene therapies, gene-modified cell therapies, nucleic acid drugs and other therapies including personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs), tissue engineered products, CRISPR-edited therapies and even radioligand therapies, among others. Still, despite their immense promise, additional research is needed before we fully understand and take advantage of the curative potential conferred by ATMPs.

ATMPs have a long history but were not considered treatments in their earliest forms. In the 1950s, the concept of a ""cell therapy"" did not exist. Rather, experiments were being conducted to treat radiation victims with bone marrow transplants, but failed due to an unknown reason that we now know to be an immune response-mediated rejection. In 1956, the first ever bone marrow transplant was performed, with surprising results - an identical twin was the key to a successful engraftment, which led soon to the discovery of human leukocyte antigens (HLA), and the understanding that therapies from biological sources needed to match the donor and recipient HLA-type. Around the same time, Canadian researchers Till and McCulloch were performing similar experiments in irradiated mice and found injected bone marrow produces small nodules in the spleen. Since then, an immense body of work has shown that these cells can in fact self-renew and differentiate into multiple lineages, which led to the term ""stem"" cells, alluding to their being the origin of all tissues in our body.

Today, we have reached new heights in our understanding of the complex signaling pathways and mechanisms of action that contribute to human disease. There are many milestones to speak of in the ATMP space, but most notable among them is a staggering 34,400 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have been delivered to patients as of October 2023. There are now 34 FDA-approved cell or gene therapies in the commercial pipeline, with hundreds more in development. Today, there are six commercially approved CAR-T therapies on the market, and in some countries and regions, they are reimbursed by government health authorities, enabling their use in larger patient populations. Thanks to key pioneers in the field of ATMPs, we can now confidently report that therapies like CAR-T cells are forming a new foundation for cancer treatment.

Of course, the story does not end here. Numerous other ATMPs are now being developed with greater potential for human treatment, such as allogeneic therapies, which can be delivered to an even larger patient population. These require larger bioreactors and healthy donor cell material but offer the promise of lower cost and wider accessibility. Similarly, a large body of work is being done to create therapies for the treatment of rare or orphan diseases. These include gene therapies based on adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are being developed for both prevalent and rare disease states, such as congenital blindness, sickle cell disease, hemophilia B, dystrophic epidermis bullosa, and even diabetes and spinal muscular atrophy. As examples of commercial successes in this area, Luxturna, Zolgensma, Lyfgenia, and Vyjuvek are approved gene therapies for some of these rarest indications. More recently, new non-viral methods of production are being explored to avoid speculation around the possibility of replication competency that could arise from the use of viral vectors during production.

For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics made history by gaining the first FDA approval for a CRISPR-based drug, exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy) for the treatment of sickle cell disease with vaso-occlusive crisis, coinciding with a record number of 14 review designations awarded by the FDA to CRISPR-based therapies in 2023, according to data and analytics firm GlobalData. In 2023, a record six orphan drug designations, four fast track designations, two regenerative medicine advance therapy designations, and a single rare pediatric disease designation were granted, and priority review was awarded to 10 different CRISPR drugs, representing a 55% increase from 2021 and 2022. These numbers indicate an increased priority and appetite for ATMPs by regulators and manufacturers.

At the end of 2023, there were more than 100 different approved gene, cell, and RNA therapies throughout the world, with over 3,700 more in development. Nucleic acid therapies gained infamy during the pandemic as a rapid and effective way to resolve a key global crisis through mRNA technology, but they also exposed weaknesses and revealed opportunities for new ATMP modalities. In more recent times, mRNA therapies are being used to create personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs), demonstrating their continued usefulness to larger patient populations with severe illnesses in a post-Covid world. Similarly, the advent of nuclear medicines, which has existed for decades, has brought a new contender to the sphere of radioligand therapy (RLT). This therapeutic modality is demonstrating efficacy for some of the most intractable solid tumor cancers, such as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

While the focus for ATMPs has been on treating cancers like B cell lymphomas and leukemias, as well as rare disease like hemophilia B and sickle cell disease, novel application areas are emerging, such as treatments for diabetes, Alzheimer's, and even cardiovascular disease.

With this excitement comes the realization there is still work to be done to understand the underlying biology behind these ATMPs. As an example, it was recently reported that a small proportion of patients having received CAR-T therapy had also developed secondary cancers in the form of T cell malignancies, which now requires a box label warning. There are also known side effects for CAR-T therapies, which include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Some patients, despite the high levels of response to the therapies broadly seen, do not survive their cancers in the end.

As the April 8 total solar eclipse draws near, sky gazers prepare for an astronomical display that promises not only a captivating display of darkness but also the potential for witnessing rare solar phenomena. For those fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, a brief period of darkness, known as totality, will offer a unique opportunity to observe the sun's corona without the need for solar eclipse glasses.

During totality, observers may catch a glimpse of dark-pink towers and loops of electrically charged plasma stretching into space, known as prominences. These awe-inspiring structures were vividly observed during the last total solar eclipse in Australia in 2023 and are expected to make a stunning appearance once again, given the sun's heightened activity during its 11-year solar cycle, known as solar maximum.

In addition to prominences, sky watchers may have the chance to witness other rare solar phenomena during totality. One such phenomenon is a coronal mass ejection (CME), which occurs when the sun ejects a massive amount of magnetic field and plasma mass from its corona. While the likelihood of observing a CME during totality is uncertain, astronomers remain hopeful for the possibility.

Another phenomenon to watch for is solar flares, powerful bursts of energy that emit various forms of radiation. Although rare, solar flares could potentially follow a CME and manifest as brief bursts of visible light and radio waves visible near the sun's surface.

Additionally, observers may witness eruptive prominences, massive solar structures that detach from the sun's surface and expand into the solar system. While these events are less common, they would provide a spectacular sight for those lucky enough to witness them.

Despite the brief duration of totality, efforts are underway to extend observation time and capture these rare solar events. Initiatives like the Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE 2024) project aim to document the eclipse's entirety, providing valuable insights into the sun's behavior during this rare event.",tech.hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times Tech,,0.2627450980392156,448984758,12,https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2024/03/24/1600x900/EU_1711205037810_1711287306573.webp,eng-9413446

This, he said, is following the project completion of the gravity feed water system that was delivered at a fraction of the cost through public-private partnerships.

With a budget allocation of RM800,000 from the Sarawak government, the water supply project was made possible with the help from the International Youth Centre (IYC) volunteers under the Youth and Sports Ministry, the Malaysian Humanitarian Movement (MHM) and the local community, he disclosed.

""In 2019, my prayers for my constituency were answered when our Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg approved the funds for the purchase of materials for the Long Puak pilot project in Ulu Baram,"" said Dennis when met in Long Watt near here today.

The Long Watt water pipeline and storage tank project was undertaken by the Miri Resident's office, Telang Usan community service centre, Kuala Lumpur International Youth Centre Foundation, Malaysian Humanitarian Movement Association, Humanitarian Development Foundation, and the Kampung Long Suling and Long Watt village security and development committees.

""The project was able to be delivered two months ahead of schedule, involving the installation a 3.5-km pipe and kinetic pumps and other engineering works.

Long Watt, a Kayan-Kenyah settlement in the Telang Usan constituency, is located four hours' drive from Miri.

The 100-door longhouse folks had over the years been pressing the authorities to replace the old rundown pipeline system.

""The project's implementation based on the 'gotong-royong' concept was mooted by IYC director Prof Dr Mohamed Maliki Mohd Rapile, a local from Kuala Tutoh here, and Malaysian Humanitarian Movement president Khairul Annuar Mansor in 2019,"" Dennis disclosed.

Maliki had presented the idea during a casual coffee session where he drew the project's concept on a piece of tissue paper, but Dennis himself was actually drawn to what the concept had to offer -from its free technical expertise to voluntary manpower.

""Funds were the main concern for these much-needed development projects in the rural areas,"" Dennis admitted.

""As a pilot project, if this is successful; we will deliver more of such water supply projects to Umah Akeh, SK St Pius in Long San and Long Sayan, with the Long Na'ah and Long Apu villages also in the list,"" he said.

Former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council, and Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin -- two close Putin allies -- also called for the ""terrorists"" to be ""destroyed"" following the attack.

""Terrorists only understand retaliatory terror ... death for death,"" Medvedev said on Friday in a post on Telegram.

The move was also backed by the heads of two other pro-Putin parties in Russia's parliament.

Their demand stems from a deep-seated concern regarding the unresolved issues within the chieftaincy system that have led to a stagnation of development in the area.

The call for suspension comes amidst a backdrop of frustration among the chiefs and residents regarding the perceived lack of development initiatives and the failure to address key concerns within the chieftaincy system. Weta, a peaceful community with a rich cultural heritage, has been grappling with these challenges for an extended period, leading many to feel disillusioned and left behind.

In a statement released, community leaders highlighted the pressing need to address the longstanding challenges that have hindered progress and prosperity in Weta. They emphasized that the inauguration of the Traditional Council should not proceed until these critical issues are effectively tackled.

Speaking on behalf of the chiefs and people of Weta, the Dusifiaga of the Weta Traditional area, Torgbui Ashiagbor iv, expressed the community's stance. He stated, ""We cannot afford to inaugurate a Traditional Council while our people continue to face obstacles to progress. Our community has been plagued by issues within the chieftaincy system that have hampered development initiatives and left our youth without adequate opportunities."" he spoke to News Ghana.

Among the primary concerns raised by the community are disputes about who occupies the paramount stool, conflicting interpretations of customary laws, and unresolved succession disputes within various chieftaincy lineages. These issues, according to the people, have not only led to a lack of clarity in governance but have also contributed to a climate of uncertainty and tension within the community.

The Dusifiaga noted that the disputes emanated from conflicting claims of legitimacy and the misrepresentation by the two chiefs who bear one with the same title ' Torgbui Akpor Ashiakpor VI.

He noted that the detail of the issue is that kingmakers of the Akpor stool installed a chief, and when they were in the process of outdoor him, a strange man surfaced, Nelson Believer Glago, and started parading himself as a chief with the same name, Torgbui Akpor Ashiakpor VI.

Torbui Ashigbor IV noted that the said issue cannot be detailed. The claim has been in serious contention at the Volta Regional House of Chiefs since 2008, but the veritable Torgbui Akpor Ashiakpor VI, having anticipated that justice delayed is justice denied and that the delay in the judicial process at the Regional House of Chiefs could cause havoc to his people, filed an interlocutory injunction to restrain the alleged impersonated from using his name Dusifiaga of the Weta Traditional area, Torgbui Ashiagbor iv, noted

Torgbui Ashiagbor IV noted that the Regional House of Chiefs has, however, ruled that both claimants be given an equal playing field to continue with their functions as chiefs until the final determination of the substantive case.

He noted that the above ruling had attracted criticism and fueled antagonism between the chiefs, resulting in a chaotic situation in the area. "" The truth remains that having two chiefs and the same black -stool is an abomination in our land"", the Dusifiaga of the Weta Traditional area, Torgbui Ashiagbor IV, noted.

Furthermore, residents have underscored the urgent need for infrastructural development, resolving the chieftaincy issues where two people bear the same stool name and improving access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. They argue that without addressing the root causes of these challenges, the inauguration of the Traditional Council would be merely symbolic rather than substantive in effecting positive change.

As Weta awaits a resolution to these pressing matters, the community remains hopeful that their voices will be heard, and concrete steps taken to pave the way for meaningful development and progress in the region.

For now, the fate of the inauguration of the Weta Traditional Council hangs in the balance, pending the resolution of the critical issues raised by the chiefs and residents.",newsghana.com.gh,news,News Ghana,,0.04313725490196085,448984431,1,https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/People-of-Weta-carrying-placards-protesting-against-Togbui-Akpo-Ashiakpor-640x288.jpg,

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect through Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, and a 91-mph wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain near the California-Nevada line. About a foot of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe.

A winter weather advisory was issued through Sunday night for parts of northern Arizona, the Grand Canyon and Flagstaff to the New Mexico border with up to a half-foot of snow possible at upper elevations and winds gusting to 40 mph.

In Maine, the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray, Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine, totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on roadways throughout the city.

The storm was blamed for hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at New York-area airports, and it also postponed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning. It comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

The Gun Owners of America, which has been around since 1976, has seen a spike in membership following the NRA's recent fall from grace.

The NRA was the most powerful gun rights group in the nation for decades but lost hundreds of thousands of members following allegations of fraud and abuse. To deal with the mass exodus, the organization also cut programs that were popular with its members, such as gun training, which led to more people leaving.

On top of that, the organization and its longtime head, Wayne LaPierre, were found liable by a Manhattan jury in a civil case earlier this year. Jurors agreed LaPierre had ""violated his statutory obligation to discharge the duties of his position in good faith"" and that his actions cost the organization $5.4 million.

""The NRA is little more than a shell of itself after hemorrhaging hundreds of millions in legal fees,"" Joshua Powell, a former top NRA official who settled with the state before the trial, told the New York Times.

There was a time when the NRA's blessing or opposition meant passage or defeat for gun legislation. The once-powerful lobbying group was both feared and revered in Washington and had been championing Second Amendment rights since 1871.

Between 2003 and 2013, the organization scored 230 legislative victories, including passing six state laws that forbid municipalities from limiting gun rights. Despite those wins, the NRA was unable to secure the expansion of concealed carry, as well as a change to laws restricting gun silencers when the GOP had full control of the House, Senate, and the White House in 2017 and 2018. As mass shootings piled up, public pressure on lawmakers to find a compromise grew, and the core members of the NRA started looking elsewhere for representation.

According to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government ethics watchdog, the NRA raised only $213 million in 2022. While that may seem like a lot, it marked a 52% drop in overall revenue for the organization.

Coupled with New York Attorney General Letitia James's huge win against LaPierre and NRA, the writing was on the wall that the once mighty organization was in trouble.

Despite its dwindling numbers, the NRA still carries some clout and attracts high-profile speakers to its events.

Last month, former President Donald Trump was the keynote speaker at the NRA Presidential Forum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was his eighth address to NRA members and one in which he again cast himself as ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.""

He added that if he wins the presidency in November, ""no one will lay a finger on your firearms.""

Trump first spoke at the NRA in 2015, and in 2016, he made a promise to ""never let NRA members down.""

GOA waiting in the wings

The GOA proudly pitches itself as the ""no compromise"" gun group and spent more than $3 million last year on lobbying efforts. It has capitalized on the NRA's financial and legal woes and emerged as a power player in politics.

""Obviously, there is going to be overlap, but what I think is unique about Gun Owners of America is that we are the 'no compromise' lobby group in D.C.,"" Erich Pratt, senior vice president for GOA, told the Washington Examiner. ""We have never supported gun control, not even so-called 'gun control-lite' like other groups have. Whether we are fighting in the courts or lobbying in the halls of Congress, we are opposing all limitations on our Second Amendment rights. I think that's what really makes us unique in this.""

Featured Local Savings

Pratt, a father of 11 who is on a church mission in Mexico, is acutely aware there is an appetite for gun control, especially in an election year, but said his organization refuses to budge.

In fact, there are at least a dozen people on staff who are actively monitoring comments lawmakers are making and actions they are taking. If they do not embrace the organization's hard-line approach to gun control, GOA may turn on them.

""There are millions of Americans who don't want compromise,"" Pratt said. ""I realize that that is always the politician's tug, to go that direction, but we hope to be that anchor that holds them to the Constitution, that holds them to their oath of office, and we will give them the grassroots support if they will do that. On the other hand, if they are going to go their own way and drift out to sea and support compromise, then they aren't going to get any help from us in getting reelected or elected to office.""

Like the NRA, the GOA has election guides for its members and grades lawmakers on their commitment to the Second Amendment.

""It's kind of a big production,"" Pratt said. ""We have a lot of people who are producing the survey, who are gathering the votes, who are putting all of these things together, reaching out to the candidates to make sure they answer our survey, etc. And if they don't, in some cases, we'll even put pressure on them and have the grassroots say, 'Hey, how come you're not answering the GOA survey? That's not a good indication. You call yourself a good Republican? Are you trying to hide something?'""

The GOA's no-compromise stance was underscored by its opposition to a compromise gun control bill in 2022. The measure was the first bipartisan gun control bill since 1994.

""The GOA was formed in the 1970s because they believed the NRA was too liberal,"" said Robert Spitzer, the author of several books on guns and a professor emeritus at SUNY Cortland in New York. ""True to its creed, the GOA has opposed every manner of gun law and attacked the NRA at every turn.""

Pratt said the goal of GOA is to grow its membership and dispel myths people have about gun rights groups.

""The biggest misconception is that they think guns are the problem, so they think we are kind of merchants of death who are fuel to gun crime,"" he said. ""Our counter to that is that we fight for Second Amendment rights because it is the amendment that protects all of our other rights.""

Pratt added that he is aware people ""tend to think Second Amendment groups are just for white males.""

To change that perception, GOA sponsors, along with other gun groups, hold an annual event in Detroit to help train women from the inner city on how to use firearms.

""It's all for free for them,"" Pratt said, adding that last year, 1,400 women were trained over the weekend.

The organization is also gearing up for its first national summit in August.

The Knoxville, Tennessee, event is expected to draw tens of thousands of attendees and will be held three months ahead of the 2024 presidential election, which Pratt called ""the most critical in history for Second Amendment rights.""

As key contributors to the national grid, he said, their instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation.

The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy, he stated.

""It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation,"" Mr Apetorgbor said in a statement.

Below is his full statement...

The past four years of the energy sector have faced significant challenges, marked by a lack of clear direction and oversight. This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply. Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation.

Recognizing the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

While the Ministry of Energy's absence was a glaring gap, the empathy and resilience shown by the ECG's Managing Director is a demonstration of effective leadership, competence and has indeed saved the power sector.

Making the revelation at the weekend, the body also stated that about 67 percent of Nigerian population does not have access to basic water supply.

Lamenting that about 79 percent waterworks in Nigeria were either non-functional or partially functional or completely moribund, the NIWE President noted that the research on WASH service in the country showed that Nigeria remains far from achieving the SDG 6 targets.

He called on state governments in the country, to grant full autonomy to State water supply agencies in order to attract investors to the sector.

He stressed that this will require adequate

legislation that will remove unnecessary interference in their operation and management.

We can learn lessons from the Swiss

The gothic cathedral of St Peter, perched on top of the walled citadel of Geneva's old town, is completely devoid of ornamentation. No candles or saintly statues, no plaques, paintings or elaborate stained glass, just austere grey walls. Only a prayer book adorns the simple altar, no bigger than a basic kitchen table.

This is the St Peter's of the Calvinists, their sober alternative to the pomp of Rome. Adjacent is the Musée de la Réforme, which documents the history of French and Swiss Protestantism, the 16th- and 17th-century civil wars, the massacres, the persecution, exile and ultimately survival of Calvinism, a religion surrounded on all sides by Catholicism.

The most fascinating exhibit was a tiny 17th-century Bible, so small it could be hidden in the trussed-up hair of Huguenot women. Dissenters risked torture and death if the book were to be discovered. The core of the Swiss-French ""reform"" was the Bible and the individual's direct relationship with God via the scripture, unmediated by the church, priests or the Vatican hierarchy. This emphasis on personal responsibility, without the need for layers of higher authority, made 16th-century Calvinism both revolutionary and incendiary.

Today Calvinism is on the wane in once-devout Switzerland, but its legacy is a reliance on the engaged individual - evident in the unique political system that has managed to keep this multilingual, multiethnic, multireligious confederation intact. Underpinning the Swiss system is direct democracy where local politics and politicians run local affairs, and the proximity of the people to power is the cornerstone, making the engaged citizen more accountable and more responsible.

Swiss governance boils down to the principle of subsidiarity. Anything that can be done at a lower political level should not be done at a higher level, and the balance of power in Switzerland is shared between the three Cs - the Confederation, the Cantons and the Communes.

The Confederation, or national parliament, handles issues of national importance and scale, such as defence, foreign policy, customs and monetary policy as well as nationwide legislation. Each of the country's 26 cantons determine regional budgets, taxes and healthcare. Lower down, the 2,131 communes determine local rates of taxation, planning regulations, and schools and welfare provisions. About 80 per cent of these communes employ direct democracy, whereby all residents are invited to cast votes in a communal assembly, giving everyone a say and a responsibility.

One result of this power structure is that in terms of people's everyday lives, the local communes have more power than the national Confederation. Power is inverted: local people make local decisions. Imagine trying to explain to a Swiss citizen an Irish Supreme Court judicial review procedure to determine the ""constitutionally legitimate"" height of a specific new building? What might they think of a system where the highest court in the land adjudicates in a local planning dispute?

On Wednesday, as I was strolling around the Musée de la Réforme, my phone started hopping. Leo Varadkar had resigned. With so much power resting in the hands of one individual, it's hardly surprising that this is big news. By evening, there were articles in the New York Times and the Financial Times noting his departure. Varadkar is world news. In contrast, few outside Switzerland even know the name of the Swiss prime minister - and that's the way they like it. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from the Swiss.

It is quite clear that the system Varadkar has sat atop is not working for many of the people in the country. We can't build hospitals on time, we can't build metros on budget, we can't build enough homes in the right places at the right price for the right people. We invoke the Constitution in rows between neighbours, critical Government development plans end up in the courts, mangled and disembowelled by spurious individual legal ""rights"", while the rest of the population suffers in traffic and delays.

As a result, we are a rich country that feels like a poor one and, despite private wealth, the public realm atrophies because everyone is in control and nobody is in control, leading to political apathy and, ultimately, the erosion of trust between the citizen and the State.

On top of this we have a form of ""spectator democracy"" where every four years we are asked to give the thumbs up or down to various politicians and parties. Once that decision is made, the vast majority of us pack up our political tent, sit on the sidelines and spectate, while the winners of the once-every-four-year beauty contest try to run everything - from determining what day is bin collection day and the salaries of talkshow hosts, to drumming up international support for Gaza, joining Nato or renegotiating the EU's terms on Brexit.

It's a big ask, and it should not be surprising that the system doesn't deliver. According to Einstein, a Swiss citizen, the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. If we stick to this political system despite the evidence of it not working, things will get worse.

Looking to the decades ahead, whether we like it or not our biggest challenge will be Northern Ireland. Demography doesn't lie and it is pointing in the direction of some form of reunification. To achieve this the political entity that is Ireland will have to change profoundly. One side cannot be seen to bully the other.

One way to reduce the possibility of sectarian strife is devolved government and fiscal federalism, where what can be done locally is done locally. The reason the Swiss devolved power in the 19th century was precisely to avoid a power struggle between German and French speakers, between Catholics and Calvinists. When power is local, the national - the flags and anthems - become less significant.

[ Happy now? Ireland becoming a more unhappy country, says global survey ]

If the 800,000 unionists who live on this island were to govern themselves in a new country, raise taxes from their own brethren and run their own local councils, while sending delegates to a national parliament for discussing foreign policy, then they would be more autonomous within the new Ireland. For the rest of us, exploring the Swiss model would make politics work better for all, because local people will determine local issues, pay more attention to detail and, naturally, we will feel like mandated participants rather than disgruntled observers. We will also be responsible for our own backyards, and won't have the excuse of pointing fingers at ""those fellas up there in Dublin"" or ""inside in the Dáil"".

What about finding our inner Calvinist when it comes to how we run the country? As I left the Musée de la Réforme, it struck me that the new Ireland could be well served by a dose of Protestant pragmatism, where power is delegated to the people, where centralised fiscal competence is entrusted to the counties, where politics is federalised to the provincial levels, and where the country is run from the bottom up rather than from the top down.

For the minority unionists, a federal Ireland would be the most Protestant political move since the Penal Laws. Surely there couldn't be a problem with a Calvinist Constitution ... It could even be called a Covenant.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,-0.09019607843137256,448983311,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/niBD3nDmyRiDifa_hl1vDS1b0Ko=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/UELRF4X3NEW66I5OGQDEUNDVDQ.jpg,

Intense rainfall on Friday afternoon and evening caused unusually large hailstorms, downed trees, fences, public boards, flash floods and downed power lines.

The National Electricity Union (UNE, in Spanish) reported that more than 260,000 users in the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, Mayabeque, Matanzas and Havana are without electricity service, particularly in four Havana municipalities where more than 120,000 homes are affected.

The UNE announced that crews of linemen and electricians from the center of the island, particularly from the provinces of Ciego de Avila and Villa Clara, are heading in solidarity to western areas to help their local colleagues repair the damage.

Metereology warned that on Saturday afternoon-evening an unusual cold front will arrive in the western region, with showers, rains and thunderstorms, a phenomenon that will move towards the central provinces and will weaken in the eastern region on Sunday 24.

The forecast center's warning specifies that in areas with thunderstorms, the strength of winds and the height of waves may increase, thus augmenting the risks of flash floods and sea surge.

In Friday's storm some wind gusts were reported, which were significant at 66 to 75 kilometers per hour.

Back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow as they had all winter, and the latest storm is expected to have longer-lasting impacts than the last.

The ""high-impact"" storm is expected to produce strong, gusty winds and widespread heavy snow over parts of the regions through early next week, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The snow and wind will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow as well as possible blizzard conditions Sunday into Monday.

""Disruptions to daily life"" are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday.

Blizzard warnings have been issued for parts of Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.

""Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,"" the National Weather Service in Goodland, Kansas, warned. ""If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.""

Heavy snow will spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Sunday, continuing into Tuesday. At least 8 inches of snow could cover northern Nebraska and central South Dakota to central Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.

Minneapolis could see up to 12 inches in some areas by Tuesday, rivaling the 11 inches it received over the entirety of the winter season.

Earlier this week, another storm dropped several inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes, beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning. But the storm this weekend will usher in more widespread and troublesome.

More than 300,000 customers were already without power across three states early Sunday, including more than 190,000 in Maine, more than 74,000 in New Hampshire and more than 78,000 in New York, according to poweroutage.us.

""We have more than 6,000 utility workers in the state working to restore power,"" said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a statement Saturday. ""While the worst of the storm is over and snow and ice should taper off as the evening continues, we are closely tracking 80,000 power outages statewide.""

The weather service warned the storm over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will bring strong winds and dump heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines.

Hazardous travel and road closures in the affected areas are expected into early next week. Wind gusts over 50 mph on Sunday could also result in difficult travel, property damage and power outages in the Central and Southern Plains, the weather service warned.

Heavy snow will continue through late Sunday morning over Northern New England. Meanwhile, flood watches on the East Coast are lingering over coastal New Jersey and Delaware.

Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms that could also produce strong wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes are forecast to develop Sunday from central Texas into Kansas. Severe thunderstorms will move into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday, according to the NWS.

The political slugfest between Congress and BJP leaders on BJP's candidate and cardiac surgeon C.N. Manjunath in the Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency is unlikely to end till the completion of the election. Apparently referring to the middle-class status of Dr. Manjunath, Magadi MLA H.C. Balakrishna said the BJP's ""white collar"" candidate was ""unfit for politics"" while Congress candidate D.K. Suresh knew every nook and corner of all the Assembly constituencies that come under the parliamentary seat.

In a counter, Rajarajeshwarinagar BJP MLA Munirathna lashed out at Mr. Balakrishna and said the ""white-collar"" candidate treated many patients and saved the lives of many people. He alleged that ""red-collar"" Mr. Suresh had ""looted the property"" of the poor people and done nothing for the development of the constituency. BJP leader C.P. Yogeshwar too joined in hitting back and said Mr. Suresh had lost confidence and was indulging in ""unwanted talk"". Earlier, Mr. Suresh took a dig at Dr. Manjunath for his electoral entry through the BJP and asked if the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's son-in-law realised that the JD(S) was ""not good enough"" for him to contest elections against the Congress.

Tryst with superstition

As the election campaign for the Lok Sabha election has begun, politicians have become more superstitious, even while venturing out from their residences. In one such situation, KPCC president and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar came to the party office on Queen's Road in Bengaluru late by more than half-an-hour for the event of four-time MLC Marithibbe Gowda joining the party.

Mr. Shivakumar, who often visits temples and offers prayers, said he left his residence after the ""rahu kala"" (inauspicious time) was over and apologised to the waiting journalists. It had a Domino effect and delayed the press conference by Chief Minister Siddaramiah, AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala and Mr. Shivakumar on electoral bonds.

Vladimir Putin's nuclear targets in the UK are not where most people think as fears of war with Russia escalate, says a defence expert.

The Russian leader and his propaganda machine have stoked up the threat of a nuclear conflict with the West since the start of the Ukraine invasion more than two years ago and the possibility is now widely seen as being at its greatest since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

Putin used his annual State of the Nation address to warn that Russia's nuclear capabilities are at a state of ""full readiness"". He stated: ""Strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness for guaranteed use. What we planned in the field of armaments, which I spoke about in my message in 2018, has all been done or this work is being completed.""

He continued to ramp up the anti-western rhetoric in the wake of ''winning' the presidential election in a poll widely criticised as a sham with anti-Putin candidates prevented from standing and the recent sudden death of main opposition leader Alexei Navalny in state custody.

In recent weeks the Russian Ministry of Defence said that it had successfully test-fired a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile, according to state news agency TASS. This weapon, which has been tried out before by Putin's troops on numerous occasions, is designed to be loaded with nuclear warheads.

But in the horrific scenario that the UK was hit by a nuclear weapon from Russia, then where would the likely target be? Professor John Strawson, from the University of East London, told The Mirror that while many people would think it is London, that is in fact probably the safest place.

Tension between the UK and Putin is running at all time highs

""An attack would likely be with missiles and a nuclear weapon would be used as a threat. From my experience with NATO in the past, the theory was that in a nuclear war then the Soviets would use low value targets first in a way to demoralise and that the capital would be needed to be kept intact as it would be where you would negotiate with the leaders,"" said the professor of Law, Policing and Justice.

""So Britain would target St Petersburg and not the capital Moscow so as to keep the capital functioning. Then in the UK strangely you would probably be safest of all in the centre of London.""

And then if London wasn't the target, large population bases in northern England and Scotland would be more likely such as Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow or Edinburgh. National Archive documents show Edward Heath's Government 50 years ago plotted 106 locations deemed to be ""probable nuclear targets"" - which did include London.

Military bases and radar stations are likely locations for a nuclear strike including in Lincolnshire and Norfolk. While in Scotland the UK's nuclear submarines have been based at Faslane Royal Navy base near the Firth of Clyde, which would be an obvious target.

Modern Russian warheads in current deployment are capable of striking practically anywhere in the UK. The Federation of American Scientists estimates Russia has 15 nuclear bases from which weapons could feasibly be launched towards the UK.

If Putin was to attack a country in the West, then the UK has often shown an ""anti-British stance, said Prof Strawson. He stated: ""Putin has got this anti British stance that can be seen in the way that he has tried to support former British colonies. He has been seen showing up to back countries like South Africa and other countries in Africa and this has worked in the way that some have sided with Russia or abstained in votes, while they have formed diplomatic alliances.""

But Prof Strawson feels that if an attack was to take place on a Western country like the UK then it is more likely to long drawn out warfare such as is happening in Ukraine currently. ""Modern warfare is about missile strikes to try and soften local resistance as it is so terrifying. It is what they have been trying to do in Ukraine,"" he said.

Russian bombers are being put through their paces along with missile silos

His take comes as British spies have added two more towns to make nine targets that Vladimir Putin would aim for if war breaks out with Russia. The up-to-date list - the most complete ever held by British intelligence services - was passed to a British intelligence officer in Eastern Europe by a Russian agent.

Intelligence sources have warned that the two further locations in southern England are now on the list for long-range Russian bombers. But while the names have not been given, the insider confirmed that one of the towns ""has military links"" and the other doesn't.

It is likely that towns with historical connections to the Armed Forces, such as Aldershot, Colchester and Portsmouth, are already on the list, other options range from Chatham, Kent to Tidworth and Salisbury in Wiltshire.",mirror.co.uk,news,Mirror,Tim Hanlon,-0.2549019607843137,448982994,1,https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32284495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Russian-President-Vladimir-Putin-attends-a-training-to-test-the-strategic-deterrence-forces-Moscow.jpg,eng-9416365

This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply.

Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardised not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), Dupik Mahama in the last hour of June 30, 2023, to save the situation.

Recognising the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

The breakdown highlights the recurrence of technical issues and storage breakdowns at the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant.

Saudi Arabian renewable energy utility ACWA Power International on Sunday reported a storage breakdown at one of the solar plants it operates in Morocco that will cost the company an estimated $47 million. The 150-megawatt plant, part of the Noor Ouarzazate solar complex, will be forced to remain idle until November 2024, the company said on the website of the Saudi Stock exchange.

The breakdown highlights the recurrence of technical issues and storage breakdowns at the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant. Technical problems stopped all output there for a year from summer 2021, two sources told Reuters last month. The company said it will repair the storage issue and was also mulling building a new storage tank.

In a 2020 report, Morocco's economic, social, and environmental council recommended abandoning CSP altogether due to its high cost compared to photovoltaic and wind energy.

The 150-megawatt plant, part of the Noor Ouarzazate solar complex, will be forced to remain idle until November 2024, the company said on the website of the Saudi Stock exchange.

The breakdown highlights the recurrence of technical issues and storage breakdowns at the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant. Technical problems stopped all output there for a year from summer 2021, two sources told Reuters last month.

The company said it will repair the storage issue and was also mulling building a new storage tank.

In a 2020 report, Morocco's economic, social, and environmental council recommended abandoning CSP altogether due to its high cost compared to photovoltaic and wind energy.

Source: Ministry of Energy of Ukraine

The morning missile attack by the terrorist country of Russia on March 24 did not significantly affect the operation of the power system. At the same time, UAVs attacked power facilities in Dnipropetrovs'k region.

In turn, Kharkiv is experiencing grid restrictions, Ukrenergo's press service reports. In Odesa and Khmelnytsky regions, blackouts are possible as consumption increases.

Debris damaged some equipment at one of the substations and a high-voltage power line. At the same time, Kryvyi Rih experienced interruptions in heat supply and disruptions in production processes at some industrial enterprises.

Also, during the airborne alarm, the overhead line that ensures the operation of the backup power supply circuit of Zaporizhzhia NPP was shut down.

In Dnipropetrovska oblast, Ukrenergo and regional power distribution companies restored power supply to industry and heat supply to household consumers. The power supply to Zaporizhzhya NPP has also been restored - the line that was out of service has been brought back online. Emergency repair works are ongoing 24/7 in all affected regions.

What is the situation in the regions of Ukraine? According to the press service of the Ministry of Energy, the situation in the regions is as follows:

As a result of the nighttime enemy attack, 3.6 thousand metering points were de-energized, and as of the morning, 600 subscribers are without power.

Power engineers have reconnected 11.5 thousand metering points that were de-energized as a result of hostilities. More than 42 thousand households in 76 settlements remain without power supply.

Power engineers have restored electricity supply to 1.7 thousand customers who lost power due to technological disruptions. The power supply has also been reconnected to 850 customers who were cut off as a result of hostilities. 3.9 thousand metering points in 52 settlements remain without electricity.

The shelling damaged a 10 kV overhead line and cut off power to 1.4 thousand customers in two settlements.

Due to technical problems, 56 metering points were disconnected.

A 35 kV line was cut off due to an enemy attack, which resulted in the shutdown of the substation that supplies power to the facility. The consequences are being investigated.

Network restrictions were lifted for 28 thousand subscribers. Due to technological disruptions, 57 thousand subscribers were cut off, and as of the morning, all of them have been reconnected.

Due to the hostilities, 242 subscribers were cut off from power supply, leaving 7.5 thousand metering points in 76 settlements in the region without electricity.

Almost 16,000 customers in four communities lost power as a result of night shelling. In the regional center, there are scheduled network restrictions for 200 thousand metering points.

In Kherson, about 3 thousand subscribers are disconnected, and almost 26 thousand households in 45 settlements are without power in the region.

As a result of hostilities, 1.4 thousand metering points in 24 settlements are without electricity supply.

Western nations may be getting ahead of themselves in their ambition to swiftly roll out new nuclear power capacity in the current push to reduce dependence on Russian uranium and meet net-zero targets with more nuclear-generated electricity.

At the COP28 climate summit at the end of last year, the United States and 21 other countries pledged to triple nuclear energy capacities by 2050, saying that incorporating more nuclear power in their energy mix is critical for achieving their net zero goals in the coming decades.

The United States, alongside Britain, France, Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Ghana, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), among others, signed the declaration at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai.

""The Declaration recognizes the key role of nuclear energy in achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and keeping the 1.5-degree Celsius goal within reach,"" the U.S. Department of State said.

John Kerry, President Joe Biden's climate envoy, says there are ""trillions of dollars"" available that could be used for investment in nuclear energy.

""We are not making the argument to anybody that this is absolutely going to be the sweeping alternative to every other energy source -- no, that's not what brings us here. But you can't get to net-zero 2050 without some nuclear power,"" he told reporters at the time.

Most Western governments - with the notable exception of Germany - are now betting on nuclear power to help them with the carbon emission targets.

But many may have become too optimistic they would see a fast rollout of nuclear reactors and capacities in an industry notoriously known for years of delays and huge cost overruns.

""Clients, governments and ourselves as the industry players . . . we all become too optimistic,"" Ian Edwards, chief executive of Canada's engineering giant AtkinsRéalis, told the Financial Times.

""We have this optimism bias towards being able to deliver faster.""Related: Big Oil Grows Bolder in Transition Pushback

The stakeholders need to plan better and get the execution phase done right, according to the executive of the company, which manufactures the CANDU reactor, the only nuclear reactor that doesn't need enriched uranium.

The CANDU technology stands for Canada deuterium uranium because it uses deuterium oxide, or heavy water, as a moderator and coolant and uses natural - not enriched - uranium as a fuel.

The West has seen in recent years several cautionary tales of huge delays and cost overruns in looking to boost nuclear capacity. Two of the glaring examples are the UK's Hinkley Point C project by French energy giant EDF and the Vogtle nuclear power plant in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Early this year, EDF pushed back - again - the probable operational start at Hinkley Point C to 2029-2031, depending on various scenarios, compared to the original intention to have the first unit at the plan running in 2025. The costs have gone through the roof - to an estimated $43.5 billion (£34 billion), from $23 billion (£18 billion) budgeted initially.

In Georgia, a new reactor at the Vogtle nuclear power plant began commercial operation last summer in what was the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since 2016. Construction at the two new reactor sites at Vogtle began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion.

AtkinsRéalis, whose natural-uranium reactor design differentiates it from the competition, has a sales pitch advantage because of the Russian dominance in enriched uranium supply, Edwards told FT.

But he warned that demand for AtkinsRéalis's technology is likely to exceed the company's capacity to meet it.

Last year, AtkinsRéalis's revenues from its nuclear division rose by 16.5% compared to 2022, thanks to higher sales volumes from Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Despite the West's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russian uranium, the EU doubled its imports of Russian nuclear fuel last year, mostly due to former Soviet bloc countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia importing Russian fuel for their Soviet-era nuclear plants, NGO Bellona said in an analysis last week, citing data from Eurostat and the UN's international trade service Comtrade.

The United States is doubling down on its own supply of nuclear fuel and technology, including innovative reactor designs.

Soaring uranium prices and a supply squeeze on the global uranium market have prompted U.S. uranium producers to revive abandoned mines that haven't been operational in more than a decade.

Early this year, Uranium Energy Corp said it would restart uranium production at its fully permitted site in Wyoming as the resurgence in nuclear power has led to a new bull market in uranium.

""Uranium market fundamentals are the best the industry has witnessed,"" Uranium Energy president and CEO Amir Adnani said in January.

The U.S. is also backing advanced nuclear technology and small-scale reactors, hyped to be the future of nuclear energy.

This week, TerraPower, a company working on small-scale nuclear reactor development backed by Bill Gates, said it would begin construction on its next-generation nuclear reactor in the United States as soon as June.

TerraPower has been developing the Natrium technology for advanced reactors, which features a sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The Natrium demonstration plant will be built near a retiring coal facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming.",zerohedge.com,news,Zero Hedge,,0.2941176470588236,448982701,12,https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-03/2024-03-21_u4dy0xt5zu.jpg?h=2ab8cbd2&itok=WfWHsDJH,eng-9416365

This initiative aims to provide crucial training and technical assistance to various stakeholders involved in implementing laws designed to prevent individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others from accessing firearms.

Attorney General Merrick B. Garland expressed the importance of this resource, saying, ""The launch of the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center will provide our partners across the country with valuable resources to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.""

ERPO laws, akin to domestic violence protection orders, establish a civil process enabling law enforcement, family members (in most states), medical professionals, or other groups (in some states) to petition a court.

This petition can temporarily prohibit individuals at risk of harming themselves or others from purchasing and possessing firearms for the duration of the order.

The funding for this initiative stems from the Byrne State Crisis Intervention Program (SCIP), which received $238 million in 2023 under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

Additionally, $4 million was allocated to support training and technical assistance, with $2 million directed towards establishing the ERPO Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer emphasized the critical role of this Center in supporting law enforcement and communities to combat gun violence.

Mizer stated, ""In addition to other resources leveraged across the Justice Department, this Center will provide communities with new tools and technical assistance to help them implement effective crisis intervention strategies and reduce gun violence.""

The Center, in collaboration with the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), will assist states, local governments, law enforcement, prosecutors, attorneys, judges, clinicians, victim service providers, and behavioral health professionals in tailoring ERPO programs to suit local needs.

It will also facilitate the sharing of resources and promising practices within the field, ensuring that funding from Byrne SCIP is utilized effectively.

OJP Assistant Attorney General Amy L. Solomon underscored the Department's commitment to addressing the gun violence crisis, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts at all levels of government.

Solomon stated, ""We must use all of our resources and collaborate at the federal, state, and local levels to find innovative, evidence-based, and holistic solutions to help keep American communities safe.""

The newly launched website of the ERPO Resource Center will serve as a central hub for critical information, resources, and emerging practices in successful ERPO implementation.

With 21 states and the District of Columbia already enacting ERPO laws, the Center's comprehensive approach is poised to make significant strides in reducing firearm-related homicides and suicides while saving lives across the nation.",njtoday.news,news,NJTODAY.NET,,-0.3647058823529412,448982410,1,https://njtoday.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Extreme-risk-protection-order-ERPO-1210x680-1.jpg,eng-9420443

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Florida has plenty of sun and a few incentives to make buying solar panels a bit easier. While it's not on CNET's list of the seven best states for solar incentives, Florida encourages solar panel installations in a couple of ways.

Florida legislates both sales tax and property tax exemptions for solar panels, continues to mandate net metering policies for excess solar generation and is one of only three states that offer property-assessed clean energy (PACE) loans for solar. Florida's state-based solar programs are also reinforced by a host of local and municipal-based incentives.

Some critics have challenged solar policies in Florida. The state legislature passed a law to end net metering but was rebuffed by the governor's veto. PACE loans have come under fire for their lack of transparency. It's more important than ever for Floridians to know what's going on with solar panel incentives in their state.

Depending on where you live in Florida, you can still get good money back for installing solar panels or a solar water heater. Learn everything you need to know about solar incentives in Florida.

Note: All of the solar incentives listed below are for residential electric customers in Florida. There are different solar incentives for businesses, schools and other organizations. The incentives are current as of March 22, 2024.

* Estimated value calculated by using a national average of $24,000 for installing solar panels and 0.98% for average Florida property tax

There aren't currently any state tax credits for solar panels in Florida right now, but there are other tax incentives and sources of financing for solar installations that are available to everyone in Florida.

Solar panels and other renewable energy investments like wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps are exempt from property tax assessments in Florida. That means that even if the value of your home increases from the installation of solar panels, you won't have to pay more in property taxes because of it.

The average property tax in Florida is 0.98%, according to AARP. There are lots of different ways to calculate the value of adding solar panels to a house but using a $24,000 average cost of installation, that property tax exemption will save Floridians who install solar panels about $235 per year.

Florida is only one of 13 states that offer sales and property tax exemptions for solar panels. A 2022 Florida law stipulates that solar panels and solar energy equipment are exempt from state sales tax.

Since Florida state sales tax is 6%, the exemption on solar panels and equipment will save homeowners $1,440 on an average $24,000 solar panel installation.

Florida is one of three states (along with California and Missouri) that allow property-assessed clean energy loans for solar panels. PACE loans allow homeowners to install solar panels with no upfront cost. Instead, a lien is placed on the property for the value of the solar panel installation, and homeowners pay off the money as a line item in their property tax bills. Terms for PACE loans are usually five to 20 years.

PACE loans don't require a credit check and are an easy way to make renewable energy improvements, but PACE programs in Florida have come under fire due to a lack of state oversight. Since PACE loans require a lien on the property, there's an additional risk of foreclosure for nonpayment. Some lenders -- particularly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- won't issue mortgages for properties with PACE liens, meaning you'd need to pay off the loan completely to sell your house.

The Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) encourages underserved communities to install solar panels by providing advantageous financing for solar installations. Borrowers get a fixed rate of 7.99% to 8.25% for loan amounts of $3,000 to $25,000 over terms of three to 10 years.

There is no minimum credit score or minimum income required to be eligible for a SELF loan, but you must be current on your property taxes and have paid your mortgage on time for at least the past 90 days. The program occasionally offers other rates, like a 10-year loan at 6.99% offered in early 2024.

There are only a few local rebates for solar panels in Florida right now. Most local rebates are for solar water heaters or attic fans. We'll continue to update this space as new solar incentives in Florida arise.

Boynton Beach is an Atlantic Coast city in Florida offering money back for solar investment. The city currently gives $1,500 back for installation of qualifying solar panel systems. The solar installation must have at least 5kW capacity and 17.5% efficiency to be eligible for the rebate.

Is it a grant or a rebate? Does it matter? Located to the west of Tampa on the Gulf Coast, the city of Dunedin gives residents and businesses money for installing solar systems. The rebate/grant is based on solar panel system capacity. Residents can get $0.25 per watt of solar power generated up to a maximum of $2,500. Yearly funds are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, and projects must be completed and permitted by Oct. 1 each year.

Florida might only have a few rebates for solar panels, but cities and local utilities offer rebates for solar water heaters, solar pool heaters and solar attic fans. Here are all the rebates for solar appliances that we were able to find in Florida.

Serving the beach cities east of Jacksonville, Florida, Beaches Energy gives its customers up to $1,250 back for energy-efficient upgrades, including $500 for the installation of a solar water heater.

Clay Electric Cooperative provides its customers with rebates for energy efficiency upgrades like foam insulation and heat pumps. Its rebate for solar water heaters is based on the capacity, paying $0.01 per output BTU for a maximum rebate of $600.

Located an hour north of West Palm Beach, publicly owned Fort Pierce Utilities provides customers with rebates for Energy Star appliances, insulation and other efficiency upgrades. Qualifying solar water heaters can get a $450 rebate.

Jacksonville-based JEA gives its residential customers a wide range of energy efficiency rebates, including $400 for those who convert from an electric water heater to solar.

Along with rebates for efficient refrigerators, ceiling fans and dishwashers, Keys Energy gives its residential customers $450 for solar water heaters.

South of Daytona Beach, the coastal utility of New Smyrna Beach only offers customers a few efficiency rebates, but one of them is for solar attic fans. Qualifying purchases can get 25% back of the installation cost, up to a maximum of $150.

Ocala Electric customers who make the switch from an electric water heater to solar are eligible for one of the utility's many efficiency rebates. Qualifying solar heaters can get $450 back.

OUC offers up to $900 back as an energy efficiency rebate for installing solar water heating. Customers must use one of OUC's ""preferred solar contractors"" to be eligible for the rebate, which doesn't include solar pool heating.

Along with special financing for solar water heaters (see below), Tallahassee also provides a rebate of $450 for switching from electric to solar. The rebate shows up as a credit on customers' electric bills.

For financing solar panels, Florida residents have several local loan options, along with the statewide PACE and SELF loans mentioned above. The following cities and local electrical providers offer special loans for solar panel installations or solar water heaters.

Clay Electric offers fixed-rate loans for 24 different energy-efficiency home improvements, including solar water heaters and solar pool heaters but not solar panel installations. Customers can borrow between $1,000 and $10,000 at rates of either 5% or 8%, depending on their credit rating. Loan terms depend on loan amounts, but the maximum repayment period is seven years.

Way down south in the Florida Keys, FKEC gives homeowners simple-interest loans of up to $35,000 for installing solar panels. The loan must be repaid within 10 years through monthly bill payments, and homeowners must have a 12-month clean billing history to qualify.

Lakeland Electric provides interest-free loans from $500 to $5,000 for renewable energy improvements including solar panels and solar water heaters to customers who have been in good standing for at least one year. The utility will place a lien on the property until the loan is repaid via monthly billing. The loan excludes the value of any tax credits or rebates on the solar panels, including the federal solar tax credit.

West of Fort Lauderdale, the city of Lauderhill offers interest-free loans of $400 to $2,500 for Energy Star appliances, as well as solar panel installations and solar water heaters. The loans must be paid back within two years. For solar panels, loan checks will be made payable directly to contractors.

Tallahassee Utilities provides 5% loans for 25 different energy-efficiency projects, including the installation of solar panels. You can get a maximum of $10,000 loan at a term of up to 10 years for solar panel projects that satisfy an energy audit. The city also provides loans for installing solar water heaters.

As with most other states, the biggest incentive for installing solar panels in Florida might be the federal solar tax credit, officially called the residential clean energy credit. It gives homeowners who install solar panels 30% of their cost back at tax time, a $7,200 value based on an average installation cost of $24,000.

There's no maximum to the credit although it is nonrefundable -- you can't receive more money than you owe in taxes. To claim the federal solar tax credit when you file your tax return, use IRS Form 5695 (or let the best tax software handle it for you).

Florida has required net metering programs for solar energy customers since 2008. Net metering is the practice of paying customers back for excess solar energy that is put back into the electrical grid.

The net metering law for Florida applies to the state's four major investor-owned utilities -- Duke Energy, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities and Tampa Electric Company. These companies must give customers credits for excess solar energy that are equal to their retail rates for electricity. Those credits can roll over monthly to pay future electric bills. At the end of the year, the utilities must pay customers for their unused credits based on an ""avoided cost"" rate that is lower than the retail rate.

Most regional and municipal electric utilities in Florida have net metering policies of their own, although they are not required to by law. Here is a collection of several local electric providers in Florida that provide net metering with links to their policies and rates.

The future of net metering in Florida remains uncertain. In 2022, state legislation to eliminate net metering passed both houses of the legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Florida does not have any laws requiring utilities to provide community solar programs to their customers. Community solar allows energy consumers to access solar power without installing solar panels on their homes. Instead, participants join solar projects that generate electricity for multiple homes using large-scale solar installations located elsewhere.

The following utilities provide solar programs that operate similarly to community solar projects. Some programs are currently full but offer waitlists for when spots become available:

The Florida Municipal Solar Project is a joint community solar effort between the Florida Municipal Power Agency and 16 public power companies across the state -- Alachua, Bartow, Fort Pierce, Havana, Homestead, Jacksonville Beach, Key West, Kissimmee, Lake Worth, Mount Dora, New Smyrna Beach, Newberry, Ocala, Orlando, Wauchula and Winter Park -- but only a few of those utilities currently offer community solar programs for their customers:",cnet.com,news,CNET,,0.3254901960784313,448982356,1,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/ae3db0bfeddc2e4bd8f1387fabf0cc413af252a5/hub/2023/06/23/a7d8ba0e-1652-4e33-9db8-1ffe376a7d1d/florida-residential-solar-panels-gettyimages-1308882367.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,

Wind warnings are in place for Lunenburg, Hants, and Kings Counties, as well as much of Cape Breton. Wind in those areas is expected to reach around 80 km/h, with some over-exposed areas reaching 100km/h.

Winds are expected to calm in those areas later Sunday morning, although some eastern sections seeing higher winds continue into the afternoon.

Much of Mainland Nova Scotia, including Halifax, Pictou, and Guysborough Counties, also has an additional rainfall warning with total amounts expected to reach 25 to 50 millimetres. Environment Canada also warns of the possibility of localized flooding in some low-lying areas.

The rain will end west to east Sunday morning into the afternoon.

Environment Canada does not have any weather alerts in place for New Brunswick or P.E.I., although the provinces are seeing a mix of rain and freezing rain with snow in some areas.

Crews were working early morning on Sunday to try and restore power to many areas of the Maritimes after wind and rain took many off the grid.

You'll need to steady your phone, so a tripod or another creative solution is required.

Your smartphone. To get as up-close a picture as possible, use your phone's telephoto (also known as zoom) camera if it has one. The iPhone 15 Pro, for instance, has a telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom -- which will provide the best visual quality -- and up to 15x digital zoom if you're okay with less crisp results. Samsung's Galaxy S Ultra phones offer between 3x and 10x optical zoom, but a built-in Space Zoom feature means you can push in as far as 100x.

If your phone doesn't have a telephoto camera, or if you want even more range, consider using a telephoto lens attachment. In general, these cost between $30 and $50, and if you are considering buying one, search for a lens that offers the most magnification possible.

A tripod. This can help in a few ways: It will keep your phone framed just right, reduce the possibility of a sneeze or a gust of wind messing up your photo, and keep you from having to look in the direction of the sun before the moon passes fully in front of it.

A solar filter. This will dramatically reduce the amount of light that enters your phone's camera and help to protect the precious sensor inside.

You won't need it during totality -- the money-shot moment when the moon is sitting directly in front of the sun -- but it's crucial for the moments before and after when the sun is only partially obscured.

A way to mount the filter. If you're using a small sheet and relying on your phone's built-in cameras, you can easily tape a filter in front of it or hold it in place. You could also use a filter adapter that fits in front of your phone's lenses that lets you screw in dedicated filters for non-phone cameras.

For the best results, you may also want to consider fitting a bit of black cloth around the filter to minimize the amount of external light that bleeds into your images.",washingtonpost.com,news,Washington Post,Chris Velazco,0.2470588235294118,448981909,1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MF7AJBLGTRBCBISYOISOJ5FF4E.jpg&w=1440,

The party's request was turned down in view of the ""law and order situation"". DC Memon stated that the party had already violated NOCs (no objection certificates) issued on earlier occasions.

Two days prior, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq instructed the capital's Deputy Commissioner to address the issue and submit a report accordingly, as per The Express Tribune.

The request for permission for a public gathering on either March 23 or 30, at Parade Ground, F9 Park, or D Chowk at 10 pm, was made by the regional president of the former ruling party, Amir Masood Mughal.

According to The Express Tribune, the secretary of interior, chief commissioner, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner, and SSP operations were addressed in the application.

It demanded the law enforcement agencies refrain from blocking the routes to the venue and abstain from arresting or baton-charging party supporters.

The PTI submitted formal written requests to the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner on March 15 and 18 to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but received no response until March 21.

Later, Imran's party approached the court after alleging that the district administration was unresponsive to their request, therefore, the court should issue directions in this regard.

The PTI also faced similar rejections earlier, as the Rawalpindi District Administration declined the party's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh on February 5, right before the crucial general elections.

District Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema rejected the PTI's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh, saying that it was not possible to allow the party to hold a rally in the city as it might affect the law and order situation.

In this article, we'll dive into what this means for the future of Bitcoin and introduce you to Galaxy Fox, a red-hot meme coin poised to be the best upcoming ICO of 2024.

For a while now, Grayscale has been the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to institutional investment in Bitcoin. Their GBTC trust has been a popular vehicle for big money to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. However, the tide seems to be turning. A record-breaking outflow of $326 million from GBTC on March 19th has sent shockwaves through the crypto community.

At this burn rate, Grayscale's Bitcoin reserves could be depleted by late July. This means that if outflows continue, there could be a significant decrease in the available supply of Bitcoin, potentially leading to a price surge.

Now, before you hop on the Batmobile and become Bitcoin Bruce Wayne, it's important to remember that this is just one piece of the puzzle. The broader market sentiment and adoption by mainstream institutions will ultimately dictate Bitcoin's future trajectory.

While the Bitcoin saga unfolds, let's shift gears and focus on a rising best upcoming ICO star in the altcoin arena - Galaxy Fox. This best cheap crypto to buy right now, with a catchy name and a 5-billion capped supply, is in the tenth and last stage of its presale, and many see it as one of the hottest investments of the year.

But what exactly makes Galaxy Fox such a compelling prospect? Here's a breakdown of the key factors fueling the hype:

The Galaxy Fox presale has been a resounding success, raising a staggering $5.2 million thus far. Almost 90% of the tokens for stage 10 have been snapped up by early adopters, which means there's still an opportunity to snag $GFOX at the lowest possible price before it blasts off to the moon post-launch.

The clock is ticking, and the presale is about to wrap up. If you're searching for an investment with the potential for explosive growth, Galaxy Fox is a serious contender for the best upcoming ICO.

It is always enlightening when the incompetent media tries to use propaganda and fails spectacularly. It's obvious that they never even consulted the official definition of the ""deep state"" -- a body of people, typically influential members of government agencies or the military, believed to be involved in the secret manipulation or control of government policy -- before writing a completely bogus piece.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

The NYT does not know it, but the NYT is dead. Go woke, go broke. You see, they can no longer report uncomfortable truths. With COVID, it became abundantly clear that the bureaucrats at the Federal Drug Administration were the ""deep state."" (Actually, that coterie of scientists and doctors at CDC, and the NIAID, are largely deep state too.) As government employees, they were supposed to share a common interest: perform work to protect Americans.

Before it became the deep state FDA, they worked to protect the national blood supply of America, ensuring blood products were free of contaminants, viruses, and infectious diseases. No longer. Now, the FDA is fully compromised and is actually facilitating the contamination of the national blood supply. (Maybe you read reports last year that the deep state FDA was finalizing new guidelines to remove certain safeguards in place to prevent HIV transmission in blood products.)

Before there was the deep state FDA, there was the ""dedicated to patient safety"" and ""do no harm"" FDA. With respect to the national blood supply, the old FDA reduced the risk of HIV transmission (and the chance of acquiring AIDS) into the nation's blood supply by preventing it from occurring. Period, full stop. Gay men were not allowed to give blood, and if they lied during the blood donating process, blood was still tested and destroyed as a biohazard if the hepatitis virus or HIV were detected.

Before they had been infected with the woke virus, the FDA could be counted on for professionalism, and to not play mind-numbingly stupid political games by allowing the contaminated blood from gay men to enter the national blood supply.

But now they did it.

Why is the deep state FDA trying to normalize gay men into society without regard to their risky behaviors? In my previous American Thinker article, Why are Children Coming down with Monkeypox?, the corrupt media, the deep state FDA, and their Democrat handlers sought to tamp down the ultimate question -- how do children come down with Monkeypox when Monkeypox in America is fueled by sex between men? Now the deep state FDA has succeeded in overturning the decades-long moratorium of gay men giving blood.

What the deep state FDA did was provide a backdoor way to void the Nuremberg Code, where voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. The deep state FDA has, and continues to contaminate, the national blood supply. They are freakishly conducting human experiments on unsuspecting surgery patients with contaminated blood. Surgery patients have not volunteered to take blood possibly contaminated with HIV or hepatitis. It should be a felony to knowingly give contaminated blood to a patient.",sgtreport.com,news,SGT Report,,-0.0117647058823529,448981663,1,,eng-9417946

Dodoma. Prominent Tanzanian businessman and philanthropist Mustafa Sabodo passed away on Saturday at his Masaki home in Dar es Salaam at the age of 82.

Born in Lindi in 1942, Sabodo was a self-made entrepreneur whose business acumen led to the founding of the Sabodo Group, a conglomerate with interests in construction, manufacturing, and agriculture.

The group operates across Tanzania, India, France, Kenya, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.

Sabodo's legacy extends beyond his business achievements.

He was a staunch patriot who famously intervened during Tanzania's oil crisis in the 1970s. In the 1970s, Tanzania and other countries in the world faced a shortage of fuel, a situation that forced the government to restrict cars from operating on Sundays, while on Saturdays they could operate until 2pm.

That situation forced Sabodo, who was a close friend of then-President Julius Nyerere, to ask permission from the president to personally travel to meet with the then Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, to appeal for fuel to rescue the country from the crisis.

In his past interview with the media, Sabodo said that he believed that Khomeini would listen to him. As such, the government allowed him and he travelled with former National Assembly Speaker, Chief Adam Sapi Mkwawa.

""I am Khoja, a Shia Muslim, and Khomeini is also of the same group. When I met him, I told him about the suffering of Tanzania due to the fuel shortage, and that among those affected are many Shia Muslims.""

""I told him Tanzania is a good country without discrimination, and President Nyerere is a good man. Even his Prime Minister is Rashid Kawawa and the Minister of Minerals and Energy Anoor Kassam are good men. I went on my knees at his feet crying, begging him to provide our country with oil, and he agreed,"" Sabodo said.

However, Khomeini insisted that government officials should be the ones to receive the fuel and not Sabodo.

""I returned to Tanzania and informed the father of the nation, and he told Kawawa and John Malecela, and it was agreed upon. We went to Iran again, this time with the Minister of Finance, Cleopa Msuya, Anoor Kassam for Oil and Transportation, and Peter Noni representing the Bank of Tanzania, along with Adam Sapi Mkwawa,"" he said.

Sabodo said when they met, the leader, Khomeini provided Tanzania with oil worth $80,000.

Additionally, during that trip Sabodo advised Khomeini to open an Iranian embassy in Tanzania, and he agreed. He also did the same for Zambia. As a result, Tanzania opened an embassy in Iran too.

Sabodo's generosity touched various sectors of Tanzanian society.

Although, he was a member of ruling party CCM, Sabodo was a supporter of various political parties, donating funds to both the CCM and the opposition Chadema party.

He also actively funded community initiatives, including educational projects and infrastructure.

Sabodo's philanthropic efforts included significant contributions to the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation, the Mtwara College of Education, and the Shree Hindu Mandal Hospital.

He was also a patron of the Khoja Shia-aheri project. In 2016, Sabodo pledged a $5 billion investment in Dodoma, contingent on the government's relocation of the capital there.

This audacious move reflected his belief in fulfilling the vision of Tanzania's founding president, Mwalimu Nyerere.

Mustafa Sabodo's death leaves a void in Tanzania. He was a respected figure who combined business success with a deep commitment to social progress.

His dedication to his country and his fellow citizens will be remembered for years to come.

Capital markets' confidence in funding projects related to Australia's energy transition has rallied in the past two years amid significant improvements in policy and regulatory certainty, according to the country's most comprehensive report on institutional investors' climate priorities.

Nuclear energy, however, ranked last on the list of technologies to which investors were seeking exposure, the report found, despite the federal opposition elevating the technology to the top of its energy agenda and campaigning for the deployment of nuclear generators in Australia.

Noah Gragson heard the comments last year. There were plenty of them.

Josh Berry said his SHR teammate was the victim of the ""piling on"" mentality in 2023 and he was dragged through the mud. When asked about it, the 25-year-old said the experience changed his online behavior and provided motivation for him.

""I still do read comments every once in a while, but in the past, would read a lot of them, a lot more of them,"" Gragson admitted. ""Definitely, yeah, they do want to pile on, but that's just more fuel for the fire to go out and improve yourself. And to keep on working hard and become the best version of myself that I can become.""

Unfortunately, Noah Gragson's online activity wasn't the only reason he made headlines in 2023. His dust-up with Ross Chastain was the other. What did he learn from that incident?

""I was still getting used to the different aero positions in the car and getting put in bad aero spots, and he put it on my door and I stayed in the gas, not knowing,"" Gragson said. ""And I'm like, man, I'm just kind of over it like -- runs over everyone.

""Ross and I worked out together last year. So like you're gonna see these guys. Whether it be that you see them 20 times a weekend and you're in the same room with them, so it's hard to hold grudges unless you just disappear. With Ross, I was just over it and let my frustration out but at the same time I called him the next day, and I was like, 'Hey, nice connection. Like you threw a good one.'

""But I told him that security guard wasn't there, I was coming and I wasn't going to stop, dude. And, we're all good the next day. We tested a micro-winged sprint car at Millbridge Speedway in North Carolina the next night. So it wasn't too big of a deal.""

While Gragson having beef with Chastain was a big story in 2023, it wasn't anything new for him. He's had conflicts and rivalries with others in the past, including the battle with Ty Gibbs for the Xfinity Series championship the year before. The SHR driver unexpectedly brought up that feud with the Joe Gibbs Racing driver when asked about his opinions on rivalries, something NASCAR President Steve Phelps has encouraged drivers to embrace early in 2024 because the drama is good for the sport.

""I think that's what makes this sport is rivalries, in my opinion,"" he said. ""And sometimes you play it up for the camera. It is a race, but it's also better when you make it a show, right?

""So I would say going through a little bit of a rivalry with Ty Gibbs, it was a lot of head games throughout the season racing for a championship. Ty and I used to be buddies. We're buddies again now but when you're racing somebody for a championship, you're doing everything possible to benefit yourself.""

It's a different Noah Gragson than the one fans saw in 2023, both on and off the track. It's already translated into success and if things continue trending in this same direction, the No. 10 car will be surprising a lot of folks by the end of the year.",heavy.com,news,Heavy,Kyle Dalton,0.0117647058823529,448981534,1,https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Noah-Gragson-2024.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,

""For the current day, electricity imports are forecast at 14,900 megawatt hour (Mwh). No exports are expected,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Ukraine imported 3,300 Mwh a day before the attack on March 22, with exports of 2,148 Mwh.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change.

Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Prominent climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh.

He has been on a fast since the protests started on March 6, surviving only on salt and water in the open in sub-zero temperatures.

Temperatures have been as low as minus six degrees and snowing in recent days.

Mr Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a ""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers [in the region],"" Mr Wangchuk told The Associated Press.

He has been joined by about 200 other people sleeping under the open sky as part of the demonstration.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers -- which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world"" -- are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people.

The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military stand-off between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in [the] making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Mr Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment.

The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Mr Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood and for local legislature to be able to frame their own laws on land and agriculture.

The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Mr Wangchuk recently posted on X.

""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh and continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,-0.207843137254902,448981485,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/678d9af8525a9d308b4064d223651737?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=876&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,eng-9419920

Last week marked the completion of the South Fork offshore wind project off of Long Island, which is New York's first offshore wind project and the third offshore wind project in the U.S. Also recently announced were state-awarded contracts for two offshore wind projects - Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind. Both of these milestones provide a much needed jolt of momentum to the burgeoning U.S. offshore industry, as well as New York's efforts to achieve its ambitious clean energy targets, including the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act's requirement of 70 percent renewable electricity sources by 2030 and zero-emission electricity by 2040. The benefits that these new projects will bring to the state are immense. A successful offshore wind industry will result in the localization of clean energy manufacturing, reinvigorating New York's ports and harbors, training and deploying skilled union workers, improving air quality in environmental justice communities, and protections for the ocean environment and wildlife.

The announcements follow a difficult year for the offshore wind industry and for the renewable energy sector as a whole. Planned projects throughout New York, including offshore wind, faced difficulties due to inflation and supply chain issues, which resulted in higher projected construction costs. In the fall of 2023, these challenges led to calls for uniform inflation adjustments for all renewable energy projects that had awards from the state. The State's denial of these adjustments resulted in numerous project cancellations and a significant reduction in the number of projects expected to be operational in time to help achieve the goal of generating 70 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. These challenges were not limited to New York: in 2023, offshore wind developers canceled 5.5 gigawatts of projects in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

New York, like its neighboring states, has encountered some renewable energy setbacks, yet becoming a global climate and clean energy leader takes courage and tenacity. The good news? With sustained political will from state officials, smart and expedient implementation by the state's key agencies, and a strong tailwind from the historic Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize renewables at the federal level, the Empire State is poised to get back on track if we act quickly and stay the course.

Building on the South Fork Wind project and recently awarded offshore wind contracts, Governor Hochul must continue to show the resolve and leadership needed to deliver on meeting the state's ambitious climate goals. That will require doubling down on the deployment of on and offshore wind, distributed and utility scale solar, grid upgrades, long overdue transmission projects, building electrification, energy efficiency and other proven demand side solutions. Collectively, this approach will minimize the cost and maximize the public health and job creation benefits of meeting New York's nation-leading Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

Meeting the goals outlined in the Climate Act is not only required by law, but it is crucial for safeguarding the health of everyday New Yorkers. Pollution continues to take a heavy toll on our state and disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color. The World Health Organization reports that air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, accounts for nearly seven million deaths globally each year. New York City attributes 2,400 deaths per year to air pollution; and thousands more emergency room visits and hospitalizations for asthma, heart, and lung problems. Rapid deployment of offshore wind presents a clear and present opportunity to accelerate the retirement of the polluting oil and gas power plants that have been impacting disadvantaged communities for decades.

A successful buildout of offshore wind would be a game-changer for how New Yorkers power their homes and for the air they breathe. Take, for example, the completion of the South Fork Wind project in mid-March. With a capacity of 132 megawatts, South Fork Wind has the potential to supply electricity to approximately 70,000 Long Island homes, reducing carbon emissions by up to six million tons annually - the equivalent of removing 60,000 cars from the roads. Not only that, the South Fork project worked with NRDC and other partners on important protections for the endangered Right Whale during construction.

Achieving New York's Climate Act requirements hinges on overcoming barriers to rapidly scaling the deployment of offshore wind and other renewables projects and ensuring that the State's climate objectives are reflected in tangible construction projects. New York's announcement of its fourth round of contract awards for offshore wind projects is a critical step forward, and should be followed by additional rounds later this year. It's imperative that recent offshore wind accomplishments serve as a catalyst that rebuilds momentum towards the timely fulfillment of the Climate Act, and that subsequent offshore wind solicitations - as well as solicitations for land-based solar and wind projects - continue to be expedited to further accelerate progress.

Superannuation giants and other large investors are increasingly willing to plough billions of dollars into Australian renewable energy projects, but have expressed little desire to explore new opportunities in nuclear power.

Capital markets' confidence in funding projects related to Australia's energy transition has rallied in the past two years amid significant improvements in policy and regulatory certainty, according to the country's most comprehensive report on institutional investors' climate priorities.

Nuclear energy, however, ranked last on the list of technologies to which investors were seeking exposure, the report found, despite the federal opposition elevating the technology to the top of its energy agenda and campaigning for the deployment of nuclear generators in Australia.

The findings, to be published on Monday, are based on the annual survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change - a coalition of 104 global and local institutional investors including AustralianSuper, Cbus, HESTA, Fidelity, BlackRock and Vanguard.",theage.com.au,news,The Age,,0.607843137254902,448981277,12,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2586%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_label_no_age_social_wm/4644a630a1e0c1b485ff7dd0fc1bc67303320327,

Planes with flapping wings sound more anime than aerospace, but the world's largest airframers on both sides of the Atlantic are expediting prototypes that could shape the next generation of business and commercial jets in entirely unconventional ways. Their mission?

To make aircraft exceedingly more fuel efficient and help deliver on aviation's sustainability pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2050. In Europe, Airbus is designing radical wing configurations, including one that changes form to counter turbulence, while stateside, Boeing has partnered on NASA's X-66A experimental plane that relies on trusses to support unusually long and slender wings.

The Extra Performance Wing that Airbus is developing ""mimics a bird's feathers and adjusts automatically to maximize aerodynamic flow,"" says Sebastien Blanc, technical wing director for the project, part of the Airbus UpNext program. Flight tests for the 165-foot-long shape-shifting wing will begin next year on a Cessna Citation VII jet. ""Like a bird, it dynamically adapts to conditions, using active control technologies,"" explains Blanc. And its folding wingtips, an ancillary design, will allow for increased performance while fitting into the constraints of the airport gates.

Thin, elongated wings are also integral to the X-66A, a Boeing concept that NASA greenlighted last year as part of its Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program. Spearheading the $1.15 billion plan across a seven-year timeline, Boeing will modify an MD-90 aircraft by shortening the fuselage and mounting the engines under what it calls a Transonic Truss-Braced Wing, which, as the name implies, relies on a set of aerodynamic trusses.

""Our goal was to develop a more sustainable airplane that can replace current single-aisle aircraft,"" says Brent Cobleigh, NASA's X-66A project manager, adding that the latter account for nearly half of global flight emissions. ""With advanced propulsion and lighter-weight materials, we think it will have a 30 percent reduction in fuel burn.""

The industry's goal to reach carbon neutrality in the next 26 years faces strong headwinds in cost alone. Yet with such out-of-the-box concepts being explored by some of the world's biggest aerospace innovators, others may soon be motivated to earn their own sustainability wings.",robbreport.com,news,Robb Report,Michael Verdon,0.2313725490196079,448981271,1,https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/X66A_Plane2.jpg?w=1024,

On the face of it, cutting down trees may seem an unusual tactic for a government department named Climate Action to pursue, but Catalan authorities are doing just that in a Pyrenean forest near village of Molló, less than 10km from the French border.

The expected benefits are twofold. First, to improve biodiversity, and secondly, amid the worst drought ever recorded in Catalonia, to allow more rainwater to enter the river system.

The Department of Climate Action is to carry out selective clearing on a 61-hectare (150-acre) public estate in Molló, Ripollès County, to increase water runoff in the Ter river basin.

The woodland was repopulated 50 years ago with a high density of pine trees.

Anna Sanitjas, director general of the department's forests and environmental management division, explains that the aim is to remove one out of every four trees to improve biodiversity and, at the same time, enable more water to enter the Ritort, a tributary of the Ter.

Authorities hope felling the pine trees will allow them to recover 0.1 cubic hectometers of water, equivalent to the water consumed by 1,370 people a year.

The department hopes to replicate the project in other forests in the nearby counties of Solsonès and Garrotxa.

It is estimated that in 70% of woodland areas in Catalonia, no forest management work has been carried out in the last 50 years. The total area covered by forest has increased by around 10% in the last 25 years, with density also increasing.

To combat this situation, the Department of Climate Action is committed to forest management that improves the health of forests while at the same time generating more blue water (fresh surface and groundwater, in other words, the water in freshwater lakes, rivers and aquifers).

The Catalan government owns around 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of forested land, much of it near the headwaters of rivers and streams.

In the Molló forest, most of the trees compete with each other, which limits their capacity to grow, Sanitjas says. In addition, they consume a large amount of water, ""which does not reach the river.""

""The moment we clear, more light will come in, new species will come in and we will improve biodiversity,"" Sanitjas says.

The operation of removing one out of every four trees will start in a month. Results are expected to be seen ""quickly"" because there will be a ""direct effect.""

Sanitjas sees great potential in expanding the forest management scheme further.

More than 130 people were killed when gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall concert hall on Friday, shooting spectators before setting the building on fire.

""It is necessary to bring back the death penalty when it comes to terrorism and murder,"" Yury Afonin, deputy head of the State Duma's security committee, said on Saturday.

Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council, and Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin - two close allies of Putin - also called for the ""terrorists"" to be ""destroyed"" following the attack.

""Terrorists only understand retaliatory terror...death for death,"" Medvedev said on Friday in a post on Telegram.

The move was also backed by the heads of two other pro-Putin parties in Russia's parliament.

Critics have voiced alarm over the plans, including because of Russia's broad use of counter-terrorism and anti-extremist laws, which have been used to target Kremlin opponents and supporters of Ukraine.

Authorities opened a record 143 terror-related criminal cases in 2023, according to the independent Mediazona news site - up from fewer than 20 a year before 2018.

Earlier this month, Russia's financial monitoring watchdog added the ""international LGBT movement"" to its ""terrorists and extremists"" blacklist.

Alexei Navalny, Putin's most strident critic of the last decade, who died in an Arctic prison colony last month, was among those serving years in prison on ""extremism"" charges.

""If we allow the death penalty for terrorism, do you realize how many people the system would kill?"", women's rights campaigner Alyona Popova said Saturday on Telegram.

""How many people are in prison right now...who are not terrorists in any way?"" she added.",themoscowtimes.com,news,The Moscow Times,Agence France-Presse,-0.403921568627451,448980565,1,https://static.themoscowtimes.com/image/og/ba/84603__ba6ad2c243888d04f2550ccfefc4598a.jpg,

Blackwell is the name of the newest generation of AI graphics processors. The GB200, the company's debut chip, is scheduled to arrive later this year. Nvidia is luring new orders with the promise of more powerful chips. For instance, businesses and software developers are still frantically trying to obtain the most recent generation of ""Hopper"" H100s and related chips. Here are three reasons why this chip will spur demand in the market:

At present the global AI market is seeing a downturn. Analysts ascribed the decline to the impact of US sanctions on China, the meek global chip market, which is clearing excess inventory, and China's feeble economic rebound. It's interesting to note that domestic chip production decreased despite the restrictions and the drop in imports. However, with Nvidia's new chip, the company can easily overcome these issues.

The market for AI technology is enormous; it will likely reach a value of over 1.8 trillion dollars by 2030, up from a projected 200 billion dollars in 2023. The new chip developed by the company will mint good revenue numbers out of this expected growth itself.

With Nvidia's new software, applications on any of the company's GPUs -- even the older models that might be more appropriate for deployment but not AI development -- will operate more smoothly. Nvidia releases an update to its GPU architecture every two years, which unlocks significant performance gains. The company's 2022-announced Hopper architecture, which powers chips like the H100, served as the training ground for a large number of the AI models that have been made public in the last year.

With 20 petaflops of AI capability compared to 4 petaflops for the H100, Nvidia claims that Blackwell-based processors, such as the GB200, offer a significant performance boost for AI firms. AI companies will be able to train more complex and large-scale models because to this increased processing capability.

T&T's Min­is­ter of En­er­gy, Stu­art Young, has been at CER­AWeek, prob­a­bly the most pres­ti­gious glob­al an­nu­al gath­er­ing of en­er­gy in­dus­try lead­ers.

One of the main talk­ing points at the event this year, has been the is­sue of low ex­ist­ing de­mand for low car­bon hy­dro­gen in ma­jor mar­kets.

This sit­u­a­tion rep­re­sents a ma­jor op­por­tu­ni­ty for T&T: I know at first sight this might seem coun­ter­in­tu­itive but let me ex­plain.

While the im­por­tance of low car­bon hy­dro­gen in the en­er­gy tran­si­tion is uni­ver­sal­ly ac­knowl­edged, the in­dus­try is fac­ing a ""chick­en and egg"" prob­lem; there is not much ex­ist­ing de­mand for low car­bon hy­dro­gen in the ma­jor in­dus­tries that need hy­dro­gen as a feed­stock, so the po­ten­tial up­stream pro­duc­ers of low car­bon hy­dro­gen do not see much of an in­cen­tive to in­vest in its pro­duc­tion, but with­out the guar­an­teed sup­ply of low car­bon hy­dro­gen the po­ten­tial buy­ers are not in­vest­ing in up­grad­ing fa­cil­i­ties to bring in new low car­bon hy­dro­gen in ex­change for the ex­ist­ing ""grey hy­dro­gen"" from nat­ur­al gas (where the hy­dro­gen is split from the car­bon atoms in methane).

With­out the in­vest­ments go­ing in to scale up low car­bon hy­dro­gen pro­duc­tion the an­tic­i­pat­ed fall in costs, as hap­pened when wind, so­lar and oth­er re­new­ables ramped up, is not get­ting the op­por­tu­ni­ty to take place.

This means that low car­bon hy­dro­gen costs will re­main high and un­less there is a clear mar­ket ad­van­tage over com­modi­ties pro­duced with tra­di­tion­al ""grey car­bon"" it makes lit­tle sense for in­dus­tries us­ing hy­dro­gen as feed­stock to make the shift.

So, how does that cre­ate an op­por­tu­ni­ty for T&T?

Well, there are three im­por­tant fac­tors that put T&T in a unique po­si­tion, and which cre­ate an op­por­tu­ni­ty for us to take ad­van­tage of the cur­rent un­cer­tain­ty:

1) Lack of avail­abil­i­ty of tra­di­tion­al ""grey hy­dro­gen.""

In stark con­trast to most places try­ing to de­vel­op low car­bon hy­dro­gen, petro­chem­i­cal pro­duc­ers in T&T are fac­ing a sig­nif­i­cant short­fall in the avail­abil­i­ty of hy­dro­gen to­day.

In the Unit­ed States (the main fo­cus for low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment) petro­chem­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties can ac­cess as much nat­ur­al gas as they pos­si­bly need as feed­stock to pro­duce tra­di­tion­al ""grey hy­dro­gen.""

And the nat­ur­al gas prices are low: prices are down be­low US$1.70 per mmb­tu at the Hen­ry Hub in Louisiana at the time of writ­ing this ar­ti­cle.

While gas sales con­tract prices in Trinidad are not reg­u­lar­ly pub­licly re­leased, pub­lished da­ta from var­i­ous in­dus­try re­ports and state­ments from min­is­ters would sug­gest that the gas pur­chase price is high­er that this for any petro­chem­i­cal plant in Point Lisas to­day.

And per­haps even more sig­nif­i­cant­ly plants are sim­ply not able to ac­cess all of the nat­ur­al gas they re­quire to pro­duce ""grey hy­dro­gen."" So, un­like in oth­er mar­kets, in T&T there is an un­met de­mand for hy­dro­gen of any type and plants are there­fore very in­ter­est­ed in ac­cess­ing any hy­dro­gen that might be avail­able.

It is not a ques­tion of sub­sti­tut­ing tra­di­tion­al hy­dro­gen with low car­bon hy­dro­gen, but rather adding new hy­dro­gen.

2) Past in­ef­fi­cien­cy means there is po­ten­tial low car­bon elec­tric­i­ty avail­able.

Un­like most oth­er coun­tries, T&T has had more elec­tric­i­ty gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­i­ty that it needs.

This un­usu­al sit­u­a­tion came about be­cause of the de­ci­sion in 2010 to can­cel the con­struc­tion of the alu­mini­um smelter, though the mod­ern com­bined cy­cle plant to sup­ply the smelter, the TGU plant in La Brea, was still con­struct­ed.

This pow­er plant sup­plies the ma­jor­i­ty of Trinidad's base load low­er, with the oth­er less ef­fi­cient sin­gle cy­cle units be­ing brought on­line as need­ed, and es­pe­cial­ly dur­ing evening pe­ri­ods when de­mand for elec­tric­i­ty ris­es.

Putting a com­bined cy­cle gen­er­a­tion unit on ex­ist­ing sin­gle cy­cle units would count as a low car­bon source of en­er­gy once it is linked to a new hy­dro­gen elec­trol­yser (pro­duc­ing hy­dro­gen from split­ting oxy­gen in wa­ter mol­e­cules rather than car­bon in methane mol­e­cules).

The avail­abil­i­ty of sin­gle cy­cle gen­er­a­tion units in Trinidad there­fore cre­ates a great op­por­tu­ni­ty to pro­duce low car­bon hy­dro­gen.

And the large-scale so­lar project un­der con­struc­tion can al­so pro­vide new green elec­trons dur­ing the day (com­pli­ment­ing the new com­bined cy­cle source that would typ­i­cal­ly kick-in dur­ing the evening).

So, iron­i­cal­ly our past low lev­els of en­er­gy ef­fi­cien­cy can be­come a ben­e­fit to im­prove the eco­nom­ics of new low car­bon hy­dro­gen.

3) Our com­modi­ties are al­most all ex­port­ed.

One of the main dri­ving forces be­hind low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­mand is the new car­bon bor­der ad­just­ment mech­a­nisms (CBAMS) that have been put in place in the Eu­ro­pean Union and like­ly to be adopt­ed in oth­er ma­jor mar­kets in the next few years.

These mech­a­nisms tax spe­cif­ic com­modi­ties at the point of im­port, based on their car­bon in­ten­si­ty.

The prin­ci­ple be­hind these im­port tax­es is to dis­cour­age com­pa­nies from ""off­shoring"" pro­duc­tion to mar­kets that don't al­ready tax car­bon. One of the com­modi­ties set to be taxed un­der the EU CBAM is am­mo­nia.

Most am­mo­nia pro­duced in the world is not ex­port­ed, but rather sold on to neigh­bour­ing fa­cil­i­ties for fur­ther pro­cess­ing, es­pe­cial­ly for fer­tilis­er pro­duc­tion.

So, in the USA most am­mo­nia is sold do­mes­ti­cal­ly, con­vert­ed in­to fer­tilis­ers and sold to farm­ers in the USA.

Trinidad is one of the few places where our am­mo­nia is main­ly ex­port­ed by sea to in­ter­na­tion­al mar­kets.

This means that Trinidad am­mo­nia pro­duc­tion is more like­ly to be im­pact­ed by CBAMS and hence makes low­er car­bon hy­dro­gen an at­trac­tive op­tion to help re­duce po­ten­tial im­port tax­es.

These three fac­tors mean that Trinidad presents a unique op­por­tu­ni­ty for low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment, while the rest of the world is grap­pling with find­ing ways to de­vel­op the mar­ket.

In most coun­tries low car­bon hy­dro­gen needs sig­nif­i­cant gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies to make the de­vel­op­ment pos­si­ble.

As the pre­sen­ta­tions at CER­AWeek made clear, gov­ern­ments in some of those mar­kets, es­pe­cial­ly in the Unit­ed States, are cur­rent­ly work­ing on sub­sidy pack­ages, but they are not there yet.

There are things that need to be put in place to en­sure that we can take ad­van­tage of this op­por­tu­ni­ty but the da­ta I have seen does not sug­gest we need spe­cif­ic heavy Gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies.

Es­sen­tial­ly the sub­sidy has been ""pre-paid"" through our past in­vest­ments in sin­gle cy­cle gas fired pow­er gen­er­a­tion.

One thing that is re­quired is the quick adop­tion of a na­tion­al reg­u­la­to­ry frame­work for mon­i­tor­ing, re­port­ing and ver­i­fi­ca­tion (MRV).

This will be vi­tal for com­pa­nies to be able to take cred­it for any car­bon re­duc­tion ini­tia­tives, in the con­text of CBAMS and car­bon mar­kets. This is­sue will be a ma­jor top­ic of dis­cus­sion at the up­com­ing Caribbean Sus­tain­able En­er­gy Con­fer­ence on June 10 to 12 2024.

The unique po­si­tion that Trinidad holds pro­vides a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ty to move fast and en­ter the low car­bon hy­dro­gen mar­ket quick­ly.

Ex­ist­ing am­mo­nia plants in Point Lisas do not need sig­nif­i­cant cap­i­tal in­vest­ment to be able to blend in vol­umes of hy­dro­gen from new sources (up to some­where in the re­gion of 10 to 20 per cent of cur­rent hy­dro­gen).

If we can rapid­ly jump on the unique op­por­tu­ni­ty that ex­ists, we could make a small per­cent of low hy­dro­gen avail­able and take a lead­ing glob­al role.",guardian.co.tt,news,Trinidad Guardian,,-0.3411764705882353,448980504,1,http://www.guardian.co.tt/image-3.5210519.464035.20240324121546.91dc3d7d27,

However, after the openers' early dismissal, it was the knock of skipper Sanju Samson that stabilised the innings for the Royals. Samson amassed 82* runs in 52 deliveries, and was accompanied by Riyan Parag, who came on his own, scoring 43 runs in 29 deliveries.

Furthermore, Shimron Hetmyer failed to go big, scoring five runs in seven deliveries, with Dhruv Jurel adding 20* runs in 12 balls as Royals posted a total of 193 runs in the first innings, losing just four wickets in the process.

As for Lucknow Super Giants, Naveen-ul-Haq was the highest wicket-taker for his side in the first innings, with two wickets to his name. Mohsin Khan and Ravi Bishnoi took one wicket each as well.

MUNICH - Companies and inventors filed 199 275 patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) last year, an increase of 2.9% on the previous year and the highest number to date, according to the EPO's Patent Index 2023 published March 19. This follows growth of 2.6% in 2022 and 4.7% in 2021. Patent applications, which are filed to help protect and market inventions, are an early indicator of companies' R&D investments, a press release stated by EPO.

""Our latest Patent Index shows that innovation remained vibrant around the world in 2023,"" said EPO President António Campinos. ""The EPO was entrusted with examining more applications than ever before, attesting to both the attractiveness of the European technology market and the high quality of our products and services. Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are making ever-increasing use of patents, with the share of applications from SMEs at its highest level yet last year. These businesses can also now benefit from the new Unitary Patent, which significantly improves the environment for innovation in Europe, providing a simpler and more cost-effective option for innovators to protect their inventions and bring them to the vast EU market.""

Boom in inventions in digital communication and energy technologies

The leading technical fields for patent applications at the EPO last year were digital communication (which covers technologies related to mobile networks), medical technology and computer technology. The strongest growth among all technology fields in 2023, however, was in electrical machinery, apparatus, energy (+12.2% over 2022), which covers inventions related to clean-energy technologies, including batteries (+28%). Patent activity in biotechnology (+5.9%) also continued to rise further.

Global and European trends

The top five countries of origin for European patent applications in 2023 were the United States, Germany, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea. Some 43% of the total applications came from companies and inventors from the EPO's 39 member states, while 57% originated from outside Europe.

The number of patent applications originating from the EPO's 39 member states increased again in 2023 (85,748 applications, +1.8%). European companies posted above average growth in the fields of digital communication (+10.7%), biotechnology (+6.4%), computer technology (+4.2%) and measurement (+4.0%).

Finland, Spain, UK and Italy with strongest growth in Europe

Patent applications from companies and inventors in Germany, Europe's leading country of origin, were back to growth (+1.4%) last year compared to 2022, while French firms filed slightly fewer applications (-1.5%). Patent filings from most other European countries were up. Among the larger patent filing countries (with over 5,000 applications), the highest growth came from the UK (+4.2%), Italy (+3.8%), the Netherlands (+3.5%), Switzerland (+2.7%) and Sweden (+2.0%). Even stronger increases (among European countries with over 1,000 applications) were posted by Finland (+9.2%) and Spain (+6.9%). In terms of patent applications per capita, Switzerland again led the rankings, followed by several Nordic countries.

More inventions from China and Republic of Korea

The overall growth in patent applications at the EPO in 2023 was mainly fuelled by steep increases from the Republic of Korea (+21.0%) and the People's Republic of China (+8.8% compared with 2022). The Republic of Korea entered the top five for the first time, while patent applications from China have more than doubled since 2018.

Other countries that showed significant growth in patent filings at the EPO last year, albeit from smaller volumes, include Canada (+2.6%), Brazil (+4.1%), Chinese Taipei (+5.9%), India (+8.4%) and Singapore (+22.3%).

Huawei tops applicant ranking

Huawei was again the leading applicant at the EPO in 2023 - increasing its applications significantly to over 5 000 and accounting for almost a quarter of all filings to the EPO from China. Samsung and LG were ranked No. 2 and 3, and together made up two-thirds of all European patent applications originating from the Republic of Korea. Qualcomm and Ericsson rounded out the top five. The top ten includes four companies from Europe, two from the Republic of Korea, two from the US and one from each of China and Japan.

Nearly every fourth application from Europe filed by a small company

But patents are also very important for small businesses: In 2023, 23% of patent applications to the EPO originating in Europe was filed by an individual inventor or a small or medium-sized enterprise (with fewer than 250 employees). A further 8% came from universities and public research organizations (see graph Breakdown of applicants by category). As part of its ongoing support for smaller entities, the EPO has announced new fee reductions as of April 1, 2024 for micro-enterprises, individuals, non-profits, universities and public research organizations.

Spotlight on women inventors

This year's Patent Index also looks at the contribution of women to innovation. For all patent applications filed with the EPO last year coming from Europe, 27% named at least one woman as an inventor. Among the larger European patent filing countries (with more than 2,000 applications per year), Spain (46%), France (33%) and Belgium (32%) had the highest share of patent applications naming at least one woman as inventor in 2023. In terms of technology sectors, the proportion ranged from 14% on average for patent applications in mechanical engineering to 50% in chemistry. This data can help in addressing the gaps that remain to be bridged to harness the full potential of women inventors.

Solid uptake of new Unitary Patent

Since June 1, 2023, innovators can also benefit from the Unitary Patent system - a new way to enjoy simpler and cheaper patent protection in 17 EU member states, in which a European patent has unitary legal effect and can be enforced or litigated before the new Unified Patent Court. The new system has already proven popular with patent owners: unitary protection was requested for 17.5% of all European patents granted in 2023 (more than 18,300 requests filed) and for 22.3% of those granted in the second half of 2023 after the system was launched. Patentees from Europe (39 EPO member states) had the highest uptake rate at 25.8%, followed by those from the US and China (both 10.9%), Republic of Korea (9.7%) and Japan (4.9%). The top Unitary Patent requestors in 2023 were Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Qualcomm, Samsung and Ericsson. Of the patentees who have transformed their European patents into Unitary Patents, some two-thirds are European.",agip-news.com,news,AGIP,,0.5294117647058822,448980178,1,,

SAF accounts for just 0.2% of the jet fuel market but policymakers including US President Joe Biden see its adoption as a way to meet goals on lowering carbon emissions.

But SAF, a biofuel made from plant or animal materials including used cooking oil or agricultural waste, is up to five times more expensive than regular fuel.

""There's one big negative and that's the cost,"" Williams said at a conference near Chicago. ""As we think about how we want to grow SAF ... we have got to focus on how do we minimise the costs.""

Williams said demand for jet fuel could increase from 7-million barrels a day now to 12-million barrels a day in 2050. Seven million barrels a day is the same as the International Energy Agency's estimate for all jet fuel demand. By comparison, current production of SAF is only 71.8-million litre per year, as per US government data.

Here's why.,"During a total solar eclipse, the moon lines up in front of the sun so perfectly, it would put most posts from Reddit's r/perfectfit community to shame.

The perfection of the alignment is a big part of an eclipse's beauty. But why is it so perfect?

Why do the sun and moon line up so perfectly?

This won't take long to explain because there's a simple answer: they have almost the exact same angular diameter -- a measure in cosmology for determining the size of objects in the sky. If you're into math, you can calculate angular diameter using a mathematical formula similar to the one used in geometry for calculating circular chord length.

You can also estimate angular diameter by stretching your arm all the way out in front of you and holding up one finger. The sun (to be measured only when you're wearing your eclipse glasses) has an angular diameter of approximately half of your fingertip, meaning 0.5 degrees. The moon's angular diameter varies a little more than the sun's but it's still always approximately half a fingertip, or 0.5 degrees -- same as the sun.

There's yet another, possibly simpler way of describing this, University of Arizona astronomer Chris Impey told Mashable. ""The gist of the coincidence is that the sun is 400 times larger than the moon, and 400 times further away,"" Impey said.

Is there a non-scientific explanation for the eclipse coincidence?

The technical answer is the only answer. There is no reason or deeper significance. It's a coincidence. It's a very fortuitous coincidence since the sight of total solar eclipses can be life-altering, and such eclipses have been necessary for some of the most important discoveries in history -- such as the famous 1919 Eddington experiment that validated Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. But they're nonetheless just coincidences, and from an astronomical bean-counter's standpoint there's not much else to say about them.

But that doesn't mean there's nothing more to say about the insane good luck that allows us to witness them.

""We can certainly say that in the solar system, it's unique and there's nothing even close to it,"" Impey said. For instance, Mars' potato-shaped moon Phobos produces rather clumsy solar eclipses, including in 2024, and NASA's Perseverance rover photographed it. The site of a lumpy, oblong shadow transforming the sun temporarily into a Muppet's eye is undeniably cool, but Earth's eclipses are elite by comparison.

""We can certainly say that in the solar system, it's unique and there's nothing even close to it.""

Other objects, like satellites and planes, pass in front of the sun all the time. For that matter, if you want to be annoying about it, you can create a one-person ""eclipse"" any time you want by putting on a hat. But very rarely are we Earthlings lucky enough to see heavenly bodies other than the moon eclipse the sun. It does happen, however, like when Venus and Mercury transit the sun, a breathtaking and rare event in which a planet is briefly visible as a tiny dot silhouetted against our star. But transits only serve to underscore the mind-blowing harmony of the sun and moon's convergence during eclipse totality.

Are there total eclipses elsewhere in the universe?

""Probably somewhere out there, there are eclipses,"" said Impey. ""Planet-planet eclipses? Probably. A planet-moon eclipse like ours could happen too, but we have zero information to go on there,"" he continued. The odds of a planet having a sun and moon with the same basic shape and the same angular diameter visible from a solid viewing surface isn't something that can easily be calculated -- there are just too many moving parts involved, and astronomers have not yet definitively discovered any exomoons, so we have to rely on the measurements within our own solar system -- a very tiny dataset.

But there are ways of illustrating the coincidence that don't require us to quantify how rare it is.

""Probably somewhere out there, there are eclipses.""

The diameter of the sun is about 865,370 miles, compared to the moon's 2,159.1 miles. That's a big differential: the number of miles three very dependable cars will drive before they stop working entirely, versus the number of miles someone can drive in three days.

An amateur astronomer posting on the Nasaspaceflight.com web forum once crunched the numbers and analogized the sizes of the sun and moon to a yoga ball and a lentil. Now picture a grape called ""Earth"" floating in space. From the surface of this grape, looking out into the void, there'll come a time when the aforementioned galactic yoga ball will be perfectly covered up by this one single solitary space lentil.

And that's more or less what happens during every total solar eclipse.

Does the eclipse coincidence unlock a larger secret about what makes Earth unique?

Short answer: probably not.

Earth is overflowing with rare phenomena compared to other planets. It's pretty wild, after all, that Earth happens to have a pleasant amount of gravity, a livable climate, liquid water, a magnetic field to protect us from solar radiation, and all the other things that make life possible. But that's not a coincidence. It's just an observation of the necessary conditions for life, from the standpoint of an alive being, currently here to enjoy them.

So are the sun and moon's angular diameters another one of these precursors to a livable planet? We do, after all, need our sun at right about its current orbital distance, or we likely wouldn't have the temperatures we need to survive, but in some other reality, a cooler, closer sun, or a hotter, more distant sun could probably provide the conditions we need. That's why astronomers looking for exoplanets beyond our solar system in the ""Goldilocks Zone"" of habitability are often attracted to planets that orbit much closer to their stars than we do ours.

And as for the moon, while it's true that its tidal effects are crucial to the lives of, say, mollusks, and the moon's light is pretty important for, um, dung beetles (yes, really), it's doubtful the moon's mere existence in our orbit -- let alone its angular diameter -- is a necessary precursor for life on Earth. Granted, an entirely moonless Earth is a drastically different counterfactual world, and to suppose that humans might not have evolved in such a reality is far from an outlandish hypothesis. But even if we grant that a moon is necessary for all life, habitability almost certainly has nothing to do with our moon's specific angular diameter.

In fact, while there is at least one such hypothesis out there about the moon being crucial to the original formation of DNA from Scottish molecular biologist Richard Lathe, this moon-centric Genesis story relies on conditions that are no longer present on Earth anyway. Impey cautions that moon-centric explanations of life ""are not compelling arguments,"" but they are illustrative, and are worth dwelling on briefly, so please stay with me.

As all mollusks know, the moon's gravity ""pulls up"" on bodies of water here on Earth, creating our tides. Lathe theorizes that the DNA molecules that eventually evolved into us humans originally formed in the violent churning of turbulent seas in which the tides were constantly in dramatic, hour-by-hour flux. That's because the moon was much closer to Earth back in those primordial days, and its gravity would have routinely created vertigo-inducing tsunami-like tides as it orbited. In fact, the moon at one time would have been a vast disc that dominated the sky like one of the UFOs from the movie Independence Day. That means a total solar eclipse back then would have lasted hours and hours, and would have looked like an enormous moon utterly engulfing the puny sun.

Not just a coincidence of geometry, but also of time

Regardless of whether or not we technically ""need"" the moon, the fact that the moon's presence in our sky was once gargantuan leads us to the melancholy fact that the current state of these celestial objects -- as with the states of all celestial objects -- is transitory. The moon's angular diameter was once immense because it was closer to us. It was, and still is, moving away from us at a rate of about an inch per year. Its angular diameter will shrink down further and further, and it'll become smaller and smaller in the sky.

In other words, the astonishing aesthetic unity of a total solar eclipse on Earth isn't just a cosmic coincidence; it's a temporary cosmic coincidence, and you happen to be around to witness and comprehend its unlikelihood -- to the extent that anyone can comprehend such a thing.

If the Lathe hypothesis is right, and an enormous lunar disc in the sky was necessary for the start of life on Earth, perhaps the moon at approximately its current size in the sky is a necessary precondition for such a stable ecosystem that we can develop agriculture, math, and eventually the astronomical know-how required to grasp the sheer immensity of our good fortune when we see an eclipse.

There's a total solar eclipse somewhere on Earth every year or two, but seeing one is tricky -- you have to anticipate the event, and possibly travel to a locale inside the narrow path of totality. As Impey explains, this only underscores the historical coincidence that makes eclipse-viewing a potential hobby. ""Until the modern age of travel, an average person would be unlikely to ever see an eclipse in their lifetime in the place they live, or a place they could get to easily,"" he said.

""Until the modern age of travel, an average person would be unlikely to ever see an eclipse in their lifetime in the place they live, or a place they could get to easily.""

In a 1980 Rolling Stone interview, the legendary astronomer Carl Sagan brushed off the idea that humanity can ever fully understand the cosmos. ""We are bathing in mystery and confusion on many subjects, and I think that will always be our destiny,"" Sagan said, and added that our universe, ""will always be much richer than our ability to understand it.""

Perfectly straddling the line between the richness of our universe and our ability to understand it is the phenomenon of a total solar eclipse. Since humans are the only known arbiters of beauty, a solar eclipse right here on Earth might be the most beautiful cosmic coincidence that can -- or will -- ever be observed anywhere, at any time, in the entire universe. Can scientists explain and quantify the phenomena that give rise to this coincidence? Absolutely. Can they tell you how beautiful that coincidence is and how lucky you are to be here for it? Nope.

Here's how you can snag some pictures of the event without ruining your equipment.

As the 2024 solar eclipse approaches, you may be interested in capturing this rare astronomical event through photography. The eclipse offers a unique opportunity to witness the moon briefly blocking the sun -- and if you're in the path of totality, it's even more stunning.

If you love astronomy, capturing a solar eclipse photo is the perfect way to remember such a rare event. All you'll need is a few tools at your disposal and a little bit of practice.

We're going to lead with this, though. You can use your iPhone with some added gear, but you probably don't want to.

The first thing you'll want to do before you even think about taking up solar photography is get yourself a set of ISO 12312-2-certified solar viewing glasses. This is non-optional.

the National Institutes of Health, viewing the sun without eye protection can result in solar retinopathy, in which the retina is burned and even potentially scarred. While this is only a temporary -- and very painful -- experience for many, it can result in permanent vision loss.

Fortunately, there's no shortage of certified safe solar viewing glasses available on the Internet, so you should definitely pick up a pair -- or several!

As tempting as it may be to take your favorite camera out and point it directly at the sun, we suggest you don't do that. Cameras comprise an array of delicate sensors, many of which can be easily damaged or destroyed by the sun.

Fortunately, solar filters are available for your camera. Which filter you'll need depends on your camera lens, so we suggest doing some research.

Once you have the appropriate filter, try to get outside a few sunny days before the eclipse and begin practicing your skills.

NASA suggests DSLR photographers start with a fixed aperture of f/8 to f/16 and trying shutter speeds between 1/1000 and 1/4 seconds to see what works best for your camera.

Once totality hits -- if you're lucky enough to be in the path -- you can remove your filter and shoot without it. Totality only lasts a few minutes, so you'll want to be prepared. Once it's over, your solar filter goes right back on.

If your goal is to take some award-winning photos of the eclipse with your iPhone, you'll want to temper your expectations. If you've ever tried to take a picture of the moon, only to be disappointed at the tiny white blob on your screen, you already know what will probably happen when you photograph the sun.

That doesn't mean that you should give up your dreams of capturing the eclipse on April 8 As NASA points out, there are a couple of routes you can take.

Like many things, it's really up to how much time and money you're willing to invest.

The first option is to focus less on the sun and more on the day's activities. NASA suggests setting up your phone on a tripod and taking a time-lapse of the eclipse. This is a great way to capture the otherworldly feel of the eclipse without needing any fancy extras.

Shadows, too, do something interesting during the eclipse, and capturing those can lead to some great photographs.

Of course, there's still a chance you'll want to photograph the sun directly. If so, you'll need to pick up three items.

The first is a zoom lens attachment in the 12x to 18x range -- these are usually marketed as the type of lenses birders use for photographing wildlife. Digital zoom isn't going to cut it when photographing the sun, so this buy is non-optional.

If you're looking for a lens to get you started, Apexel offers an 18x 4-in-1 Telephoto lens kit that includes a couple of extra lenses and a tripod for $30.99.

If you want to go with even more zoom, Apexel offers a 20-40x telephoto lens kit that includes a tripod and universal phone mount and it's available for $45.99.

The second item you'll want to grab is a solar filter for your lens. Not every zoom lens for the iPhone has swappable filters, but some do. If yours doesn't, you can get a filter you simply hold before the lens, which can work in a pinch.

The last item is a tripod. When working so zoomed in, any bump or jostle you make will ruin what could have been a great photo. We suggest snagging a tripod that allows for a fair amount of fine-tuning so you can set up the perfect shot without much issue.

Once you've got those items, it's time to practice. We suggest practicing solar and lunar photography a few days before the eclipse as you'll only have a few minutes to snag your shot.

When photographing the solar eclipse, you can certainly use Apple's built-in Camera app. However, we suggest something more like Halide, which gives you easier access to settings you'll need to retool to get the perfect shot.

Practice makes perfect! Don't wait until the day of the eclipse to begin honing your new skills. It's always a smart idea to practice using the equipment, settings, and apps you plan to use on that day.

Don't limit yourself to only photographing the sun. Some of the most striking solar photography you'll see after the eclipse won't even center the eclipse itself. Otherworldly shadows and awed onlookers can make for fantastic subjects for photos.

""This is an area where there are security concerns. It is an undeniable fact, we have been attacked several times. The enemies are trying to destroy the nuclear industry and are planning to take it from Iran,"" said Kamalvandi in an interview on Friday.

Making no reference to the nature and timing of the attacks, he added that Iran's nuclear officials have taken into account ""security issues"" over the past two years.

One of the most significant attack on Iran's nuclear program occurred in 2010 when the Stuxnet computer virus disrupted the control systems of the country's most sensitive and tightly watched nuclear facility in Natanz. The Dutch daily Volkskrant reported in January that the malware, widely believed to be an American-Israeli creation, was delivered by a Dutch engineer working at the enrichment plant.

In 2020 and 2021, two internal explosions hit Iran's highly protected Natanz uranium enrichment facility, inflicting considerable damage. The attacks were attributed to Israel, although Iran's chief adversary never took responsibility. In November 2020, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, known as the father of Iran's nuclear program was assassinated in broad daylight near Tehran.

In another part of his interview, Kamalvandi hailed what he called the ""technological achievements"" of Iran's nuclear program, saying they have had positive impacts on ""people's living standards as well as on the country's political and economic issues."" In fact, Iran's economy has tremendously suffered because of sanctions imposed for its nuclear program. In more than a decade, the country's economic growth has averaged zero.

However, Kamalvandi claimed that the sanctions have turned into ""a strong point for the country and the nuclear industry.""

Over the past six years, the rial, Iran's national currency, has fallen 15-fold, fueling inflation and plunging millions of citizens into poverty. Eqtesad 24 news website reported in February that almost one in every three Iranians is currently living below the poverty line as a result of very high inflation in the past five years.

Reports received earlier in March by Iran International indicate a significant drop in people's purchasing power and the elimination of many food items in their diets, including red meat, chicken, and fish. According to Iranians newspapers, canned tuna prices have jumped by 113% in the past 12 months and prices for red meat by 100%.

Kamalvani also announced Tehran's plans to ""develop the capacity of Iran's nuclear industry"" and construct new nuclear power plants in the country.

""To build a 1,000 megawatts nuclear plant requires an investment of about $5 billion. So when you are planning to add 20,000 megawatts of power to the grid, it requires a $100 billion investment,"" said the spokesperson for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, further adding that Tehran cannot rely on domestic sources alone to further its nuclear projects.

Nevertheless, he did not specify which foreign funding sources the Iranian government would employ to achieve these ambitious goals. Most international investors are reluctant to do business in Iran due to sanctions and the country's volatile political situation. What is clear is that Iran cannot afford to develop its nuclear energy sector on its own. In January, Vahid Shahri, an economics professor, warned that Iran's economic needs total $500 billion is pushing the country towards ""catastrophe."" In a desperate attempt to cover its expenses, the government has considerably increased taxes.

Citing growing relations between Tehran and Moscow, Kamalvani stated that Iran ""has agreements with Russia"" to build several nuclear power plants. ""Bushehr plant has been delivered [by Russia] and two others are now under construction,"" he went on to say.

In recent years, Tehran and Moscow have strengthened their political, military, communication, and cyber ties, prompting concerns among Western countries and their allies. Their cooperation has grown significantly, particularly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Kamalvandi further hailed Iran's efforts in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), saying despite ""massive campaigns by opposing sides"" in the IAEA, Tehran has been ""generally successful"" in its bid to lessen international pressures on the Islamic Republic and its nuclear program. ""We are now in a situation where the IAEA does not play into our enemies' hands and is not at their disposal the way they want,"" he stressed.

Contrary to what the Iranian official alleges, the IAEA has been vocal about the irregularities and violations in Tehran's nuclear program. During the recent Board of Governors' meeting in Geneva earlier in the month, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted concerns, including the deactivation of surveillance devices, barring of senior inspectors, and refusal to disclose new nuclear facilities by the Iranian regime.",iranintl.com,news,ایران اینترنشنال,,-0.1529411764705882,448980047,1,"https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/6a84193134eb22e35f3c465afc2321930e157454-850x600.png?rect=0,77,850,446&w=1200&h=630&fm=webp&q=70",

""For the current day, electricity imports are forecast at 14,900 megawatt hour (Mwh). No exports are expected,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Ukraine imported 3,300 Mwh a day before the attack on March 22, with exports of 2,148 Mwh.

Generating and transmission facilities were attacked by Russia on Friday, causing significant blackouts in many regions. Energy facilities in three Ukrainian regions were also attacked and on this Sunday morning.

""Losses (of Friday's attack) have already been assessed and the DTEK group has lost 50% of its generating capacity, we can say this information officially,"" the head of Yasno distribution firm Serhiy Kovalenko told a national television.

He gave no more details. DTEK, Ukraine's largest private power generating company, has not commented on this information yet.

Kovalenko said Russians attacked two parts of the energy system - generation and distribution, hitting both thermal and hydropower plants.

""The enemy hit hard at grid nodes and transformers,"" he said.

The Gun Owners of America, which has been around since 1976, has seen a spike in membership following the NRA's recent fall from grace.

The NRA was the most powerful gun rights group in the nation for decades but lost hundreds of thousands of members following allegations of fraud and abuse. To deal with the mass exodus, the organization also cut programs that were popular with its members, such as gun training, which led to more people leaving.

On top of that, the organization and its longtime head, Wayne LaPierre, were found liable by a Manhattan jury in a civil case earlier this year. Jurors agreed LaPierre had ""violated his statutory obligation to discharge the duties of his position in good faith"" and that his actions cost the organization $5.4 million.

""The NRA is little more than a shell of itself after hemorrhaging hundreds of millions in legal fees,"" Joshua Powell, a former top NRA official who settled with the state before the trial, told the New York Times.

There was a time when the NRA's blessing or opposition meant passage or defeat for gun legislation. The once-powerful lobbying group was both feared and revered in Washington and had been championing Second Amendment rights since 1871.

Between 2003 and 2013, the organization scored 230 legislative victories, including passing six state laws that forbid municipalities from limiting gun rights. Despite those wins, the NRA was unable to secure the expansion of concealed carry, as well as a change to laws restricting gun silencers when the GOP had full control of the House, Senate, and the White House in 2017 and 2018. As mass shootings piled up, public pressure on lawmakers to find a compromise grew, and the core members of the NRA started looking elsewhere for representation.

According to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government ethics watchdog, the NRA raised only $213 million in 2022. While that may seem like a lot, it marked a 52% drop in overall revenue for the organization.

Coupled with New York Attorney General Letitia James's huge win against LaPierre and NRA, the writing was on the wall that the once mighty organization was in trouble.

Despite its dwindling numbers, the NRA still carries some clout and attracts high-profile speakers to its events.

Last month, former President Donald Trump was the keynote speaker at the NRA Presidential Forum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was his eighth address to NRA members and one in which he again cast himself as ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.""

He added that if he wins the presidency in November, ""no one will lay a finger on your firearms.""

Trump first spoke at the NRA in 2015, and in 2016, he made a promise to ""never let NRA members down.""

The GOA proudly pitches itself as the ""no compromise"" gun group and spent more than $3 million last year on lobbying efforts. It has capitalized on the NRA's financial and legal woes and emerged as a power player in politics.

""Obviously, there is going to be overlap, but what I think is unique about Gun Owners of America is that we are the 'no compromise' lobby group in D.C.,"" Erich Pratt, senior vice president for GOA, told the Washington Examiner. ""We have never supported gun control, not even so-called 'gun control-lite' like other groups have. Whether we are fighting in the courts or lobbying in the halls of Congress, we are opposing all limitations on our Second Amendment rights. I think that's what really makes us unique in this.""

Pratt, a father of 11 who is on a church mission in Mexico, is acutely aware there is an appetite for gun control, especially in an election year, but said his organization refuses to budge.

In fact, there are at least a dozen people on staff who are actively monitoring comments lawmakers are making and actions they are taking. If they do not embrace the organization's hard-line approach to gun control, GOA may turn on them.

""There are millions of Americans who don't want compromise,"" Pratt said. ""I realize that that is always the politician's tug, to go that direction, but we hope to be that anchor that holds them to the Constitution, that holds them to their oath of office, and we will give them the grassroots support if they will do that. On the other hand, if they are going to go their own way and drift out to sea and support compromise, then they aren't going to get any help from us in getting reelected or elected to office.""

Like the NRA, the GOA has election guides for its members and grades lawmakers on their commitment to the Second Amendment.

""It's kind of a big production,"" Pratt said. ""We have a lot of people who are producing the survey, who are gathering the votes, who are putting all of these things together, reaching out to the candidates to make sure they answer our survey, etc. And if they don't, in some cases, we'll even put pressure on them and have the grassroots say, 'Hey, how come you're not answering the GOA survey? That's not a good indication. You call yourself a good Republican? Are you trying to hide something?'""

The GOA's no-compromise stance was underscored by its opposition to a compromise gun control bill in 2022. The measure was the first bipartisan gun control bill since 1994.

""The GOA was formed in the 1970s because they believed the NRA was too liberal,"" said Robert Spitzer, the author of several books on guns and a professor emeritus at SUNY Cortland in New York. ""True to its creed, the GOA has opposed every manner of gun law and attacked the NRA at every turn.""

Pratt said the goal of GOA is to grow its membership and dispel myths people have about gun rights groups.

""The biggest misconception is that they think guns are the problem, so they think we are kind of merchants of death who are fuel to gun crime,"" he said. ""Our counter to that is that we fight for Second Amendment rights because it is the amendment that protects all of our other rights.""

Pratt added that he is aware people ""tend to think Second Amendment groups are just for white males.""

To change that perception, GOA sponsors, along with other gun groups, hold an annual event in Detroit to help train women from the inner city on how to use firearms.

""It's all for free for them,"" Pratt said, adding that last year, 1,400 women were trained over the weekend.

The organization is also gearing up for its first national summit in August.

The Knoxville, Tennessee, event is expected to draw tens of thousands of attendees and will be held three months ahead of the 2024 presidential election, which Pratt called ""the most critical in history for Second Amendment rights.""",washingtonexaminer.com,news,Washington Examiner,Barnini Chakraborty,-0.0117647058823529,448979993,1,https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP24079766629949.jpg,

IPL 2024 Gujarat Titans squad, GT match schedule: Gujarat Titans won the IPL 2022 in their first season and ended runners-up in their second (IPL 2023) edition, but that was under Hardik Pandya -- who has since gone on to lead Team Indian in the shortest format. So, their new skipper, talented youngster Shubman Gill will hope that the Gujarat Giants are his launchpad to bigger things as well. But first, he will have to ensure a top-two finish (at least) to hold the trajectory of the over-achieving side's graph.

For that, Gill has the services of David Miller, Kane Williamson and keep-batters Matthew Wade and Wriddhiman Saha up top. Alongside them, will be all-rounders like Azmatullah Omarzai, B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan (not to be confused with the Bollywood superstar) and ""Mr 3D"" Vijay Shankar -- who will be itching to carve a niche for themselves in IPL 2024.

They'll be sorely missing the services of last year's star bowler Mohammad Shami who's out with injury, but they have another superstar Afghan spinner Rashid Khan to bowl the opposition out. He will be supported by the likes of Umesh Yadav, Jayant Yadav, IPL sensation Rahul Tewatia, Sai Kishore and Mohit Sharma.

But how the talent is utilised and churned will depend on the young shoulders of Gill!

Called ""Nuclear War: A Scenario,"" the book by Pulitzer Prize-finalist Annie Jacobsen offers an evidence-backed but theoretical view into what might happen were D.C. and the Pentagon hit by a nuclear bomb.

The immediate result would, of course, be pure destruction.

""In the first fraction of a millisecond after the bomb strikes the Pentagon, there is light,"" an excerpt from the book published to the New York Post reads. ""Soft X-ray light with a very short wavelength. The light superheats the surrounding air to millions of degrees, creating a massive fire-ball that expands at millions of miles per hour.""

""Within seconds, this fireball increases to a diameter of a little more than a mile, it's light and heat so intense that concrete surfaces explode, metal objects melt or evaporate, stone shatters, humans instantaneously convert into combusting carbon,"" the excerpt continues.

""The five-story, five-sided structure and everything inside its 6.5 million square feet of office space explode into superheated dust; all 27,000 Pentagon employees perishing instantly. Not a single thing in the fireball remains. Nothing. Ground zero is zeroed,"" the excerpt concludes.

Horrific, right? Not necessarily.

To promote the excerpt, the Post asked its subscribers on the social media platform X, ""What would happen to Washington, DC if attacked by a nuclear bomb?""

And well, responding to the question, many critics seemed actually quite enamored by the idea of the Pentagon and all its employees going up into flames.

But the truth of the matter is that a nuclear bomb hitting D.C. would annihilate more than just hated members of the government. According to Jacobsen, it'd also destroy Arlington National Cemetery.

""Northwest of the Pentagon, all 639 acres of Arlington National Cemetery -- including the visitors paying respects on this early spring afternoon, the groundskeepers mowing the lawn and the white-gloved members of the Old Guard keeping watch over the Tomb of the Unknowns -- are instantly transformed into combusting and charred human figurines,"" the excerpt reads.

These folks, including those in the Pentagon, would be the lucky ones because they'd die instantly. As for those who survived the initial blast, they'd be in for a world of hurt.

""There's a baseball game going on at Nationals Park,"" the excerpt continues. ""The clothes on a majority of the 35,000 visitors catch on fire. Those who don't quickly burn to death suffer intense third-degree burns, their bodies stripped of the outer layer of skin.""

""Third-degree burns require immediate specialized care to prevent death. Here inside the park there might be a few thousand people who somehow survive initially, people now desperately in need of a bed at a burn treatment center. But all of them are almost certainly now destroyed,"" the excerpt adds.

A powerful weather system battered the tri-state area with heavy rain and strong winds over the weekend, as a fast-moving storm blanketed northern New England with snow and plunged some 360,000 households in the Northeast into blackouts.

At 6 a.m. ET Sunday, more than 197,000 households in Maine, 81,000 in New York state, and 73,000 in New Hampshire were without power, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates live outage data.

""Keep you and your family safe if you lose power,"" Robert Buxton, Director of the New Hampshire Department of Safety's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said Saturday night. ""Crews are out and working hard to restore outages as they happen. If you come across downed wires, stay away and call 911.""

He recommended staying updated with phone alerts or by radio broadcast, using flashlights, rather than candles, for emergency lighting, and refraining from using gas stoves or ovens for alternative heat.

A flood watch went into effect Saturday morning for the New York City metro area through central and southern New Jersey. The storm was expected to dump up to 4 inches of rain on parts of the region.

Gov. Kathy Hochul urged New Yorkers to ""stay off the roads, don't crowd the plow and avoid downed power lines.""

The heaviest rainfall had been expected in the afternoon and early evening of Saturday, and minor flooding in low-lying areas such as roads and yards is possible.

By Sunday morning, footage showed the Northeast blanketed in snow, down trees in New York City, and flooded roads and highways across the region.

The National Weather Service had placed the New York City area under a wind advisory Saturday, with winds up to 25 mph expected throughout the region.

The weather agency cautioned that winds of that speed could cause flying debris, power outages and could send unsecured objects flying into the air.

Weather conditions caused major delays across New York City airports. Arrivals at John F. Kennedy International Airport were delayed an average of three hours as of 5 p.m. EDT, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. La Guardia Airport also experienced delays in arrival and departure flights.

Philadelphia already surpassed a daily rainfall record and is experiencing its wettest day in March since 1872, with 3.06 inches of rain, according to National Weather Service.

Elsewhere, a fast-moving storm is dumped snow across parts of northern New England. More than 30 million people from the northern Rockies and Upper Midwest through the central Great Lakes into New England were under winter alerts.

Light to moderate snow was expected for the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes, where 2 to 7 inches will fall. In the northern New England area, snow as high as 12 to 18 inches is expected.

The Maine Emergency Management Agency said the storm could bring the largest snowfall of the season and urged motorists to use caution.

""Mixed precipitation in some areas will make for especially hazardous travel conditions,"" the agency said in a post on X. ""Check your local forecast for conditions.""

In the Twin Cities area, the storm could bring more than 12 inches. Combined with a 2.9-inch accumulation from a ""teaser"" snowstorm Thursday night and Friday morning, snow totals could exceed the 14.3 inches that had fallen in the previous season.

Meanwhile, a storm behind it swept down the California coast as it moved east, bringing ½ an inch to 1 inch of rain to the Bay Area. More than 6 inches of snow was also recorded in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, with the Heavenly Lake Tahoe resort reporting 10 inches of fresh powder Saturday morning.

In Oxnard, a city along the coast northwest of Los Angeles, a reading of .59 inches of rain set its modern record for rain recorded on this date. Same for Lancaster, a high desert city in Los Angeles County, which measured .53 inches of rain.

Orange and San Diego counties posted mostly smaller fractions of an inch of rain by the time the bulk of the storm passed Saturday evening.

The same front was moving east and forecast to bring ""heavy snow and strong winds, and possible blizzard conditions to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday morning,"" the National Weather Service said in a forecast discussion.

""It's time for Russia to give the West a nuclear reminder.

Washington is waging a proxy war in a bid to inflict a 'strategic defeat' on Moscow and a tougher response to this is needed.""

https://www.rt.com/russia/594811-dmitry-trenin-nuclear-arsenal/

It is extraordinary to me that Putin wasted his opportunity to show the idiot West the consequence of ignoring Russian concerns and giving an insulting cold shoulder to the Kremlin's push for a mutual security agreement that would curtail the American neoconservative agenda for war.

Putin's intervention in Ukraine should have been decisive. The war should have been over in a week, with Zelensky and his entire government hung as war criminals, with Kharkiv, Odessa, and all territory east of the Dnieper River being reincorporated into Russia.

Western Ukraine should have been occupied and a wall built isolating the territory from Europe and preventing any entry unsupervised by Russia.

The swiftness and completeness of the conquest would have sent the fear of God into NATO and Washington. Mess with Russia and this is the consequence. If Putin had acted appropriately, the world would be on its way to a peaceful existence.

If Putin had acted as he should have, there would be no reason for Dmitry Trenin to try to find a way to restore Western respect for Russia's military capability.

Putin's failure to fight a war as wars must be fought is the reason we are on the road to Armageddon.

Only Putin can get us off this road. He can surrender to the West, or he can show the West the consequences of its stupidity.

Here's how you can snag some pictures of the event without ruining your equipment.

As the 2024 solar eclipse approaches, you may be interested in capturing this rare astronomical event through photography. The eclipse offers a unique opportunity to witness the moon briefly blocking the sun -- and if you're in the path of totality, it's even more stunning.

If you love astronomy, capturing a solar eclipse photo is the perfect way to remember such a rare event. All you'll need is a few tools at your disposal and a little bit of practice.

We're going to lead with this, though. You can use your iPhone with some added gear, but you probably don't want to.

The first thing you'll want to do before you even think about taking up solar photography is get yourself a set of ISO 12312-2-certified solar viewing glasses. This is non-optional.

According to the National Institutes of Health, viewing the sun without eye protection can result in solar retinopathy, in which the retina is burned and even potentially scarred. While this is only a temporary -- and very painful -- experience for many, it can result in permanent vision loss.

Fortunately, there's no shortage of certified safe solar viewing glasses available on the Internet, so you should definitely pick up a pair -- or several!

As tempting as it may be to take your favorite camera out and point it directly at the sun, we suggest you don't do that. Cameras comprise an array of delicate sensors, many of which can be easily damaged or destroyed by the sun.

Fortunately, solar filters are available for your camera. Which filter you'll need depends on your camera lens, so we suggest doing some research.

Once you have the appropriate filter, try to get outside a few sunny days before the eclipse and begin practicing your skills.

NASA suggests DSLR photographers start with a fixed aperture of f/8 to f/16 and trying shutter speeds between 1/1000 and 1/4 seconds to see what works best for your camera.

Once totality hits -- if you're lucky enough to be in the path -- you can remove your filter and shoot without it. Totality only lasts a few minutes, so you'll want to be prepared. Once it's over, your solar filter goes right back on.

If your goal is to take some award-winning photos of the eclipse with your iPhone, you'll want to temper your expectations. If you've ever tried to take a picture of the moon, only to be disappointed at the tiny white blob on your screen, you already know what will probably happen when you photograph the sun.

That doesn't mean that you should give up your dreams of capturing the eclipse on April 8 As NASA points out, there are a couple of routes you can take.

Like many things, it's really up to how much time and money you're willing to invest.

The first option is to focus less on the sun and more on the day's activities. NASA suggests setting up your phone on a tripod and taking a time-lapse of the eclipse. This is a great way to capture the otherworldly feel of the eclipse without needing any fancy extras.

Shadows, too, do something interesting during the eclipse, and capturing those can lead to some great photographs.

Of course, there's still a chance you'll want to photograph the sun directly. If so, you'll need to pick up three items.

The first is a zoom lens attachment in the 12x to 18x range -- these are usually marketed as the type of lenses birders use for photographing wildlife. Digital zoom isn't going to cut it when photographing the sun, so this buy is non-optional.

If you're looking for a lens to get you started, Apexel offers an 18x 4-in-1 Telephoto lens kit that includes a couple of extra lenses and a tripod for $30.99.

If you want to go with even more zoom, Apexel offers a 20-40x telephoto lens kit that includes a tripod and universal phone mount and it's available for $45.99.

The second item you'll want to grab is a solar filter for your lens. Not every zoom lens for the iPhone has swappable filters, but some do. If yours doesn't, you can get a filter you simply hold before the lens, which can work in a pinch.

The last item is a tripod. When working so zoomed in, any bump or jostle you make will ruin what could have been a great photo. We suggest snagging a tripod that allows for a fair amount of fine-tuning so you can set up the perfect shot without much issue.

Once you've got those items, it's time to practice. We suggest practicing solar and lunar photography a few days before the eclipse as you'll only have a few minutes to snag your shot.

When photographing the solar eclipse, you can certainly use Apple's built-in Camera app. However, we suggest something more like Halide, which gives you easier access to settings you'll need to retool to get the perfect shot.

Practice makes perfect! Don't wait until the day of the eclipse to begin honing your new skills. It's always a smart idea to practice using the equipment, settings, and apps you plan to use on that day.

Don't limit yourself to only photographing the sun. Some of the most striking solar photography you'll see after the eclipse won't even center the eclipse itself. Otherworldly shadows and awed onlookers can make for fantastic subjects for photos.",appleinsider.com,news,AppleInsider,,0.1843137254901961,448979780,1,https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/58879-120068-solar-eclipse-partial-xl.jpg,eng-9413446

Russia launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack which also targeted the Ukraine's capital. This is Russia's third strike on Ukraine in last four days, targeting Kyiv for the second time.

""There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,"" Lviv's regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's energy ministry said equipment in the facilities caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear if they were talking about the same facility.

The energy ministry said Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on Sunday after attacks on the energy system.

Meanwhile, Poland also confirmed a breach of its airspace in early hours by Russian cruise missile targeting town in western Ukraine.

""On March 24 at 4:23 a.m. (0323 GMT), there was a violation of Polish airspace by one of the cruise missiles launched overnight by long-range aviation of the Russian Federation,"" the armed forces of Poland said in a post on X.

Poland's army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told that the missile travelled about 2 km (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.

Meanwhile Poland said that it would demand an explanation from Moscow. Foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement that, ""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems.""

Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia's presidential election.

Notably, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to deflect responsibility onto Kyiv for the tragic Moscow concert hall attack, which claimed the lives of 133 individuals.

""What happened yesterday in Moscow is obvious: Putin and the other scum are just trying to blame it on someone else,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy's remarks came in response to Putin's assertion that the suspects in the attack were fleeing towards Ukraine.

The party's request was turned down in view of the ""law and order situation"". DC Memon stated that the party had already violated NOCs (no objection certificates) issued on earlier occasions.

Two days prior, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq instructed the capital's Deputy Commissioner to address the issue and submit a report accordingly, as per The Express Tribune.

The request for permission for a public gathering on either March 23 or 30, at Parade Ground, F9 Park, or D Chowk at 10 pm, was made by the regional president of the former ruling party, Amir Masood Mughal.

According to The Express Tribune, the secretary of interior, chief commissioner, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner, and SSP operations were addressed in the application.

It demanded the law enforcement agencies refrain from blocking the routes to the venue and abstain from arresting or baton-charging party supporters.

The PTI submitted formal written requests to the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner on March 15 and 18 to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but received no response until March 21.

Later, Imran's party approached the court after alleging that the district administration was unresponsive to their request, therefore, the court should issue directions in this regard.

The PTI also faced similar rejections earlier, as the Rawalpindi District Administration declined the party's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh on February 5, right before the crucial general elections.

District Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema rejected the PTI's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh, saying that it was not possible to allow the party to hold a rally in the city as it might affect the law and order situation.

The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.

""We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.

AI runs on data

Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:

AI is everywhere and machine learning and AI growth has just exploded. There's lots of theories, lots of views on how AI will manifest itself, how it'll be deployed. But the one thing, the one plain truth is the only way AI can be delivered is through physical data infrastructure on the ground. And what that means is data centers and lots of them.

AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.

The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.

Building a leading data center platform

Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.

The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:

Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.

On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.

A high-powered growth driver

Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.

This week saw the release of a new generation of AI chip and software by Nvidia, which powers AI models. Blackwell is the name of the newest generation of AI graphics processors. The GB200, the company's debut chip, is scheduled to arrive later this year. Nvidia is luring new orders with the promise of more powerful chips. For instance, businesses and software developers are still frantically trying to obtain the most recent generation of ""Hopper"" H100s and related chips. Here are three reasons why this chip will spur demand in the market:

At present the global AI market is seeing a downturn. Analysts ascribed the decline to the impact of US sanctions on China, the meek global chip market, which is clearing excess inventory, and China's feeble economic rebound. It's interesting to note that domestic chip production decreased despite the restrictions and the drop in imports. However, with Nvidia's new chip, the company can easily overcome these issues.

The market for AI technology is enormous; it will likely reach a value of over 1.8 trillion dollars by 2030, up from a projected 200 billion dollars in 2023. The new chip developed by the company will mint good revenue numbers out of this expected growth itself.

With Nvidia's new software, applications on any of the company's GPUs -- even the older models that might be more appropriate for deployment but not AI development -- will operate more smoothly. Nvidia releases an update to its GPU architecture every two years, which unlocks significant performance gains. The company's 2022-announced Hopper architecture, which powers chips like the H100, served as the training ground for a large number of the AI models that have been made public in the last year.

With 20 petaflops of AI capability compared to 4 petaflops for the H100, Nvidia claims that Blackwell-based processors, such as the GB200, offer a significant performance boost for AI firms. AI companies will be able to train more complex and large-scale models because to this increased processing capability.",coingape.com,news,Coingape,Nausheen Thusoo,0.09019607843137245,448979611,1,https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/17-facts-about-nvidia-1689447088-e1710421517206.jpg,eng-9421528

The NDTV's 'Indian Of the Year' award programme on Saturday saw the biggest faces from realms like politics, business, film and sports fraternity getting felicitated with the award in the presence of numerous esteemed guests and illustrious personalities.

Many distinguished women achievers made for a special highlight of the event as they walked away with NDTV's 'Indian of the Year' award.

Among the noted ones Union Minister Smriti Irani, tennis star Sania Mirza, Suvarna Raj, Squadron Leader Nikita Malhotra, ISRO scientists, and members of the women's cricket team were feted with the honour.

While a couple of them are well-known and have proven records of achievements in their respective fields, para-athlete Suvarna Raj grabbed everyone's attention.

Suvarna, a National Award winner, has represented the country at many global events.

While speaking to NDTV, she recalled the harsh times and elated over the honour, said: ""It took me 33 years to prove myself.""

Squadron Leader Malhotra was conferred with the Vayu Sena medal on the 75th Republic Day. She was also part of Tangail formation during the Republic Day flypast over Kartavya Path.

Notably, the honour for women achievers comes close on the heels of Parliament passing the women's reservation bill, thus making it a rightful ode to the rising women's power.

NDTV's 'Indian Of The Year' awards recognised distinguished visionaries, political figures, sports icons, and entertainers who have contributed immensely to the development of India. The initiative aimed to honour exceptional Indians from various fields. The awards recognised those who dared to think ahead, displayed valour to be different from the league, and eventually redefined the meaning of 'being a true Indian'.",socialnews.xyz,news,Social News XYZ,,0.6000000000000001,448979608,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24/202403243136690-scaled.jpg?fit=2048%2C2560&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1711283435,

Russia started a day of national mourning for the victims of the terrorist attack in Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk. EPA-Yonhap

Several senior members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime have called for the country to bring back the death penalty following Friday's attack on a Moscow concert hall.

Critics have sounded the alarm over the demand, including due to Russia's broad use of counter-terrorism and anti-extremist laws to target Kremlin opponents and supporters of Ukraine.

Russia has had a moratorium on capital punishment since the 1990s but calls are growing in the Putin camp to lift it in the wake of the deadliest attack in the country for two decades.

""Now a lot of questions are being asked about the death penalty,"" Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the ruling United Russia party in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday.

""This topic will definitely be deeply, professionally and substantively worked out. A decision will be made that will meet the mood and expectations of our society,"" Vasilyev said in a video statement.

More than 130 people were killed when gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall concert hall on Friday, shooting spectators before setting the building on fire.

""It is necessary to bring back the death penalty when it comes to terrorism and murder,"" said Yury Afonin, deputy head of the State Duma's security committee, said on Saturday.

Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council, and Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin -- two close Putin allies -- also called for the ""terrorists"" to be ""destroyed"" following the attack.

""Terrorists only understand retaliatory terror ... death for death,"" Medvedev said on Friday in a post on Telegram.

The move was also backed by the heads of two other pro-Putin parties in Russia's parliament.

Critics have voiced alarm over the plans, including because of Russia's broad use of counter-terrorism and anti-extremist laws, which have been used to target Kremlin opponents and supporters of Ukraine.

Authorities opened a record 143 ""terror""-related criminal cases in 2023, according to the independent Mediazona news site -- up from fewer than 20 a year prior to 2018.

Earlier this month, Russia's financial monitoring watchdog added the ""international LGBT movement"" to its ""terrorists and extremists"" blacklist.

Alexei Navalny, Putin's most strident critic of the last decade, who died in an Arctic prison colony last month, was among those serving years in prison on ""extremism"" charges.

""If we allow the death penalty for terrorism, do you realise how many people the system would kill?"", women's rights campaigner Alyona Popova said Saturday on Telegram.

""How many people are in prison right now ... who are not terrorists in any way?"" she added.

This downward trend was influenced by forecasts of milder weather, abundant gas storage, and low gas flows to LNG export plants, primarily due to service outages at Freeport LNG's Texas plant. Freeport LNG announced that two of its three liquefaction trains would be offline until May for testing and repairs. Consequently, front-month gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped to their lowest close since March 15.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that current gas stockpiles were about 41% above typical levels. This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market. In the coming week, prices are expected to remain under pressure, reflecting these mixed influences.

Do you spend your free moments obsessing over every little detail from Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi epic? Then The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, a behind-the-scenes look at the film from Insight Editions, will be right up your alley.

Written by Dune producer Tanya Lapointe and Stefanie Broos, The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two dives headfirst into the making of the film. Gorgeous spreads of concept art and photography abound, as well as interviewers with the craftspeople who brought the planets of Arrakis, Giedi Prime, and more to life. Not only will you get to bask in the visual splendor of Dune: Part Two, but you'll learn a lot more about the movie as well. I've laid out five of my favorite tidbits from The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two below, but there are so, so many more where these came from.

""The Art and Soul of 'Dune: Part Two'"" Buy On Amazon↗ 1. Dune: Part Two features a real-life eclipse.

Dune: Part Two's opening fight scene between the Fremen and Harkonnen soldiers takes place during a solar eclipse, making for some instantly memorable orange-tinted visuals courtesy of cinematographer Greig Fraser. In an exciting twist of fate, the cast and crew of Dune: Part Two witnessed an actual partial solar eclipse on October 25, 2022. The camera crew was able to capture footage of the eclipse, which wound up in the final cut of the film. To stay true to the lore that Arrakis has two moons, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and his team added a second moon to the eclipse footage.

2. Inspiration for Harkonnen architecture came from unique places -- including septic tanks.

In my review of Dune: Part Two, I praised the Harkonnens' insectoid architecture as one of the visual highlights of the film. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two confirms the insect inspirations when it comes to all things Harkonnen, but it also singles out one of production designer Patrice Vermette's most surprising points of reference: septic tanks. ""Black, shiny, and new,"" Vermette tells Villeneuve.

The septic tank is just one of many fascinating references for the design teams discussed in the book. Others include the Sardaukar's Excalibur-inspired swords and the Harkonnens' inkblot-esque ""negative fireworks.""

3. The baby sandworm was a practical effect.

The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two contains no shortage of sandworm goodness, including a pages-long discussion of how the film brought Paul's first worm ride to life. Also of note is the section on the baby worm that lives in the Southern Fremen's Maker's Temple. While a CG worm was a possibility, Dune: Part Two ended up using practical effects, including a worm puppet.

According to The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, the shot of the baby worm moving through the sand was the biggest challenge for the film's special effects team. They built the worm out of eight balls connected by a chain, then ran it under the sand on two sets of tracks -- one for its circular movements, one for its straight path towards the Maker Keeper (Alison Halstead).

4. Feyd-Rautha's gladiator fight was partly inspired by bullfighting.

My favorite side characters in Dune: Part Two are the black-clothed Harkonnen servants with distinct curved headdresses who assist Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in the fighting arena on Giedi Prime. They have their roots in Frank Herbert's Dune as Feyd's barb-men, but Lapointe and Broos write that Villeneuve specifically wanted picador silhouettes for these characters, ""just like in bullfighting.""

The bullfighting imagery enhances the showmanship and cruelty of the Harkonnens' war games, with the remaining House Atreides fighter Lanville (Roger Yuan) taking on the role of a doomed bull. It also ties back to House Atreides' deeper connection to bullfighting. As discussed in the first Dune, Paul's (Timothée Chalamet) grandfather fought bulls for sport, even dying in a bullfight. Later, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) walks into a treacherous ""arena"" of his own on Arrakis, and Paul will take on a dangerous, unpredictable enemy in his duel with Feyd. It seems the Atreides can never fully escape bullfighting, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense.

5. Which deleted scenes didn't make it into Dune: Part Two?

Villeneuve has said he won't release any deleted scenes from Dune: Part Two, which include sequences featuring Stephen McKinley Henderson's Thufir Hawat as well as Tim Blake Nelson in an undisclosed role (which some speculate was Count Fenring). The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also hints at other moments that were cut from the final film.

One such moment came after the funereal ceremony for Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), during which the Fremen take the water from his body. In an early version of the scene, Lapointe and Broos write, Paul receives water rings representing Jamis' water -- a key part of Fremen culture in the novel. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also showcases artwork of the water rings, along with other props used in the ceremony.

Poland said the missile was part of a Russian bombardment of targets in Ukraine as Moscow steps up its attacks on its western neighbour.

""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems,"" foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement.

Following a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine by Russia, Poland activated ""all air defence systems, all air force systems"", the country's Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

He said that the missile would have been shot down ""had there been any indication it was heading for a target on Polish territory"".

The army said the missile, which was travelling at almost 800 kilometres per hour (500 mph) around 400 metres (1,300 feet) above the ground, had crossed about two kilometres over the border into Poland.

""Polish airspace was breached by one of the cruise missiles fired in the night by the air forces... of the Russian Federation,"" the army wrote on X.

""The object flew through Polish airspace above the village of Oserdow (Lublin province) and stayed for 39 seconds,"" the statement said, adding that it was tracked by military radar throughout its flight.

""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on permanent alert to ensure the security of Polish airspace,"" the army said.

A similar incident occurred on December 29, 2023, when a Russian missile penetrated Polish airspace for several minutes before returning to Ukraine.

In November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, close to the Ukrainian border.

The study, published in Physical Review Letters, outlines a virtual broadcasting map that creates correlated copies ""virtually."" Through a series of four theorems, the researchers establish the viability of this map, which allows for the creation of correlated copies of quantum states over time.

Further, the researchers demonstrate the robustness of the canonical framework, prove its physical approximation to the universal cloner, and detail how the map can be implemented.

Virtual quantum broadcasting promises to impact many fields of quantum information processing by leveraging time-based correlations, thereby avoiding the limitations imposed by the no-cloning theorem.

Quantum mechanics, while incredibly powerful, is built such that it prevents information from being replicated or copied. A quantum state encapsulates all the relevant information in the system and collapses or changes to one of the possible outcomes of the measurement when measured or observed.

It means that we can't copy the state since it needs to be measured to be able to do that. This principle is known as the no-cloning theorem. In simpler terms, you can't just copy and paste quantum information as you would with classical data.

This limitation poses a significant obstacle for quantum communication systems that rely on efficiently being able to transmit and reproduce quantum information.

The research team consisted of Prof. Arthur Parzygnat from MIT, Prof. James Fullwood from Hainan University, Prof. Francesco Buscemi from Nagoya University, and Prof. Giulio Chiribella from the University of Hong Kong, who explained their motivation to Phys.org.

They were motivated by this problem presented by the no-cloning theorem. Their aim was to study the evolution of quantum states over time and understand what ""correlation does not imply causation"" meant for purely quantum states.

""Our way around this was to introduce virtual quantum broadcasting channels, which, though not genuine physical processes, have many important applications in quantum information processing,"" explained Prof. Parzygnat.

Unlike traditional copying methods, which are prohibited by the no-cloning theorem, these virtual broadcasting channels or maps operate virtually, meaning they don't involve direct physical replication.

Instead, the map establishes correlations between different instances of a quantum state, effectively allowing for the transmission of information without violating the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

The virtual broadcasting map is unique and satisfies three simple axioms, which the researchers lay out in theorem 1. The axioms governing the virtual broadcasting map ensure consistency under changes in:

These are the basic requirements of a virtual broadcasting map.

The researchers further prove (in theorem 2) that a physical approximation of such a map could be created using a universal cloner, a device that can make the most faithful copies of an arbitrary quantum state possible.

Next, the researchers show how the broadcasting map can be achieved by decomposition (theorem 3). It establishes that the map can be broken down into two operations:

Finally, they establish (in theorem 4) the equivalence between the action of a time evolution function and the action of the virtual broadcasting map on any arbitrary state. This implies that the virtual broadcasting map behaves like a time operation, allowing for the creation of correlated virtual copies of quantum states over time.

""The most appealing feature of this work is that the map is uniquely characterized by a simple set of natural requirements. That's why we call it canonical. Such a unique property, in turn, seems to point to a whole new part of quantum theory, i.e., its time-like structure, which is still largely unexplored,"" explained Prof. Buscemi.

By establishing a virtual quantum broadcasting theorem, the researchers have brought forth a host of new possibilities for quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum cryptography.

""One avenue I find particularly interesting, and which I am currently working on with Prof. Parzygnat, is how a virtually broadcast state can potentially encode the measurement statistics of two timelike separated measurements in a given laboratory,"" said Prof. Fullwood.

This phenomenon suggests that the virtually broadcast state, as outlined, captures not just the expectation values but also the probabilities of joint measurement outcomes.

This supports the interpretation of virtual broadcasting as a spatiotemporal process that mirrors the flow of quantum information over time, ""similar to how spacetime encapsulates the evolution of space over time,"" added Prof. Fullwood.

The researchers also point out that virtual broadcasting reveals the hidden structure behind many quantum information technologies. Prof. Chiribella explains this with an example in the context of quantum communication, ""A natural way for an eavesdropper to tap into a quantum communication channel is to attempt to copy quantum states.""

""As it turns out, the best approximate way to copy the quantum state is to realize a physical approximation of our virtual broadcasting.""

This understanding can enhance security measures in quantum communication by offering insights into potential eavesdropping techniques and their countermeasures.

The researchers point to us entering a new area of quantum theory previously considered unorthodox or off-limits, such as the direct measurement of accuracy in quantum devices, as allowed by the virtual broadcasting map.

""Perhaps the answers to many fundamental questions can be found here,"" concluded Prof. Buscemi.",phys.org,news,Phys.org,,0.07450980392156858,448978920,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/beyond-cloning-harness.jpg,eng-9417898

""For the current day, electricity imports are forecast at 14,900 megawatt hour (Mwh). No exports are expected,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Ukraine imported 3,300 Mwh a day before the attack on March 22, with exports of 2,148 Mwh.

Generating and transmission facilities were attacked by Russia on Friday, causing significant blackouts in many regions. Energy facilities in three Ukrainian regions were also attacked and on this Sunday morning.

""Losses (of Friday's attack) have already been assessed and the DTEK group has lost 50% of its generating capacity, we can say this information officially,"" the head of Yasno distribution firm Serhiy Kovalenko told a national television.

He gave no more details. DTEK, Ukraine's largest private power generating company, has not commented on this information yet.

Kovalenko said Russians attacked two parts of the energy system - generation and distribution, hitting both thermal and hydropower plants.

""The enemy hit hard at grid nodes and transformers,"" he said.

The ministry said that on Sunday Russians had attempted to hit a critical energy infrastructure facility in the Lviv region.

""Equipment caught fire and the facility was de-energised. There were no casualties. The consequences are being assessed,"" the ministry said.

It said that as a result power lines in the Kyiv region were damaged and 1,400 households in two settlements had lost power.

Now normally, one wouldn't dwell too long on what didn't happen in politics, or even what almost happened. But on two occasions this past week, two opposition parties seemed determined to use votes in the Commons to show Justin Trudeau's Liberals how precariously they remain in power.

It's even more remarkable when you consider this was the only week this month that the Commons would be sitting. Of all the things MPs were determined to cram into it, we ended up with not one but two brushes with Liberal defeat.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

First, there was the New Democrats' motion on the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. This was a sweeping, nine-point list of demands placed before the Liberal government, including an immediate ceasefire call and unilateral recognition of Palestine as a state.

For reasons still unclear, this motion ignited a flurry of intense, down-to-the-wire negotiations between the Liberals and the NDP, which ultimately resulted in a much-watered-down motion and lingering confusion on what it all meant for foreign policy.

As Andrew Phillips, my fellow columnist here at the Star observed, the Liberals would have been better advised to just skip all the negotiating and let the NDP motion fail -- as many opposition motions do. Phillips and others speculated that Liberals were worried about just how many of their own MPs would go along with the motion, putting schisms within the governing caucus on display.

That's no doubt true, and good insight into how vulnerable things must be feeling right now within Liberal ranks, especially on the Israeli-Hamas conflict.

No sooner had the Liberals got past this vote when the Conservatives, for much the same motives, forced a vote on carbon pricing toward the end of the week. There was little chance of this non-confidence vote succeeding -- all parties except the Conservatives are in favour of carbon pricing.

But Pierre Poilievre and his team were trying to whip up Liberal divisions that stretch beyond Trudeau's caucus in Ottawa, and out to provinces like Ontario and Newfoundland, where Liberals have also soured on the federal carbon levy.

Newfoundland Premier Andrew Furey formally asked last week for Trudeau to press pause on the carbon levy, while new Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said that she would not sign onto the federal carbon pricing deal if she becomes premier.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

The non-confidence vote failed resoundingly on Thursday night, with numbers almost identical to the NDP motion on Monday night. The motion on the Middle East received 204 votes in favour, 117 votes against. The Conservatives' bid to hold a carbon-price election failed with 204 votes against, 116 in favour.

Two different votes on two very different things -- one domestically focused, one international. But both highlighted some serious, even existential, divisions within the Liberal universe -- the Middle East motion revolving around schisms within Trudeau's caucus, the carbon-levy election focused on trouble with Trudeau's provincial Liberal allies.

Perhaps it's not surprising that in times that are tense for Canadians, the mood in the Commons would be tense, too. Parliament, at its best and even its worst, should be a mirror of the nation. When I asked Trudeau about tough times in an interview earlier this year, he replied, ""Define 'tough times,' because that sounds like Monday to me.""

This was a week of Mondays, the prime minister would probably agree. One of the many questions left over from this week, however, is whether this is going to be business as usual for the remaining life of this Parliament.

At another point in this event-jammed week, the government unveiled next steps for electoral reform, which it hopes will be in place before the next election. As with a number of government announcements lately, it wasn't a full-fledged change -- more of a plan to change, pending further negotiation and deliberation. Pharmacare was unveiled a few weeks ago in the same way.

During that news conference, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said a couple of times that the next election was most likely a year or more away, in the fall of 2025 if the Liberals can hold it together that long.

Those two votes in the Commons this week showed what the Liberals need to do to hold things together: negotiate with the NDP, keep a restive caucus from revolt, resist Conservative efforts to drive further wedges between Ottawa and the country outside Parliament Hill.

Many have called data the new oil. The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.

""We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (BIPC -0.78%) (BIP -1.24%) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.

Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:

AI is everywhere and machine learning and AI growth has just exploded. There's lots of theories, lots of views on how AI will manifest itself, how it'll be deployed. But the one thing, the one plain truth is the only way AI can be delivered is through physical data infrastructure on the ground. And what that means is data centers and lots of them.

AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA 3.12%). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.

The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.

Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.

The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:

Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.

On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.

Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Matt DiLallo,0.3019607843137255,448978581,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770121/artificial-intelligence-ai-robot-big-data-bull-market-stock-chart-getty.jpg,

The party's request was turned down in view of the ""law and order situation"". DC Memon stated that the party had already violated NOCs (no objection certificates) issued on earlier occasions.

Two days prior, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq instructed the capital's Deputy Commissioner to address the issue and submit a report accordingly, as per The Express Tribune.

The request for permission for a public gathering on either March 23 or 30, at Parade Ground, F9 Park, or D Chowk at 10 pm, was made by the regional president of the former ruling party, Amir Masood Mughal.

According to The Express Tribune, the secretary of interior, chief commissioner, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner, and SSP operations were addressed in the application.

It demanded the law enforcement agencies refrain from blocking the routes to the venue and abstain from arresting or baton-charging party supporters.

The PTI submitted formal written requests to the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner on March 15 and 18 to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but received no response until March 21.

Later, Imran's party approached the court after alleging that the district administration was unresponsive to their request, therefore, the court should issue directions in this regard.

The PTI also faced similar rejections earlier, as the Rawalpindi District Administration declined the party's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh on February 5, right before the crucial general elections.

District Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema rejected the PTI's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh, saying that it was not possible to allow the party to hold a rally in the city as it might affect the law and order situation.

PCPC said its 135-megawatt circulating fluidized bed coal (CFBC) plant would not be able to return online on March 30, but assured it would make available replacement power at no additional cost to customers.

""Until March 30, it will be status quo since that is the scheduled maintenance of PCPC. On March 31, CNP3 will be completed, so replacement power for PCPC can be sourced outside of Panay island,"" DOE Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said.

The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME), where a vast amount of material is dumped outwards into space within a short span of time by the Sun. The Sun violently dumped the material from its atmosphere in all directions, resulting in a halo CME, which was not a full halo CME because there were gaps in the outburst.

During such violent outbursts, a portion of the magnetic field of the Sun is carried outwards through space. When interacting with the geomagnetic field of the Earth, the CME can cause perturbations, resulting in geomagnetic storming that can last for days, even weeks. First, on 23 March, 2024 a solar radiation storm was observed, disrupting high frequency radio communications on the sunlit side of the Earth. This was because of a minor to moderate solar storm, accompanied by a shower of energetic protons.

Then the plasma from the Sun, that moves slower than the light, washed over the Earth, resulting in a moderate geomagnetic storm. The intensity of the geomagnetic storm varies over the course of the event, which can cause fluctuations in power grids, and potentially impact satellite operations. The geomagnetic storming also resulted in more spectacular displays of polar lights, or aurorae. The geomagnetic storming is expected to continue through 24 and 25 March.

Solar flares are measured on a scale that goes through the letters A, B, C, M and X. These letters are accompanied by a finer-grained scale that goes between 0 and 9.9. Each of the letters indicate solar flares ten times more powerful than the previous letter. The X-class flares are the most powerful, with no upper limit on the numbers. A, B and C class flares are considered closed to background level activity on the Sun.",news9live.com,news,News9live,Aditya Madanapalle,-0.08235294117647063,448978384,1,https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Halo-CME-1.jpg,

A Helping Paw was established in 2022 by Tyesha Muncaster from her home in Ashington, after she was shocked by the response of people in need when she offered kitten food on Facebook. Now, Tyesha has brought A Helping Paw to the Farplace Animal Rescue charity shop in Whitley Bay, with the charity now supporting more than 300 pets.

Though the majority are cats and dogs, some have sought help for smaller pets such as guinea pigs and rabbits. Since the expansion, Tyesha has even provided help for a chinchilla.

She told ChronicleLive: ""The demand has been ridiculous to be honest, we've been really, really busy. It's absolutely non-stop.

""We're getting a lot from Wallsend and North Shields, but people are coming from all over really. It makes us happy that we can feed more pets, but it's sad that it's needed.""

Tyesha says that the cost of living crisis means that people are having to choose between themselves and their pets. One service user had confided in her that the support from A Helping Paw meant he could put money in his electricity meter.

She added: ""It's a lot of sacrifices that people are having to make if we weren't able to help them with their pets.""

Previously the 25-year-old, who operates the pet food bank alongside her full-time job as an SEO strategist, had been a one-woman show, delivering pet parcels across Northumberland in her Vauxhall Corsa. However, that was unsustainable and the charity has now become a collection-only service.

Tyesha has been able to continue the service due to donations of pet food from the community and cash donations, which can be placed here. Cash donations help Tyesha buy pet food when stocks are running low and also supplies specialist food for pets who may have allergies or dietary needs.

The charity has grown rapidly in two years, and while Tyesha had originally considered expanding the service across the whole country, she is concentrating on the North East for now.

""But we will continue to expand as long as we're able to, and as long as people need us to.""

The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.

""We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.

Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:

AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.

The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.

Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.

The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:

Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.

On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.

Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.

Summary The Rings of Power season 1 faced issues in 2022, but season 2 can avoid them with proper timing. The show sits in a unique place in Tolkien's universe, attracting fans despite canon discrepancies. Release overlap with House of the Dragon impacted comparisons; The Rings of Power season 2 should time its premiere wisely. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 1 ran into an issue when it aired in 2022, but the coming installment could avoid the problem this time around. The Amazon Lord of the Rings prequel TV show sits in an unusual place canonically, but that didn't stop fans of the franchise from watching in their droves. The impending arrival of The Rings of Power season 2 proves how successful the first set of episodes was, but it can be even more of a triumph if it takes one simple step.

The Rings of Power cast bring a version of JRR Tolkein's legendary universe to life, with events taking place centuries before the books or the movies. The show's place in The Lord of the Rings' timeline is one of the few facets that's largely agreed upon by fans. Due to The Rings of Power's restricted access to the source material for legal reasons, the canon of the show has already veered from established lore several times. Regardless, a second season is coming, and it needs to sidestep a clash with one of its biggest competitors.

Related The Rings Of Power Season 1 Ending Explained (In Detail) Rings of Power season 1's ending finally brings answers. Who is Sauron? Who fell from the sky? When will the Rings appear? Here's what we learn. The Rings Of Power Season 1's Release Date Was Too Close To House Of The Dragon's The Game of Thrones prequel's release schedule overlapped with The Rings of Power Close

The Rings of Power was one of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video in 2022, and it drew a lot of comparisons with House of the Dragon when both shows were being released. The two shared much more than a genre label, although that also contributed to them being constantly compared. As well as both prequel shows being set before established fantasy franchises, The Rings of Power season 1's release schedule almost perfectly overlapped with The House of the Dragon's.

House of the Dragon started its ten-episode run on August 21, 2022. After just two episodes of House of the Dragon, The Rings of Power released two at once on September 1, 2022. That meant that each show released an episode within a few days of the other for a notable string of weeks before both ended in October. The fact that both shows were being aired weekly only led to even more comparisons between them.

While there were fans who enjoyed both shows, The House of the Dragon was of a higher quality than The Rings of Power. So, while The House of the Dragon benefited by being made to look better by comparison, The Rings of Power suffered the opposite fate. The Lord of the Rings spinoff was a very good show in its own right, but it was hurt by being released almost simultaneously with a direct competitor.

The Rings Of Power Season 2 Must Avoid The Release Mistake That Hurt Season 1 The two fantasy shows both need room to breathe Close

Although there were undeniable similarities between The Rings of Power and House of the Dragon, the two shows were also different in key ways. The disparities in the shows were partially overlooked due to the similar release schedules, although they were thankfully on separate streaming platforms. The House of the Dragon season 2 release month has already been revealed to be June 2024. However, The Rings of Power season 2 has yet to receive an official release date.

Although there were undeniable similarities between The Rings of Power and House of the Dragon , the two shows were also different in key ways.

That being said, The Rings of Power season 2 release window has been revealed to fall somewhere within 2024. So, it's possible there could be a similar clash with the Game of Thrones prequel show. The rivalry between the two properties is already notable. Hopefully, Amazon will learn from the mistakes of the past and won't release The Rings of Power alongside House of the Dragon again.

When The Rings Of Power Season 2 Should Premiere On Amazon The Lord of the Rings show should wait until at least Fall 2024 to debut its second season Close

The Rings of Power season 2 needs to avoid a summer release window so the fantasy market doesn't become saturated for another stretch of weeks. Thankfully, there's an easy way they can do this. Amazon should hold back on airing any of The Rings of Power season 2 until House of the Dragon has finished its weekly releases of its second season. Doing so would help reduce any harmful comparisons between the two shows.

Related House Of The Dragon And The Rings Of Power: 10 Biggest Similarities With similar underlying themes, Prime Video's The Rings of Power and HBO's House of the Dragon are similar fantasy stories in many respects.

House of the Dragon season 2 will be two episodes shorter than its predecessor, consisting of just eight episodes. So, depending on when the first episode airs in June, the finale will land on Max in mid-late August 2024. This removes summer as a viable option for The Lords of the Rings' prequel story to continue. Instead, The Rings of Power should begin in the fall or even winter.

The Rings of Power season 1 is available to stream now on Prime Video. House of the Dragon season 1 is on Max.

Set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power will explore a time in the franchise where kingdoms rose and fell, where The One Ring itself was forged and tells the tale of the rise of the greatest foe in the Lord of the Rings Franchise, the Dark Lord Sauron. Beginning in a time of peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of familiar and new characters as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil in Middle-earth.

The third full moon of 2024 and the first of spring in the northern hemisphere, the ""Worm Moon"" -- also known as the ""Crow Moon"" and the ""Lenten Moon"" -- will move through the Earth's outer shadow in space.

As well as being an interesting astronomical event, it will set up a total solar eclipse exactly two weeks later that will be seen across North America.

We're entering 2024's first (and best) ""eclipse season,"" during which there will be two eclipses -- one of the moon by the Earth and one of the sun by the moon.

Every 173 days, for between 31 and 37 days, the moon intersects (or almost intersects) the ecliptic -- the apparent path of the sun through our daytime sky. The ecliptic is also the plane of Earth's orbit of the sun. What results is a short season during which two -- and occasionally three -- solar and lunar eclipses can occur.

In 2024, there will be two eclipse seasons each featuring two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses:

Although there is no third eclipse in 2024's second eclipse season, there so nearly is. According to timeanddate, an ""almost lunar eclipse"" will (won't!) occur on October 17 when the full ""Hunter's Moon"" just misses moving through Earth's shadow. It's a meaningless fact, visually, but it helps demonstrate how eclipse seasons work. It will miss because the moon will have been at its ascending node the day before, according to Astropixels.

The moon's orbital nodes are why there isn't a solar or lunar eclipse every month.

The moon's orbit of Earth is tilted by 5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. That guarantees that there usually isn't a solar or lunar eclipse in any given month, but it also ensures that they must happen occasionally.

For one to occur, the moon must reach its new or full phase while it crosses the ecliptic. These two places are called the ascending node and the descending node.

The moon reaches those two nodes at different times every month. It usually does so when it's not either new or full, so it isn't in a position to eclipse or be eclipsed. Only during an eclipse season does the moon arrive at, or very close to, these nodes at the perfect time to cause an eclipse. The result is a short season during which two (and sometimes three) solar and lunar eclipses can occur, one after another, two weeks apart.

Slight eclipses -- a partial solar or lunar eclipse and a penumbral lunar eclipse -- occur during eclipse season when the moon reaches a node just a few hours or a day too early or late. On these occasions, it misses its target, either eclipsing only part of the sun or moving through Earth's outer shadow.

Either the new moon is slightly above or below the sun, and the full moon is above or below Earth's shadow. Only when it reaches a node at precisely the right time does it cause a total solar eclipse or a total lunar eclipse.

That's what makes Monday, April 8, such a special day for North America -- and why you should, if possible, travel into the path of totality. Only then will you see, with your own naked eyes, the sun's majestic, spiky white corona revealed in a dark sky.",space.com,news,Space.com,,0.003921568627450966,448977788,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Usfmo8ioU38SPh8PNTGkxB-1200-80.jpg,spa-3425543

Poland said the missile was part of a Russian bombardment of targets in Ukraine as Moscow steps up its attacks on its western neighbour.

""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems,"" foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement.

Following a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine by Russia, Poland activated ""all air defence systems, all air force systems"", the country's Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

He said that the missile would have been shot down ""had there been any indication it was heading for a target on Polish territory"".

The army said the missile, which was travelling at almost 800 kilometres per hour (500 mph) around 400 metres (1,300 feet) above the ground, had crossed about two kilometres over the border into Poland.

""Polish airspace was breached by one of the cruise missiles fired in the night by the air forces... of the Russian Federation,"" the army wrote on X.

""The object flew through Polish airspace above the village of Oserdow (Lublin province) and stayed for 39 seconds,"" the statement said, adding that it was tracked by military radar throughout its flight.

""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on permanent alert to ensure the security of Polish airspace,"" the army said.

A similar incident occurred on December 29, 2023, when a Russian missile penetrated Polish airspace for several minutes before returning to Ukraine.

In November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, close to the Ukrainian border.

Before the missile was identified as Ukrainian, fears were raised that NATO -- of which Poland is a member -- would be dragged into an escalation of the conflict with Russia if its collective defence provisions were triggered.",thepeninsulaqatar.com,news,The Peninsula,,-0.3490196078431372,448977778,1,https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240324_1711281358-586.jpeg?1711281358,

The footage, which was filmed by a Chinese security agency and obtained by 60 Minutes, shows dozens of Chinese police smashing down doors and arresting almost 80 young male and female alleged cyber scammers in Fiji.

The alleged offenders are then hooded, handcuffed and sat in the middle of row upon row of Chinese cops as they are flown back to China on a charter jet.

'No matter how far away, They [criminal suspects] will be arrested,' a translation of the accompanying Chinese captions reads.

Fijian police simply watch on as the arrests were made under a controversial policing deal between Suva and Beijing, which critics claim shows the extent of China's pernicious influence in the region.

While the footage was filmed in 2017, Australian National University China specialist Graeme Smith said up to two of these types of 'rendition' exercises were happening each week.

'It's a very disturbing path because these sorts of operations [involving Chinese authorities] are happening all over the world,' Mr Smith told 60 Minutes.

'Our team estimated this is happening twice a week, every week, all over the globe, but the Pacific example is a pretty concerning one.'

Mr Smith, who first unearthed the terrifying vision, said it showed Chinese cops 'behaving as though they are in China'.

'The Fijian police are there, but only really in the background, and they are, to all intents and purposes, treating Fijian soil as Chinese soil,' Mr Smith said.

'It is absolutely a ceding of sovereignty and... a very bad precedent that was set.'

The police operation completely by-passed Fiji's own legal system and the alleged offenders were taken to China to face 'justice' in the Communist country's murky court system.

The Chinese embassy in Fiji told said 'the law enforcement and police co-operation between China and Fiji is professional, open and transparent'.

Pacific island nations, like Fiji, have found themselves at the centre of a fierce battle for influence from Australia and the US on one hand, and China on the other.

China failed to sign up 10 nations to a region-wide security treaty last year so has instead chosen to focus on striking individual deals with them.

But Fiji's prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka told 60 Minutes the South Pacific could be destabilised by China's 'unwarranted influence'.

'I understand Australia and America, and I do not fully understand China's agenda,' Mr Rabuka said.

Tibetan Plateau and deserts of Xinjiang are best spots in China to install double-sided PV panels to maximise energy output, team finds

A team of Chinese scientists has developed an artificial intelligence tool that could help to locate the best place to install double-sided solar panels, thereby filling a crucial data gap in the green energy industry.

Dual-sided panels are capable of generating more power than their single-faced counterparts. Placing them in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and other places in northwestern China could help maximise solar energy output, the researchers said.

The power-generating potential of a dual-sided photovoltaic (PV) panel depends greatly on how much diffuse solar radiation reaches its rear, the team explained in an article in the peer-reviewed Journal of Remote Sensing last month.

Under the right sunlight conditions, two-sided solar panels can produce more power than conventional ones. However they are difficult to transport and maintain, so finding the optimal location for them is crucial to ensuring the best use of resources.

China is the biggest producer of solar PV modules, accounting for around 80 per cent of the global total.

However, it lacks data that would help determine the best spots to place two-sided solar panels.

The country has just 17 radiation stations that collect data on the amount and type of “solar power” available in a given location. This includes data on direct radiation – beamed straight from the sun to the front surface of a solar panel – and diffuse radiation, which is scattered by the atmosphere and more likely to be picked up by the panel’s rear face.

The equipment at these stations requires annual adjustments and regular maintenance, resulting in considerable operating costs.

To overcome the lack of on-the-ground data, researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing and the National Tibetan Plateau Data Centre created an AI model based on sunshine data from 2,500 weather stations across China.

The AI was trained on solar radiation data – collected either via ground observation or satellite remote sensing – and surface meteorological data, to predict the amount of direct and indirect radiation at any given spot.

“In principle, this model can be applied on the global scale without additional training with local data,” the team wrote.China needs 10 times its solar and wind power to be carbon neutral, study finds

Senior author Yang Kun, a professor with the earth system science department at Tsinghua, said the lack of comprehensive radiation data meant there was little information to help the authorities and the solar industry to plan for panel installation sites.

“Now the output of the AI model supported by satellite data can inform decision-making on where and which type of panels to deploy to take full advantage of solar power,” Yang said.

Solar power accounted for close to 5 per cent of China’s electricity output in 2022.

Yang said the AI system also revealed the solar potential of remote areas of China that lack power line infrastructure, and this could inspire future research and policy planning.China creates electric power in its western deserts equal to half that in US

First author Shao Changkun, a PhD candidate at Tsinghua, said the area surrounding the Taklamakan Desert in the southwestern part of Xinjiang autonomous region, and the eastern Tibetan Plateau were ideal spots for dual-sided panels.

“Direct solar radiation is high on the high-altitude plateau where the air is thinner, while diffuse solar radiation is also substantial thanks to its complex landscape and high cloud coverage,” Shao said.

“Both sides of solar panels will receive sizeable amounts of radiation in these regions.”

The team compared their estimates with radiation data from around the world and found that their AI model had high accuracy, Shao said, adding that combining its inputs with meteorological data from other countries could help the system be used for solar radiation projections globally.

Yang added that the data could also be applied in other fields such as agriculture, as plants have been found to carry out photosynthesis more efficiently under diffuse light conditions.",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.3960784313725489,448977755,1,,

Hydro.

Last year, amid low water conditions at the Arrow Lakes Generating Station, the station did not generate any power. The generating station requires a minimum operating water level between approximately 425.8 metres (1,397 feet) to 427.3 m. (1,402 ft) in the Arrow Lakes reservoir.

Residents of the reservoir area watched water levels drop last summer, sinking from 438.91 m in July down to 426.72 m by the end of August. Debris and stranded fish, as well as quicksand, have been exposed as the shoreline grew. By the end of November the water level dropped to 420.6 m.

As of mid-March, provincial figures show the West Kootenay snowpack is 28 per cent below normal throughout the region.

This could point to a dip or a halt in power production on the lake.

""The power production associated with the station, however, is quite small relative to the combined generation from Mica and Revelstoke Generation Stations ... and does not materially affect B.C. Hydro's ability to provide reliable energy,"" said B.C. Hydro spokesperson Mary Anne Coules.

With the snowpack in the West Kootenay region sitting at about a third of its historical level, there are not many concerns yet heading into the spring and summer season, according to Coules, who said Arrow Lakes represented less than one per cent of the utility's power generation output.

""Right now, it is too early in the season to accurately forecast this summer's levels for Kinbasket and Arrow Lakes reservoirs,"" Coules explained. ""In addition, the balance of the annual inflows remains dependent on the amount of rain we will receive across spring and summer.""

The other major waterway contributing to the power equation -- the Kootenay River, which feeds the Kootenay Lake -- is contained under a water licence held by FortisBC, which was unavailable for comment.

Coree Tull, co-chair of the B.C. Watershed Security Coalition, told CBC News last month that limited precipitation in the province's mountains means reservoirs are not being replenished.

That could have devastating knock-on effects on rivers across B.C. -- and everyone who depends on water for their livelihoods, such as agriculture, and for essentials like firefighting efforts.

""We're in a multi-year drought ... it really raises alarm bells,"" she said.

""We start to get really concerned about what the spring, summer and fall will look like this year, given the results that we're seeing.""

A reduced snowpack level poses a threat to the availability of freshwater critical for agriculture, community water systems and ecosystem health.

Tull said in the past year, some farmers have had to cut off irrigation to their crops in some areas, and there has even been shortages of water for battling out-of-control wildfires.

The possibility of a drought does cause a specific set of activities for B.C. Hydro, said Coules.

""We continue to take steps to manage our operations under the current drought and forecasted conditions, including conserving water by drawing on less impacted regions and importing more power -- a common activity during low inflow water years,"" she said.

History shows approximately 80 per cent of the annual B.C. snowpack accumulates by March 1 and peak snowpack occurs mid-April.

The March 1 date is particularly important, considering it is typically the ""penultimate indicator"" of the snow accumulation season, with only a month or two of accumulation remaining.

The B.C. government has already pledged over $80 million to help farmers following last year's drought in the province, and have warned of a dry summer this year.",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,-0.003921568627450966,448977734,12,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7079912.1711207685!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kootenay-steeples-mountains.jpg,

Prepare to pay astronomical prices.,"Denver travelers may want to avert their eyes from the ""math"" of totality

If you haven't already booked your travel to see the solar eclipse on April 8, it could be too late to get decent reservations for flights, hotels, and rental cars -- or it could cost an exorbitant amount.

The total solar eclipse will pass over North America -- including parts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada -- with varying degrees of darkness on April 8. In what is called ""the path of totality,"" the sky will go completely dark for a brief time; other places, like Denver, will see a partial eclipse.

The rush is still on for people to be in that path and experience the strange moment when daytime switches to nighttime with a sudden drop in temperature and darkness.

As the moon covers the sun causing the eclipse, experiences will vary depending on location and weather; it is these variables that make traveling to witness this phenomenon a gamble. In Denver, the sky will be at 65% totality at 12:40 p.m., with the eclipse spanning between 11:28 a.m. to 1:53 p.m. (Parts of Colorado experienced a different kind of eclipse in 2023.)

In an effort to see the full eclipse, people are getting creative as they strategize flight distances, possible clouds, traffic jams and costs.

""United is seeing incredibly strong travel demand to top viewing destinations like Cleveland, Little Rock and San Antonio in the days leading up to and after the eclipse, with bookings up double and triple digits compared to the same time last year,"" said Russell Carlton, corporate communications manager for United Airlines, in an email.

""United also has eleven flights potentially in the solar eclipse path for customers looking to take in the views above the clouds,"" Carlton added. ""Customers on select flights in the path will receive special United eclipse glasses to ensure they get the best -- and safest! -- views.""

In the U.S., the path of totality will cross Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

The closest drive from Denver to see the full eclipse would be Dallas, a 12-hour drive each way. Two-hour flights to Dallas from Denver on Southwest Airlines the weekend before the eclipse were about $500. For comparison, the next three weekends it costs $100 or less to fly from Denver to Dallas. On United Airlines, an economy ticket for the two-hour flight from Denver to Dallas on the Saturday before the eclipse runs $1,374. (For those with six hours to spare, the cost drops to $649 with a stop in Orlando.)

San Antonio, a 14-hour drive from Denver, is even more popular, with fewer flights left across airlines and higher prices for those that have remaining tickets. A search on AAA Travel shows no cars left for rent between April 7 and April 9 in San Antonio; Kayak shows car rentals for those dates available from Sixt for $1,700 to $2,300. La Cantera Resort & Spa is offering a three-night $3,500 Eclipse Package, while hotels in the city's famed Riverwalk area downtown are sold out.

For those who can find a way into San Antonio, there are limited flights out the day after the eclipse: Southwest Airlines is sold out for that entire day and almost completely two days after.

People are betting on clear skies further south, so for those who want to see the eclipse in Mexico, it will be expensive or take considerable time. With American Airlines, travelers can choose a 32-hour flight for $777 with two stops or a six-hour flight for $2,074 (with a variety in between on both price and time).

It's not just the predictably sunny destinations in the path of totality that are experiencing high demand and surge pricing as a result. The shortest flight on United to Rochester, N.Y. will take just under six hours with one stop and cost $1,630 (a week later, the same flight is under $200). While the flight prices and availability shift daily (if not hourly), the pattern remains the same with inflated prices in the day or two prior to the eclipse, with a drastic drop for any other similar day and time.

There are some relative bargains to still be had, though, for spontaneous solar eclipse watchers. A non-stop 2 1/2-hour flight from Denver to Indianapolis on United on April 6 is going for $649. The Holcomb Observatory at Butler University is hosting a free eclipse party, and at Indiana University there is a Hoosier Cosmic Celebration where Star Trek actor William Shatner will deliver a speech (tickets are $19-$59) and actress and singer Janelle Monae will perform. Southwest is slightly less at $586 for a non-stop flight to Indianapolis on April 6.

A nonstop, three-hour flight to Cleveland, Ohio, on United will set you back $548 on April 6. (A week later, that same flight is $90.)

Combining air travel with a road trip in Oklahoma might be the most affordable and closest-to-Denver option. Southwest Airlines has a non-stop, 90-minute flight for $382 on April 6 from Denver to Oklahoma City. The path of totality will cross Broken Bow, about a four-hour drive from Oklahoma City. Rental car rates on AAA Travel are about $80-$90 per day April 6-9 (a week later, prices drop to $29 per day). The trick is finding lodging in this rural spot, but big groups have options at Broken Bow Cabin Lodging, for example, where up to 25 people can split a bill of $3,429 for two nights April 7-9. (Two weeks later, that total cost is $2,096.)

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of every location in the path of totality or each airline or mode of transportation available to get to one of these destinations. Ironically, the entire event -- which includes the moon slowly starting to cross the path of the sun and then briefly covering the sun before it slides over and then fully reveals the sun again -- lasts less than most flights to see it. The entire eclipse event is about 2 1/2 hours long, and the full eclipse can be seen for up to 4 minutes and 27 seconds, depending on location.

A significant storm in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest is expected to bring heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions through Tuesday morning, setting the stage for hazardous travel and power outages.

Back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow as they had all winter, and the latest storm is expected to have longer-lasting impacts than the last.

The ""high-impact"" storm is expected to produce strong, gusty winds and widespread heavy snow over parts of the regions through early next week, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The snow and wind will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow as well as possible blizzard conditions Sunday into Monday.

""Disruptions to daily life"" are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday.

Blizzard warnings have been issued for parts of Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.

""Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,"" the National Weather Service in Goodland, Kansas, warned. ""If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.""

Heavy snow will spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Sunday, continuing into Tuesday. At least 8 inches of snow could cover northern Nebraska and central South Dakota to central Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.

Minneapolis could see up to 12 inches in some areas by Tuesday, rivaling the 11 inches it received over the entirety of the winter season.

Earlier this week, another storm dropped several inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes, beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning. But the storm this weekend will usher in more widespread and troublesome.

More than 300,000 customers were already without power across three states early Sunday, including more than 190,000 in Maine, more than 74,000 in New Hampshire and more than 78,000 in New York, according to poweroutage.us.

""We have more than 6,000 utility workers in the state working to restore power,"" said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a statement Saturday. ""While the worst of the storm is over and snow and ice should taper off as the evening continues, we are closely tracking 80,000 power outages statewide.""

The weather service warned the storm over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will bring strong winds and dump heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines.

Hazardous travel and road closures in the affected areas are expected into early next week. Wind gusts over 50 mph on Sunday could also result in difficult travel, property damage and power outages in the Central and Southern Plains, the weather service warned.

Heavy snow will continue through late Sunday morning over Northern New England. Meanwhile, flood watches on the East Coast are lingering over coastal New Jersey and Delaware.

Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms that could also produce strong wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes are forecast to develop Sunday from central Texas into Kansas. Severe thunderstorms will move into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday, according to the NWS.

Mother Dairy, a leading milk supplier in Delhi-NCR, has nine company-owned dairy processing plants with a total capacity of more than 50 lakh litres per day.

In an interview with PTI, Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd MD Manish Bandlish said, ""Summer is the most anticipated season for our business, especially for categories like ice creams, curd and beverages"".

""With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multifold surge in demand for these categories,"" he added. Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year.

The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to Rs 50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

""As we get into the season, we are all geared up to excite consumers in our golden jubilee year with an array of over 30 new delightful products. The upcoming range will feature around 20 new ice cream products, followed by Greek yoghurts and other dairy products,"" Bandlish said.

Overall, he said the company is very optimistic about the season. ""We expect the demand towards our dairy products to strengthen by 25-30 per cent over the last season's demand,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy has also announced its expansion plan for dairy and fruits and vegetables (F&V) businesses. The company will invest Rs 650 crore to set up two new plants for processing milk and fruits and vegetables. It will also invest another Rs 100 crore to expand the capacities of its existing plants, taking the total capex to Rs 750 crore.

""In our endeavour to expand our distribution and reach to our consumers, we have earmarked a capital expenditure (capex) outlay of over Rs 750 crore to enhance our dairy and F&V processing capacities across key locations,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy is coming up with a big dairy plant in Nagpur with an investment of around Rs 525 crore. The greenfield plant will have a processing capacity of 6 lakh litres of milk per day.

""We also plan to commission a new fruit processing plant in Karnataka with an investment of over Rs 125 crore under our Safal brand,"" Bandlish said. These two plants are likely to be completed in about two years.

For the horticulture (fruits and vegetables) segment, the company has its own four plants, while for edible oils it manufactures through 15 associated plants. Mother Dairy's turnover in 2022-23 stood at around Rs 14,500 crore.

On the expected turnover for this fiscal, Bandlish said, ""Despite a challenging year and subdued summer season last year, deflation in the edible oil sector, the company is likely to exit 2023-24 with a moderate growth rate of around 7-8 per cent in volume terms"". Mother Dairy was commissioned in 1974. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

Mother Dairy was established under the initiative of 'Operation Flood', the world's biggest dairy development programme, launched to make India a milk-sufficient nation.

Mother Dairy, one of the leading dairy players in India, manufactures, markets and sells milk and milk products, including cultured products, ice creams, paneer, ghee, etc under the 'Mother Dairy' brand.

The company also has a diversified portfolio with products in edible oils under the 'Dhara brand and fresh fruits & vegetables, frozen vegetables & snacks, unpolished pulses, pulps & concentrates, etc. Under the 'Safal brand.

It has hundreds of milk booths and Safal retail outlets in Delhi-NCR.

Everyone in the U.S. will see at least a partial solar eclipse, but only those within the 115-mile-wide (185 kilometers) path of totality will witness the sun's face completely blocked by the moon's shadow for up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds.

Only during totality -- when the sun's face is completely blocked -- is it safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun's corona with the naked eye. At all other times, including during the partial phase of the eclipse, you must wear certified solar eclipse glasses to view the sun.

There are some safety issues to be aware of at other times, too. Here are six tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable viewing of the solar eclipse.

Solar eclipse glasses are plentiful and inexpensive. Buy them before stocks run low, and get them only from this list of verified suppliers of safe solar filters and viewers on the American Astronomical Society's AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force website. Only then can you be sure that they comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard, which means they reduce visible sunlight to safe and comfortable levels and block all but a tiny fraction of solar UV and IR radiation.

Do NOT use sunglasses, solar filters meant for cameras and telescopes, smoked glass, welder's goggles, photographic or X-ray film, potato-chip bags or DVDs to view the partially eclipsed sun. None of these methods are safe.

You can use solar eclipse glasses to look at the sun anytime. Typically, however, solar eclipse glasses are used to view the sun from the moment the moon starts to cross it -- a time known as first contact. You must use solar eclipse glasses to look at the eclipse whenever the sun is only partially covered, which is the entire time on April 8 for most of North America.

Although the path of totality on April 8 will include several major cities and metropolitan areas, it crosses a lot of backcountry. Many people will chase clear skies, which could take them to areas they hadn't planned on visiting. Remote parts of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, in particular, are short on facilities and gas stations. So bring everything you need, including a full fuel tank and extra food, water, cash and toilet paper.

In April, you can expect the unexpected, with everything from snow in the Northeast to tornadoes in the Midwest. In remote areas of the northeastern U.S. and Canada, the mountains, lakes and forests may provide a beautiful backdrop, but conditions in the backcountry that time of year can be difficult.

""Since visitors may not be familiar with the area's ever-changing weather and early spring conditions, our most important role is to share important information about being safe and well-prepared and about the planned events throughout the region,"" representatives from the Adirondacks' Regional Office of Sustainable Tourism (ROOST) said in a statement.

ROOST encourages people to avoid mountain trails and waters. Read up on the climate along the eclipse track, look at weather forecasts and decide the best place to watch the eclipse the day before the event.

If you decide to watch the eclipse from a city sidewalk -- perhaps even during a lunch break at work -- then watch out. Wandering into roads and other dangerous situations is easier than you might think when you're looking through solar eclipse glasses. The best, easiest and safest eclipse-observing site is an open space or park, which will likely have a much better view of the eclipse than city streets, where buildings could easily block the view.

The biggest cities inside the path are Mazatlán and Torreón, Mexico; San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Hamilton, Ontario; Montreal Quebec.

Relocating at the last minute in search of clear weather is not particularly recommended unless the roads are clear and you have multiple backup plans. An excellent way to monitor the traffic situation both before and after the eclipse is to use Google Maps or similar apps to monitor live traffic information.

However, you need to know your destination. A great way to begin your research is to use an interactive eclipse map and note the eclipse schedules for various locations in advance. Fred Espenak's Road Atlas for the Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 and Michael Zeiler's Field Guide to the 2023 and 2024 Solar Eclipses ensure you have a spiral-bound hard copy of the path of totality in case you lose your cellphone connection.

Ron Garan, who has logged 71 million miles in space and orbited the planet more than 2,800 times during two missions to the International Space Station, is doing his part to get Earth dwellers excited about the rare astronomical event by giving presentations at the Hudson River Museum in his hometown this weekend.

""It's basically about perspective and trying to zoom out to see the bigger picture of things,"" Garan said about the growing hype surrounding the upcoming event that will be seen in totality from the north and western parts of the state.

""There's this term that was coined back in the 80s called the Overview Effect [by Harvard professor Frank White,]"" the the 62-year-old Boulder, Colorado, resident said.

""He documented a shift in awareness that some astronauts have when they see the planet from in space. There's this big shift when you're aware of the unity and the cosmic dance that we're all part of, and it's a very profound shift, right?

""But when astronomical events like eclipses occur, it's an opportunity for all of us here on the ground to have that same type of shift in perspective.""

Garan, who will observe the total eclipse at a viewing event near Austin, Texas, stressed the importance of donning protective eyewear during the eclipse, which will last for several hours surrounding almost four minutes of darkness in the zone of totality -- a narrow band of about 100 miles that will stretch from Mexico to Maine and beyond.

""When we look up at the sun now, we're looking against a blue sky, right? But when we look at it from space, we're looking at it against a black sky, so we're seeing our sun as a star, as it really is,"" Garan said.

""And you shouldn't look at the Sun. The sunlight is much brighter there. And so, you shouldn't look at the Sun for any extended amount of time on Earth, ah, or space, but, you really need to be careful in space,"" he added, noting that space suits have reflective visors for that purpose.

""In an eclipse, you don't want to look at the Sun at all, because it's very very dangerous [without protective eyewear].""

A total solar eclipse won't be visible from New York again until 2079, when the zone of totality will include the five boroughs.

The astronaut said he hoped the rareness of the event will encourage people to enjoy the ""shift in perspective"" that comes with appreciating routine astronomical wonders.

""The reason why the eclipse in particular is so compelling is because it's so rare,"" said the spaceman.

""But everyday, or actually twice a day, we can experience a sunrise or a sunset, and so that's an equally compelling astronomical event that shows the cosmic dance and our place in the universe, and all that, which should have an equally powerful effect on us.

""We've been conditioned throughout our lives to take these miraculous things for granted, and we're lucky if we notice.""",nypost.com,news,New York Post,,0.1764705882352942,448976761,1,https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/newspress-collage-05k8umu6l-1711280544998.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1711266186&w=1024,eng-9413446

Our energy demand is ever-increasing and with the rising numbers of electric vehicles on our roads, finding sustainable ways of getting power from the plug is more important than ever.

A possible solution lies in Morocco. Here, at the Noor Power Station - just outside Ouarzazate - lies the largest solar complex in the world with enough sun-catching power to keep cities such as Marrakesh and Casablanca running. Noor, which is Arabic for 'light', is made up of a series of areas, but one of the most striking is Noor 3. Here, hundreds of solar panels - each called a heliostat and the size of a squash court - track the sun and reflect its rays up to the top of a 242-metre-tall tower. At this point, the energy is focused into an area filled with molten salt which is, in turn, used to boil water, producing steam which then drives turbines. Hey presto, energy.

And back down to the ground, we've got Skoda's latest Enyaq hooked up to this solar-produced power. Why? Well, to see whether or not electric vehicles are any good at road-tripping, we're taking this Czech firm's core EV on a bit of a road trip.

With a fully topped up battery courtesy of that burning ball in the sky, the Enyaq is detached from its tether and we set off towards our first destination - a desert camp, right on the edge of the Sahara desert.

No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.

But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.

Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.

Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.

Slow and steady wins the race

Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.

Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.

But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.

While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.

Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.

Keep an eye out for more details

Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.

Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.

This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.

However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.

Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.

If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, KS (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In Halifax, police said they were on the scene near Robie Street and North Street, where high winds had knocked a tree down. They're asking people to steer clear of the area while crews respond.

A nearby business confirmed on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that it was without power.

Environment Canada says most of mainland Nova Scotia will receive between 25 to 50 mm of rain on Sunday, moving from west to east and ending early in the afternoon.

All of the province, including Cape Breton Island, can expect to see winds that may reach up to 80 km/h, with the possibility going up to 100 km/h in exposed areas.

No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.

But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.

Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.

Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.

Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.

Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.

But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.

While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.

Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.

Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.

Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.

This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.

However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.

Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.

If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.

As temperatures continue to soar with the onset of summer, residents of the suburbs in Pimpri Chinchwad grappled with unexpected disruptions in power supply over the last week. Interruptions in power supply have not only led to widespread inconvenience but also to concerns that unannounced load shedding may exacerbate as summer approaches its peak, thereby aggravating challenges faced by residents. According to reports, power supply disruptions have been experienced in Nigdi, Pradhikaran, and Chikhali raising fears among residents about the reliability of electricity supply during the summer.

In Pradhikaran, residents of Sectors 24, 27, 27A, and 28 were plunged into darkness unexpectedly two nights ago at 10 p.m., with power not restored until the morning. It may be mentioned that ongoing infrastructure works in Pradhikaran, including the installation of CCTV cameras, cables, and conduits, have occasionally led to disruptions in power supply. Besides, instances of power lines breaking during road excavation due to a lack of coordination between the department and other agencies concerned have been reported.

A recent incident near Mhalsakant Square saw similar disruptions, with main power lines damaged during excavation for a CCTV installation project. Repairing the damage took several hours. Likewise, residents of Datwadi Vitthalwadi, Datta Mandir Road, Pink City Road area and Akurdi areas grappled with power outages for several hours. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has cited ongoing road works, breakdowns and distribution panel malfunctions as the reasons behind frequent interruptions in power supply .

Setback for small-scale industries

The industrial belt of Pimpri Chinchwad is also grappling with similar power supply issues, exacerbating the woes of small-scale entrepreneurs. In the Talwade area, power supply interruptions are frequent, significantly impacting local businesses. Last Tuesday, a power outage in the area worsened challenges for small entrepreneurs. Despite a recent meeting between the entrepreneurs' association and MSEDCL, a resolution to the issue remains elusive. While Thursdays typically serve as a holiday for most companies, interruptions on other days result in financial losses. Meanwhile, Nishikant Raut, public relations officer, MSEDCL, said, ""Power problems are arising in the respective areas due to local reasons. However, they are being resolved quickly. The officers of the respective departments have been informed to resolve the power problem immediately.""",punemirror.com,news,punemirror.com,Pankaj Khole,-0.4666666666666667,448976359,1,https://static.punemirror.com/full/972a60b9-2ce3-4b2a-9c86-52fcd0718894.webp,

What does my removal say about Elon Musk, who flaunts his opposition to censorship, while promising to build an ""everything app"" where you could lose access to banking and messaging for violating dubious speech codes?

On February 17, I was suspended from Twitter/X without warning. The cause was mass-reporting by Zionist activists I'd offended. My removal was justified on the basis that I violated X's ""rules against violent speech."" Having endlessly condemned violence on the platform - in particular, the Gaza genocide - I'm flummoxed. Not least because a post from one of my Zionist detractors, which openly calls for me to be ""battered on a weekly basis"" over my political views, remains extant today.

Despite repeated requests for clarity from X, I have no idea whether I will ever be reinstated. In February, I received from ""support"" stating the suspension will only be reversed after three months. But just a few sentences later, the email contradicted itself, stating in closing that the ban would last just a month. Meanwhile, whenever I log into X, my profile appears to have zero followers or follows, I cannot view or search anyone's tweets (including my own), and my DMs are inaccessible. Have they been erased? A landing page message reads:

""Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can't post, repost, or like content. You won't be able to create new accounts.""

In January 2024, X purged a number of prominent, predominantly left-wing users without warning or explanation. Their suspensions were lifted only after a deluge of complaints poured in to the personal account of Elon Musk, the libertarian tech maven and self-proclaimed free speech warrior who purchased Twitter with his personal fortune.

I am grateful that scores of X users have done the same following my own suspension. However, Musk has kept mum about my case. While I may not have as many followers as those abruptly defenestrated in January, my work has been widely shared on X, with some posts gaining millions of impressions. Most-viewed was my December 2023 revelation that an unadvertised and unnoticed Russian government plane was parked in Washington DC's Dulles airport, a visit which likely represented the beginning of the Ukraine proxy war's end.

This is quite a remarkable turnaround, given the concerted effort to suppress my Twitter output for as long as I have used the platform. One of the most illuminating disclosures in the Twitter Files exposed how the hyper-censorious regime that controlled the social media platform before Musk's takeover required explicit authorization from managers to throttle accounts with more than 100,000 followers. Until then, engineers had free rein to covertly censor, suppress and shadowban anyone they wished, however they wished, without any oversight whatsoever.

This secret protocol offered a compelling explanation for curious developments regarding my own Twitter account in Summer 2022. For 18 months following my 2021 registration for Twitter, my follower count remained stubbornly low. This was until The Grayzone unmasked celebrity ""journalist"" Paul Mason as a British intelligence asset who directly coordinated attacks on anti-war figures and movements with a ""friend"" in the Foreign Office. I was the lead investigator on this series of reports.

The exposés generated significant attention the world over. My followers duly began multiplying by hundreds daily. Curiously, however, whenever I was a few dozen shy of 10,000, the total would crash back down. Evidently, Twitter staffers - and powerful forces breathing down their necks - were absolutely determined no one saw what I had to say.

Besides the exposes of Mason I worked on, there was my October 2019 report revealing Gordon Macmillan, a senior Twitter executive, as a member of 77th Brigade, the British Army's shadowy psychological warfare unit which specializes in the weaponization of social media.

Had Macmillan and his fellow national security cadres exacted revenge on me when I was finally banned from Twitter/X? And what does my permanent removal say about X's new boss, Elon, who advertises X as a platform that ""champions free speech,"" while promising to build an ""everything app"" where you could presumably lose access to your bank and messaging history for violating dubious speech codes?

Gordon MacMillan was one of many high-ranking staffers rightly sacked from the company upon Musk's acquisition. From my perspective, while the owner's politics couldn't be further removed from my own, I have largely defended and embraced the changes he has implemented.

During an October 26, 2023 all-hands meeting at Twitter/X headquarters, Musk opened his remarks by announcing that he was ""transforming the company from what it was, Twitter 1.0, to the everything app.""

He vowed to establish ""a single application that encompasses everything. You can do payments, messages, video, calling, whatever you'd like, from one single, convenient place.""

""We just don't have that,"" Musk lamented. ""It doesn't exist outside of China.""

I might not have been using X for ""everything"", but it was an extremely useful tool in my personal and professional life. My banning offered me a stark illustration of the dangers of relying so heavily on a privately-owned social media app, especially one that provides features that are almost essential in a digital world.

Many are anxious about the rise of digital payments and currencies, for this would inevitably grant financial institutions, and governments, monopoly power over how citizens can spend their cash, and even more gravely, whether they can. Fall foul of such powerful forces, even accidentally, and you might find yourself frozen out of your life savings, perhaps forever. If X is to truly become an ""everything"" app, the implications of a ban will be greatly multiplied, with suspensions effectively locking a user out of every sphere of their public and private life.

We haven't reached that point yet. But the consequences of X's arbitrary suspension process are very real. There are now scores of people -- comrades, collaborators, critics, and journalistic sources -- from whom I'm now cut off, perhaps forever. Meanwhile, the contents of our conversations seem to have been rendered permanently inaccessible - except, perhaps, by Musk himself.

The vaguely-explained, arbitrary suspension means I'm not only being deprived the ability to express my opinions in a public forum, hold the powerful to account, expose hypocrisy, criminality and even genocide, and directly engage with my supporters and detractors. It also means I've lost a platform through which to conduct sensitive conversations with sources across the globe.

In a June 2019 op-ed, United Nations special rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer wrote that once WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had been ""dehumanized through isolation, ridicule and shame, just like the witches we used to burn at the stake, it was easy to deprive him of his most fundamental rights without provoking public outrage worldwide."" A key component of the WikiLeaks founder's ""isolation"" was the Ecuadorian Embassy cutting off his internet access in March 2018.

As I previously revealed, that act was just one aspect of a wide-ranging black propaganda campaign executed by a British intelligence cutout called the Integrity Initiative. By falsely framing Assange as a Russian agent, London successfully pressured Quito into banning his personal visits as well as any and all communication with the outside world. Immediately thereafter, British police launched 'Operation Pelican,' a scheme designed to extract Assange from the embassy and ultimately transfer him into US custody.

Operation Pelican succeeded one year later, and Assange has festered in Belmarsh Prison, Britain's Gitmo, ever since. As he awaits extradition to Washington, where he could face 175 years in a supermax prison, Assange has been blocked from communicating with the outside world. Press photographers were even prohibited from capturing his wedding day inside the jail on the grounds of national security. Is my Twitter/X suspension part of a similar effort to isolate me, so when the British state deprives me of my most fundamental rights, it won't provoke public outrage?

Alternatively, recall the role Twitter/X played in the case of independent journalist Steve Sweeney, who was arbitrarily detained in Mexico while on his way to cover Nicaragua's November 2021 election, which the US State Department had condemned. Sweeney might have languished in prison for an interminable period had word not immediately spread across Twitter, resulting in his release after three nightmarish days in custody without food or clean water. Activists in Mexico were at the forefront of the push to free Sweeney.

Since May 2023, when British counter-terror officials detained, interrogated, and digitally strip searched me for six hours without granting my right to silence or privacy, I have found travel unnerving -- particularly the act of arriving at, walking through, and exiting airports.

I don't know what information global databases display about me, which claims regarding my character have been shared with foreign governments, or whether I've been erroneously flagged as an international security threat.

Influential security state-tied figures like Paul Mason have openly clamored for me to be jailed as punishment for my journalistic activities. Heidi Bachram, the British pro-Israel activist who led the campaign to mass-report me on X over my solidarity with Palestine, has expressed hope that I ""will never again be allowed to visit"" my homeland. Her supporters have echoed the sentiment.

There are clear indications that a number of shadowy, intelligence-linked elements are monitoring my activity online. In November 2023, an Irish defense consultant who claims to have ""advised government, military and civil society actors in Ukraine and other European countries regarding defence policy,"" bizarrely alleged: ""Klarenberg...showed his FSB signature training as [sic] early 2014.""

I have no idea what they were alluding to, and certainly have never received any training by Russian intelligence. But it's not unreasonable to think I'd be in the military alliance's crosshairs. That same month, the NATO Stratcom Center of Excellence described me as one of the ""agents and sympathizers"" of a ""hostile regime"" in a report which effusively advocated for the cyberbullying, harassment, stalking, and doxxing of anti-imperialists.

Apparently not content with simply targeting me personally, these same forces have relentlessly attacked The Grayzone as well. In August 2022, longtime British intelligence operative Ross Burley publicly smeared The Grayzone as a ""Russian propaganda outfit"" and asserted it was ""incredibly irresponsible for YouTube and other social media companies"" to platform our journalists. The cause of his ire may have been our 2021 report on leaked files that exposed details of Britain's wide-ranging, clandestine intelligence operations targeting Russia.

In response, Twitter took the unprecedented step of applying a ""warning"" label to each and every tweet linked to this report, cautioning users it contained ""materials obtained through hacking."" The policy backfired, however, after countless users mocked the label and turned it into a meme. Others, meanwhile, suggested Twitter's label simply amounted to a seal of authenticity that confirmed the leaked material's veracity. As to the question of why the social network chose to slap this label on The Grayzone exclusively, and overlook Western-funded ""OSINT"" collectives such as Bellingcat which routinely publish stolen material, recent developments may provide some clue.

In February, Politico revealed that Britain's Defence and Security Media Advisory (DSMA) Committee had been unsuccessfully attempting to woo major social media platforms to join its board. The Committee is a Ministry of Defence-run censorship mechanism tasked with dictating which security-related stories mainstream media is authorized to report. When the Committee asks British journalists and editors to withhold information from the public, they almost always comply.

Politico quoted Geoffrey Dodds, a DSMA secretary and former military official, as saying Google and Meta were among the social media giants on the Committee's wishlist. He proposed that tech firms monitor their platforms for content relating to Britain's ""national security,"" then seek the Committee's advice on whether to censor. Yet his effort has so far been unsuccessful, as the companies reportedly ""felt that they couldn't sit on [the board] because it was too linked to government.""

Still, Dodds remained optimistic that the British government would ""come up with a grand bargain with the tech giants...then hopefully, we'll be able to get the tech giants back on board."" Politico said the Committee was ""steadfast"" in its determination to get social media firms aboard. Dodds remarked that moving forward, ""there's probably going to be less print, just as much broadcasting, and a continued increase in social media and online [news]...So we need to get into this game.""

Publicly-available minutes of the DSMA Committee's June 2023 meeting show that the body's Deputy Secretary, retired Navy Captain Jon Perkins, disclosed that between October 2022 and April 2023, material of ""extreme sensitivity (in national security terms)"" had been ""protected from inadvertent disclosure"" thanks to the Committee's interventions with journalists. This material was ""of the most sensitive nature he had seen"" since joining.

While the ""nature"" of that ""material"" was unstated, Perkins may well have been referring to a series of investigations The Grayzone published throughout that precise period detailing London's secret and pivotal role in escalating the Ukraine proxy war. Given this outlet's reputation as a leading source of insight on the cloak-and-dagger machinations of the US and British-led Western national security state, the DSMA Committee would welcome its suppression on Twitter/X and other platforms at least as much as it did my indefinite suspension.

After years of pressure from Western security state operatives, I was finally banished from Twitter/X under the watch of the billionaire owner who has flaunted his ideological opposition to censorship.

""The VRA wishes to state that since 1972, the Authority has been supplying power to neighbouring countries without reneging on its mandate to deliver reliable and affordable power to Ghana; and this the Authority continues to do,"" the statement read.

""Also, it is important to mention that the allocation of the power generated from the Akosombo and Kpong hydropower stations is supervised by the Electricity Market Oversight Panel (EMOP) and not the VRA. By this arrangement, the allocation always prioritizes the Ghana market, in accordance with government policies to ensure long-term optimization of the nation's hydro resources,"" it added.

The VRA however assured the general public and all other stakeholders that it will continue to prioritize electricity supply to the Ghana market in line with its mandate, government policies and regulatory obligations.

Argentines' efforts to preserve their savings amid the ongoing decline of their national currency, the Argentine peso, has resulted in the nation recently hitting its highest demand for Bitcoin BTC tickers down $64,566 in 20 months, according to a recent report.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

On March 20, Bloomberg reported data sourced from cryptocurrency exchange Lemon Cash revealing that nearly 35,000 customers in Argentina purchased Bitcoin in the week ending March 10, double the weekly average compared to 2023.

A major factor for the increase in demand is the ongoing decline of the nation's currency.

Over the past twelve months, the peso's value against the United States dollar has plummeted, dropping from $0.0049/peso in March 2023 to $0.0012/peso at the time of publication.

However, it was noted that Lemon wasn't the only platform seeing a surge in demand. Other major exchanges in Argentina, such as Ripio and Belo, reported similar trends.

According to the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, Manuel Beaudroi, stablecoin purchases in Argentina declined from 70% to 60% as Bitcoin's recent price surge attracted more interest.

""The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.""

He also claimed that Belo has seen volume in Bitcoin and Ether increase ""tenfold so far in 2024 compared to the same period last year.""

However, a recent report suggests that interest in stablecoins might still exist, as Argentines may choose not to use the well-known exchanges within the country to purchase them.

On Feb. 12, Cointelegraph reported that Argentines are using black market exchanges, known locally as ""crypto caves,"" to buy U.S. dollar stablecoins in an effort to escape strict currency controls and the rising inflation of the peso.",sgtreport.com,news,SGT Report,,0.1764705882352942,448976228,1,,

The power utility firm says it has heightened crackdown on theft of electrical equipment and surveillance of its network across the coastal region.

Eng. Phineas Marete the firm's Manager for Coast region says Kenya power is out to curb vandalism that impacts on the power distribution network.

Eng. Marete says they are working closely with the security agencies and National Government Administrative Officers (NGAO) in the crackdown of vandalism that targets the electricity infrastructure.

""The unfortunate acts of vandalism that targets the electricity assets such as transformers and electricity towers usually plunges Kenyans into darkness,"" he said.

Marete expressed the views at a forum in Pride Inn Hotel organized by the power utility firm for journalists based in Kwale County.

He says while customers grapple with electricity shortages the situation is often compounded by incessant vandalism of power assets.

""Increase of cases of vandalism and energy theft through illegal connections has prompted us to work with the security agencies to assist us in the protection of our power installations to enable work to go on effectively,"" he said.

He says increased incidents of vandalism of electrical assets in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties leads to power supply disruptions and huge financial and reputational losses to the power company.

The KPLC regional official termed the state of theft and vandalism of transformers and power line cables in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties as deplorable.

He says rampant vandalism in the three coastal counties has forced KPLC to rope in the security agencies in the hunt for the vandals.

He says the police and KPLC have come together to fight off vandalism of power systems, equipment and materials blamed on scrap metal businesses.

""Cases of vandalism forces us to expend a lot of resources in repairing and replacing damaged power equipment,"" he said and called on concerted efforts from stakeholders to contain the menace.

He reiterated the resolve of KPLC towards fighting vandalism and called on well-meaning and law-abiding Kenyans to work together with the power company in fighting the menace.

Marete says darkness caused by vandalism and energy theft threatens the economy as industries are shut because companies cannot meet production targets and may operate below installed capacity.

He says vandalism runs counter to the country's quest for improved and steady power supply for domestic and industrial purposes.

""We want all and sundry to join us in the fight against vandalism of vital power assets from the grip of criminals,"" he said.

Eng. Marete says KPLC will not waver from its mandate of providing quality, safe and reliable electricity services despite the numerous setbacks it faces such as the twin problems of theft and vandalism.

Eng. Marete at the same time urged road agencies such as Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) to liaise with the power company during road constructions.

He says the road agencies should seek their input whenever building new roads and upgrading existing ones to safeguard electricity poles along the roads.

""We have realized whenever new roads are being put up or old ones expanded they lead to the collapse of electricity poles and result in disruption of power supplies,"" he said.",kenyanews.go.ke,news,kenyanews.go.ke,,0.05098039215686279,448976143,1,,

A significant storm in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest is expected to bring heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions through Tuesday morning, setting the stage for hazardous travel and power outages.

Back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow as they had all winter, and the latest storm is expected to have longer-lasting impacts than the last.

The ""high-impact"" storm is expected to produce strong, gusty winds and widespread heavy snow over parts of the regions through early next week, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The snow and wind will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow as well as possible blizzard conditions Sunday into Monday.

""Disruptions to daily life"" are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday.

Blizzard warnings have been issued for parts of Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.

""Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,"" the National Weather Service in Goodland, Kansas, warned. ""If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.""

Heavy snow will spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Sunday, continuing into Tuesday. At least 8 inches of snow could cover northern Nebraska and central South Dakota to central Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.

Minneapolis could see up to 12 inches in some areas by Tuesday, rivaling the 11 inches it received over the entirety of the winter season.

Earlier this week, another storm dropped several inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes, beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning. But the storm this weekend will usher in more widespread and troublesome.

More than 300,000 customers were already without power across three states early Sunday, including more than 190,000 in Maine, more than 74,000 in New Hampshire and more than 78,000 in New York, according to poweroutage.us.

""We have more than 6,000 utility workers in the state working to restore power,"" said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a statement Saturday. ""While the worst of the storm is over and snow and ice should taper off as the evening continues, we are closely tracking 80,000 power outages statewide.""

The weather service warned the storm over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will bring strong winds and dump heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines.

Hazardous travel and road closures in the affected areas are expected into early next week. Wind gusts over 50 mph on Sunday could also result in difficult travel, property damage and power outages in the Central and Southern Plains, the weather service warned.

Heavy snow will continue through late Sunday morning over Northern New England. Meanwhile, flood watches on the East Coast are lingering over coastal New Jersey and Delaware.

Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms that could also produce strong wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes are forecast to develop Sunday from central Texas into Kansas. Severe thunderstorms will move into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday, according to the NWS.

The BJP in 2019 fielded Bollywood actor Sunny Deol, who owes his roots to Punjab, from Gurdaspur, the seat represented four times by yesteryear actor Vinod Khanna, who died in April 2017 due to cancer.

Deol won his electoral debut by defeating Congress heavyweight and sitting MP Sunil Jakhar from the Gurdaspur constituency with a margin of over 80,000 votes in 2019.

Jakhar, currently the state BJP unit chief, had won the Lok Sabha bypoll by 193,219 votes in October 2017. The bypoll was necessitated by the demise of BJP sitting MP Vinod Khanna.

Deol's iconic ""tareekh pe tareekh"" may have captivated cinegoers but he did not address the House once during the five year term, as per reports.

Last month, Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann took a jibe at Deol, saying ""politics means serving and being available to people round the clock"".

Son of veteran actor Dharmendra, Deol, does not have any direct connection with Gurdaspur city though his father hails from Sahnewal town near Punjab's industrial town Ludhiana. He is a Jat Sikh.

His father Dharmendra was elected from Bikaner as an MP in 2004, while his step mother Hema Malini is seeking third term from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh as a BJP candidate.

Deol entered the Hindi film industry with 'Betaab' in 1983 and his best hits include 'Border', 'Damini' and 'Gadar'.

Deol's unforgettable dialogue from 1990's Hindi film 'Ghayal', 'Jab yeh dhai kilo ka haath kisi pe padta hai na, toh aadmi uthta nahi... utth jata hai' (When this hand weighing 2.5 kg is kept on some person, they don't get up, they go up (they will die) was quite hit during his campaigning in the 2019 polls.

Gurdaspur lies in the north of Punjab, sharing an international border with Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir. The area is not as developed as other areas in Punjab.

The Gurdaspur constituency, which has 15,95,284 voters, including 7,45,479 women, has nine assembly constituencies. It has a high number of serving and retired defence personnel.

BJP's Vinod Khanna represented the Gurdaspur constituency four times -- 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2014, while Congress candidate Sukhbuns Kaur Binder five times in a row -- 1980, 1984, 1989, 1991 and 1996.

Congress' Pratap Singh Bajwa was MP from Gurdaspur from 2009 to 2014. He is now sitting legislator and the Leader of Opposition.

The Gurdaspur constituency has seen two major militant attacks by Pakistan-backed militant outfits in the recent past.

In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab. It contested three Lok Sabha seats (Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur), while the Akali Dal contested the remaining 10 seats.

At that time, Congress had won eight seats -- Amritsar, Faridkot, Anandpur Sahib, Jalandhar, Khadoor Sahib, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Patiala seats -- while the Akali Dal won Bathinda and Ferozepur and the BJP Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur seats.

The Aam Aadmi Party won from Sangrur.

This time, there seems to be a four-cornered contest on this seat as AAP is contesting the elections alone in Punjab without an alliance with the opposition's INDIA bloc.

All four major parties are yet to declare their candidates.

The BJP is mulling to field either Kavita Khanna, wife of four-time ex-MP Vinod Khanna, or two-time Pathankot legislator Ashwani Sharma, or ex-MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, who is estranged brother of Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa.

The party's request was turned down in view of the ""law and order situation"". DC Memon stated that the party had already violated NOCs (no objection certificates) issued on earlier occasions.

Two days prior, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq instructed the capital's Deputy Commissioner to address the issue and submit a report accordingly, as per The Express Tribune.

The request for permission for a public gathering on either March 23 or 30, at Parade Ground, F9 Park, or D Chowk at 10 pm, was made by the regional president of the former ruling party, Amir Masood Mughal.

According to The Express Tribune, the secretary of interior, chief commissioner, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner, and SSP operations were addressed in the application.

It demanded the law enforcement agencies refrain from blocking the routes to the venue and abstain from arresting or baton-charging party supporters.

The PTI submitted formal written requests to the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner on March 15 and 18 to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but received no response until March 21.

Later, Imran's party approached the court after alleging that the district administration was unresponsive to their request, therefore, the court should issue directions in this regard.

The PTI also faced similar rejections earlier, as the Rawalpindi District Administration declined the party's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh on February 5, right before the crucial general elections.

District Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema rejected the PTI's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh, saying that it was not possible to allow the party to hold a rally in the city as it might affect the law and order situation.",dtnext.in,news,dtNext.in,,0.1137254901960785,448975991,1,https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/03/24/811480-pti.jpg,

Do you spend your free moments obsessing over every little detail from Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi epic? Then The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, a behind-the-scenes look at the film from Insight Editions, will be right up your alley.

Written by Dune producer Tanya Lapointe and Stefanie Broos, The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two dives headfirst into the making of the film. Gorgeous spreads of concept art and photography abound, as well as interviewers with the craftspeople who brought the planets of Arrakis, Giedi Prime, and more to life. Not only will you get to bask in the visual splendor of Dune: Part Two, but you'll learn a lot more about the movie as well. I've laid out five of my favorite tidbits from The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two below, but there are so, so many more where these came from.

""The Art and Soul of 'Dune: Part Two'"" Buy On Amazon↗ 1. Dune: Part Two features a real-life eclipse.

Dune: Part Two's opening fight scene between the Fremen and Harkonnen soldiers takes place during a solar eclipse, making for some instantly memorable orange-tinted visuals courtesy of cinematographer Greig Fraser. In an exciting twist of fate, the cast and crew of Dune: Part Two witnessed an actual partial solar eclipse on October 25, 2022. The camera crew was able to capture footage of the eclipse, which wound up in the final cut of the film. To stay true to the lore that Arrakis has two moons, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and his team added a second moon to the eclipse footage.

2. Inspiration for Harkonnen architecture came from unique places -- including septic tanks.

In my review of Dune: Part Two, I praised the Harkonnens' insectoid architecture as one of the visual highlights of the film. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two confirms the insect inspirations when it comes to all things Harkonnen, but it also singles out one of production designer Patrice Vermette's most surprising points of reference: septic tanks. ""Black, shiny, and new,"" Vermette tells Villeneuve.

The septic tank is just one of many fascinating references for the design teams discussed in the book. Others include the Sardaukar's Excalibur-inspired swords and the Harkonnens' inkblot-esque ""negative fireworks.""

3. The baby sandworm was a practical effect.

The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two contains no shortage of sandworm goodness, including a pages-long discussion of how the film brought Paul's first worm ride to life. Also of note is the section on the baby worm that lives in the Southern Fremen's Maker's Temple. While a CG worm was a possibility, Dune: Part Two ended up using practical effects, including a worm puppet.

According to The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, the shot of the baby worm moving through the sand was the biggest challenge for the film's special effects team. They built the worm out of eight balls connected by a chain, then ran it under the sand on two sets of tracks -- one for its circular movements, one for its straight path towards the Maker Keeper (Alison Halstead).

4. Feyd-Rautha's gladiator fight was partly inspired by bullfighting.

My favorite side characters in Dune: Part Two are the black-clothed Harkonnen servants with distinct curved headdresses who assist Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in the fighting arena on Giedi Prime. They have their roots in Frank Herbert's Dune as Feyd's barb-men, but Lapointe and Broos write that Villeneuve specifically wanted picador silhouettes for these characters, ""just like in bullfighting.""

The bullfighting imagery enhances the showmanship and cruelty of the Harkonnens' war games, with the remaining House Atreides fighter Lanville (Roger Yuan) taking on the role of a doomed bull. It also ties back to House Atreides' deeper connection to bullfighting. As discussed in the first Dune, Paul's (Timothée Chalamet) grandfather fought bulls for sport, even dying in a bullfight. Later, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) walks into a treacherous ""arena"" of his own on Arrakis, and Paul will take on a dangerous, unpredictable enemy in his duel with Feyd. It seems the Atreides can never fully escape bullfighting, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense.

5. Which deleted scenes didn't make it into Dune: Part Two?

Villeneuve has said he won't release any deleted scenes from Dune: Part Two, which include sequences featuring Stephen McKinley Henderson's Thufir Hawat as well as Tim Blake Nelson in an undisclosed role (which some speculate was Count Fenring). The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also hints at other moments that were cut from the final film.

One such moment came after the funereal ceremony for Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), during which the Fremen take the water from his body. In an early version of the scene, Lapointe and Broos write, Paul receives water rings representing Jamis' water -- a key part of Fremen culture in the novel. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also showcases artwork of the water rings, along with other props used in the ceremony.

In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab. It contested three Lok Sabha seats (Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur), while the Akali Dal contested the remaining 10 seats.

At that time, Congress had won eight seats -- Amritsar, Faridkot, Anandpur Sahib, Jalandhar, Khadoor Sahib, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Patiala seats -- while the Akali Dal won Bathinda and Ferozepur and the BJP Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur seats.

The Aam Aadmi Party won from Sangrur.

This time, there seems to be a four-cornered contest on this seat as AAP is contesting the elections alone in Punjab without an alliance with the opposition's INDIA bloc.

All four major parties are yet to declare their candidates.

The BJP is mulling to field either Kavita Khanna, wife of four-time ex-MP Vinod Khanna, or two-time Pathankot legislator Ashwani Sharma, or ex-MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, who is estranged brother of Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa.",ommcomnews.com,news,Ommcom News,,0.02745098039215677,448975744,1,https://ommcomnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/202312173095852-1-e1711279620292.jpeg,

The Himachal Pradesh Congress on Sunday accused the BJP of conspiring to topple its government in the state out of greed for power by instigating its members.

The party's remarks came in the wake of nine MLAs -- six Congress rebels and three independents, who had voted in favour of the BJP nominee Harsh Mahajan in the Rajya Sabha elections on 27 February -- joining the BJP in Delhi on Friday.

The leaders said the six Congress MLAs, who were already stripped of their Assembly membership, hatched a conspiracy with the BJP to topple the democratically elected government.

Ed Cackett is a professional astronomer, poking into grand and mysterious things billions of miles away. By his standards, this rare total solar eclipse the rest of us are besotted with is happening around the corner.

Dr. Cackett, distinguished chair of the physics and astronomy department at Wayne State University, watched the last total eclipse in 2017. Been there, at the top of a mountain in Idaho, and done that.

Come April 8, then, at 2:27 p.m. EDT or so, while we slack-jawed yokels are gazing upward through our protective glasses ...

""I'll be saying 'wow,' too,"" he says.

Cackett, 43, has been a little kid about the stars since he was a little kid. Heavens, yes, he'll tell you, this solar eclipse is a worthy and wonderful thing to watch, even if metro Detroit won't quite get the full effect.

As an astronomer, he says, ""it's super exciting to see such a rare event.""

As a realist, he also says, ""April is a pretty sucky month for it to happen.""

But don't be put off by those technical terms. Have faith that the 65% chance of clouds in Michigan means a 35% chance of clear skies. Revel in the sights and sounds.

An eclipse, as Cackett knows, is a time to ponder our place in the vast universe. To be dazzled by nature's wonders. To reaffirm our innate quest for knowledge.

The Michigan Science Center will throw an eclipse viewing party at the Ford House in Grosse Pointe, because of course. Sonic will start selling a Blackout Slush Float on Monday, complete with eclipse viewing glasses, because why not.

The eclipse will be the grandest occasion for commercial tie-ins since Presidents Day. Maybe even since the Super Bowl, and the eclipse doesn't have a mob of lawyers telling everyone you can't use its name.

Also like the Super Bowl, the eclipse will be one more thing the Detroit Lions get to watch along with the rest of us. (What, too soon?) And if you take simple precautions -- who'd be obtuse enough to stare directly at the sun? -- it should be spectacular.

""Cool things happen the whole time,"" Cackett says. ""It gets dark during the daytime, and you see nature react. You hear the difference in the birds. It starts to get cooler.""

At totality, when the moon directly obscures the sun, ""you see stars in the daytime sky. You see the corona light up. The shadows start to go fuzzy and have weird shapes. It's just fun, whether you're a scientist or a regular person.""

He'll watch from Horseshoe Bay, Texas, northwest of Austin, at a conference of the high energy astrophysics division of the American Astronomical Society.

The high energy astrophysicists are no dummies. They tweaked their schedule to coincide with the eclipse, and picked a location that's one of the least likely spots on the path of totality to be overcast.

It was either that, or wait until 2044 for the next full eclipse in the continental U.S. Or 2099, if they want to see one from Detroit.

The launch of a career

Cackett grew up outside Manchester, in the northwest of England, and learned to appreciate the cosmos on Boy Scouts camping trips.

The adults would talk about the stars, how some are red and some are blue, and he'd wonder, ""Why is that?""

As humans, he notes, we are naturally intrigued, trying to make sense of what we know and identify what we don't.

Why do we exist? Why do stars seem to twinkle? Why do we drive on a parkway, but park in a driveway?

Curiosity crosses boundaries. Answers lead to more questions. Sometimes there are practical applications; helium was first detected during a solar eclipse in 1868, and now we have party balloons. Sometimes knowledge is its own reward.

Cackett's work focuses on trying to understand how material falls into supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.

For that, he sometimes employs WSU's computer-operated Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory in remote Rodeo, New Mexico, donated by an astronomer turned businessman in honor of a high school friend who had shared his passion for the night sky.

The powerful telescope there won't be of use during the eclipse. It's outside the path of totality, Cackett explains, and not being equipped with a special filter, ""if we point it at the sun, we'll fry everything.""

But it has helped him see how the brightness of light changes over time, which, in turn, might tell what occurs as things tumble into the oblivion of a black hole, which might ultimately help starships navigate distant galaxies.

The black holes are millions of light years from Earth. They are, Cackett says, 1 million to 1 billion times the size of the sun.

Councillor Sam Smith, cabinet nember for education and SEND, explained that the demand for school places in Rushcliffe can be greater than across other boroughs due to an increase in houses being built, as well as families moving to the borough from across the county ""to get to good schools"".

Although there are sufficient places for primary-age pupils in Rushcliffe, the demand proves more significant at secondary level. Cllr Smith explained: ""This is due to the historic high birth rates that we've had which created a population bulge, resulting in higher demand.

""Now, that higher demand has gone through the primary sector and the bulge years are in the secondary one. We are also seeing at primary level a decline in birth rate, which is the opposite to what we had a few years ago.""

He added: ""Rushcliffe's a very popular area and there is an increase in housing being built across the borough, but also families move into Rushcliffe to get to good schools, so inward migration from across the county is also a factor that adds to the demand for school places. However, we are, as a council, meeting that demand.""

This comes as figures from the county council revealed that Rushcliffe was the borough where the lowest percentage of pupils was offered one of their preferences for the September 2024 admissions. This stands at 97.2 per cent, compared to a county average of 98 per cent.

More pupils were offered their first preference - 90.5 per cent - in Rushcliffe, compared to Mansfield, 89.6 per cent, and Ashfield, 89 per cent. Cllr Smith said: ""We've seen an increase from last year in families who received one of their preferences for secondary school places.

""That proves the work that the county council is doing to increase capacity at secondary schools in Rushcliffe is working. I predict the figures will increase as we go forward as a result of the work we're doing.""

To meet the demand, Cllr Smith explained that the council monitors projections on a five-year basis, which look at factors such as birth rates and house building. The council also works with academy trusts and local authorities to increase the number of school places available ""where possible"".

This was done at primary level by building the new Millside Spencer Academy in East Leake, which will serve the Rempstone Road development and boast 315 places once completed. A new school is also being built on the 3,000-home Fairham development near Clifton, which will benefit from 630 places.

The Rosecliffe Spencer Academy in Edwalton has also received an expansion recently, which resulted in 105 new places. The councillor added that the authority is ""spending serious money on expanding secondary spaces in Rushcliffe"".

About £2.6 million was spent on the extension of the South Nottinghamshire Academy in Radcliffe on Trent, creating 150 more places. Rushcliffe Spencer Academy in West Bridgford has also received £27 million which will deliver an additional 450 secondary places and 110 sixth form places.

Cllr Smith said: ""There is an increase in housing and this results in a bigger demand for school places, the council recognises that. We invest taxpayers' money into meeting that demand.""

The council also submitted plans to extend the planning permission for mobile classrooms at Lady Bay Primary School on Trent Boulevard for five years in October 2023 as relocation plans appear to have been delayed. Cllr Smith says the classrooms are ""still required"" to accommodate the number of pupils at the school.

He said: ""Not renewing permission for the mobile classrooms would lead to a deficit of places in Lady Bay. We wouldn't want to do that.

""We want children to be able to attend Lady Bay in large numbers and the temporary mobile classrooms allow us to do that and that's why we've extended that. This means parents in Lady Bay still have the option to send their children to that good school.""

In 2021, plans were revealed for a secondary school on the land off Regatta Way in West Bridgford, which would accommodate 750 secondary school places and a 200-place sixth form on the site, with the potential to expand to 950 places with a 250-place sixth form. Cllr Smith said: ""Nottinghamshire County Council is examining the possibility of building a new secondary school on land at Regatta Way.

Following a nighttime breach of Polish airspace by a Russian cruise missile launched against cities in western Ukraine, Poland warned on Sunday that it will demand an explanation from Moscow.

As Moscow intensifies its assaults on its western neighbour, Poland said the missile was a component of a Russian bombardment of targets in Ukraine.

""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems,"" foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement.

Following a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine by Russia, Poland activated ""all air defence systems, all air force systems"", the country's Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

According to him, ""had there been any indication it was heading for a target on Polish territory,"" the missile would have been shot down.

Around 400 metres (1,300 feet) above the earth, the missile was moving at over 800 kilometres per hour (500 mph), according to the army. It had crossed the border into Poland by around two miles.

""Polish airspace was breached by one of the cruise missiles fired in the night by the air forces&mldr; of the Russian Federation,"" the army wrote on X.

""The object flew through Polish airspace above the village of Oserdow (Lublin province) and stayed for 39 seconds,"" the statement said, adding that it was tracked by military radar throughout its flight.

""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on permanent alert to ensure the security of Polish airspace,"" the army said.

A similar incident occurred on December 29, 2023, when a Russian missile penetrated Polish airspace for several minutes before returning to Ukraine.

In November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, close to the Ukrainian border.

The latest information has been put on the table by certain supply chain resources and research firms' analysts.

To begin with, the CSI Taurus organization says that Huawei has started the bulk supply of P70 series models, gearing towards the launch of the respective lineup. It hints that the company is all set to achieve its new smartphone shipment target.

On the other hand, the China Merchants Securities firm shared a report, saying that the P70 models have already entered the stock preparation stage. Thus, the next P-series may arrive in April, leading to a big hit for Huawei in the first half of this year.

Another research factory - Minsheng Securities said that the Huawei P70 series could begin a circle of new opportunities in the smartphone industry chain, this April.

Debon Securities points out that the Chinese tech maker will improve its product's strength this year, focusing on the order and the supply chain concept. It will further enhance the camera, performance, and other key aspects of the upcoming phones.

In the meantime, a Weibo tipster says that the company has been supplying the P70 series for a long while and now it is ready to step in the real world.

Some persons related to the Huawei supply chain said that consumers are carrying high expectations from the new smartphone lineup, which ultimately makes the market demand quite strong for the P70 series.

However, we cannot forget that the company made a straight response to such expectations and assumptions - 'the release date has not disclosed yet!'. Hence, it would be better to take this piece of input with a grain of salt.

Huawei P70 Series is hearsay to be 'far ahead' and much more powerful than its predecessors. The lineup is likely to fetch new camera solutions that can raise the photography standard to the next level. Besides, a few leaks suggest that the P70 models will bring AI and upgraded satellite-based features.

Though capable of generating impressive visual content, the conventional models grapple with scalability and computational efficiency, especially when deployed for high-resolution image and video generation. This challenge stems from the quadratic complexity inherent in transformer-based structures, a staple in the architecture of most diffusion models.

The State-Space Models (SSMs), where the Mamba model has emerged as a beacon of efficiency for long-sequence modeling. Mamba's prowess in 1D sequence modeling hinted at its potential for revolutionizing the efficiency of diffusion models. However, its adaptation to the complexities of 2D and 3D data, integral for image and video processing, could have been more straightforward. The crux lies in maintaining spatial continuity, an aspect critical for preserving the quality and coherence of generated visual content yet often overlooked in conventional approaches.

The breakthrough came with the introduction of Zigzag Mamba (ZigMa) by researchers of LMU Munich, a diffusion model innovation that incorporates spatial continuity into the Mamba framework. This method, described in the study as a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter paradigm, retains the integrity of spatial relationships within visual data and does so with improvements in speed and memory efficiency. ZigMa's efficacy is underscored by its ability to outperform existing models across several benchmarks, demonstrating enhanced computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity of generated content.

The research meticulously details ZigMa's application across various datasets, including FacesHQ 1024×1024 and MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, showcasing its adeptness at handling high-resolution images and complex video sequences. A particular highlight from the study reveals ZigMa's performance on the FacesHQ dataset, where it achieved a lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 37.8 using 16 GPUs, compared to the Bidirectional Mamba model's score of 51.1.

The versatility of ZigMa is demonstrated through its adaptability to various resolutions and its capacity to maintain high-quality visual outputs. This is particularly evident in its application to the UCF101 dataset for video generation. ZigMa, employing a factorized 3D Zigzag approach, consistently outperformed traditional models, indicating its superior handling of temporal and spatial data complexities.

In conclusion, ZigMa emerges as a novel diffusion model that adeptly balances computational efficiency with the ability to generate high-quality visual content. Its unique approach to maintaining spatial continuity sets it apart, offering a scalable solution for generating high-resolution images and videos. With impressive performance metrics and versatility across various datasets, ZigMa advances the field of diffusion models and opens new avenues for research and application in visual data processing.",marktechpost.com,news,MarkTechPost,Adnan Hassan,0.2784313725490195,448974683,1,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-9.40.15-PM.png,

Making the revelation at the weekend, the body also stated that about 67 percent of Nigerian population does not have access to basic water supply.

National Chairman of NIWE, Engr. (Dr.) Adeyinka Sobowale, disclosed this at a press conference in Abeokuta, Ogun State, as part of activities marking this year's World Water Day, with the theme, 'Water for Peace "".

This is a saying among eclipse chasers, and it's very rarely incorrect. In the run-up to a total solar eclipse, entire nations read about the coming rare celestial event and collectively utter, ""I think I've seen one of those.""

None of them are correct. All of them are misremembering. What they witnessed was a partial solar eclipse, the kind which occurs twice every year across vast swathes of the planet.

How can we be sure? Nobody only thinks they saw a total solar eclipse. If you're one of the one in 10,000 people who ever experience totality -- when the sun is blocked entirely by the moon -- it's not something you ever forget. It's not something you vaguely remember years later. It's something you cherish for the rest of your life.

Besides, seeing a total solar eclipse usually requires making a big effort. To witness one, you must be on the path of totality, the area on Earth where the moon completely blocks the sun. If you're not within the path of totality, you'll only see a partial solar eclipse.

So if you only think you saw one, every eclipse chaser immediately suspects that you didn't actually see one at all.

Lots of people in North America have seen a total solar eclipse. The continent is living through a golden age of eclipses at the moment, with the most recent being the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017, which brought totality to 12 U.S. states from Oregon to South Carolina. About 12 million people lived on that path, and about a million traveled to be in it. Were you on that path? If you were, you'd know it. You'll remember the beautiful twilight-like sky, the silhouette of the moon and the achingly beautiful sight of the sun's spiky white corona shining all around it. Witnessing that will be one of your most cherished memories.

""I think I saw one of those in school/work"" is a common belief. Ask a few questions, and you'll quickly discover that the memory involves solar eclipse glasses, perhaps pinhole cameras. It's a safe bet that the memory is from 2017 -- when North America as a whole witnessed a partial solar eclipse -- though there have been other solar eclipses on the continent in living memory.

A quick way of telling is to find out the location of the memory and use the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database to check for sure.

American

Here's a list -- each linking to an interactive map -- of all the total solar eclipses that have fallen in North America in the last 70 years, according to GreatAmericanEclipse.com. If you weren't inside ""the stripes"" on these specific days, you didn't experience a total solar eclipse. If the dates aren't here, it was a partial solar eclipse.

Next time you meet someone who only thinks they saw a total solar eclipse, ask them when and where it was and what they remember. Ask them to describe totality. Then, break the news to them gently by telling them about what's about to happen on April 8 -- a once-in-a-lifetime total eclipse of the sun where they can finally experience totality and achieve something so few humans ever do.

This time, however, it will be a shared experience for a whopping 42 million people -- including 32 million Americans -- who already live in the path of totality.

Everyone in North America will see a partial solar eclipse on April 8, but only those from within a narrow 115-mile path through parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states and Canada will be able to experience totality.

It will cross parts of five states in Mexico (Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua), 15 U.S. states (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee (northwest corner), Michigan (southeast corner), Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine) and six Canadian Provinces (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland).",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,-0.0117647058823529,448974525,1,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fd4263183a8b781f7df599/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,1125,x0,y223,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds",eng-9413446

""It's about the further expansion of solar farms above our settlement,"" said Armin Dubljevic, a representative of the residents of the Medjine settlement.

""We came here to say that our lives are endangered.""

Residents claim that an Environmental Impact Assessment Study was conducted in 2010, which stated that this was a sloped area where the installation of solar panels was not recommended. They allege that the authorities are ignoring this, as well as unlawfully converting agricultural land into construction land, and selling state-owned land to tycoons, in violation of the law on the prohibition of disposing of state-owned land enacted by the High Representative.

""As a result, they fear that due to new rains, floods and landslides will occur, directly endangering their homes,"" stated the informal citizen group ""Stop Illegal Changes to the Spatial Plan in Mostar"".

The Mayor of Mostar, Mario Kordic, recently, when asked about the residents' opposition to the construction of electro-energy facilities in the mentioned areas, stated that the Spatial Plan was adopted in 2012.

""At that time, those locations were defined quite broadly. It was not known how much capacity there was, it was not known when it would be built, if it would be built, so it all went quite smoothly,"" Kordic claimed.

He believes that the residents' fear is more ""a product of poor communication of those decisions from 2012"", and ""that it is a good thing that Mostar has the opportunity to be a leader in the entire region in the production of energy from renewable sources"", Slobodna Evropa reports.

This follows allegations that the Authority is excessively exporting power to neighbouring countries.

In a press release dated March 24, the VRA indicated that the claim that it is not meeting its power supply obligation to Ghana is erroneous and misleading.

""The VRA wishes to state that since 1972, the Authority has been supplying power to neighbouring countries without reneging on its mandate to deliver reliable and affordable power to Ghana; and this the Authority continues to do,"" parts of the statement read.

""Also, it is important to mention that the allocation of the power generated from the Akosombo and Kpong hydropower stations is supervised by the Electricity Market Oversight Panel (EMOP) and not the VRA,"" the company added.

VRA explained that as a result of this arrangement, the Ghanaian market is always prioritised in power allocation.

This is in accordance with government policies to ensure long-term optimization of the nation's hydro resources, it added.

This comes after the Independent Power Generators, Ghana (IPGG), attributed the current power outages to the Volta River Authority's excessive exportation of electricity to other countries.

Its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Elikplim Kwabla Apetorgbor, pointed out that the VRA is focusing on exporting power to neighboring countries and is therefore not meeting its domestic obligations.

The Government was informed of some 1,800 planned redundancies in the private sector in February, the Business Post reports, the third highest number recorded in a single month since 2021.

The newspaper has obtained fresh data that shows that TikTok, Wayflyer and Flutter are among the list of firms planning to shed jobs this year.

Tech companies, the figures indicate, are still clearly in cost trimming mode, despite comments from Ministers in recent months indicating that the worst of the cuts are behind us.

Meanwhile, separate figures from Dublin recruitment firm Sanderson show job vacancies have also fallen from last year, the paper reports. Taken together, the data is suggestive of a softening in labour market conditions with workers less inclined to look for new roles.

Troubled Irish renewables company Solar 12 is facing fresh delays in its bid to raise funds, the Sunday Independent reports.

The firm, which is in the midst of a High Court approved restructuring, has told investors that it may enter into dispute with the contractors on the site of its decommissioned biomass plant in Yorkshire.

This has delayed Solar 21's plan to get the site up and running by January 2024 and ultimately offload the plant, according to a report to investors.

Management is having ""urgent meetings"" with the contractor, investors have been told.

The Sunday Times reports that US investment firm Northwood is believed to be making an ""aggressive"" bid to acquire Blanchardstown Centre in Dublin 15 from Goldman Sachs.

Although investment group M & , Beauparc founder Eamon Waters and property investment giant Hines are said to still be in the running, Northwood has reportedly tabled a first-round offer in the region of €580 million.

Bidding is in the early stages, the paper reports, after the centre was put on the market with a guide price of between €650 million and €725 million, slightly less than the €750 million Goldman Sachs paid for it in 2020.

Work is now under way again at a luxury apartment scheme being developed by Paddy McKillen jnr's Oakmount property vehicle in Mount Merrion, the Business Post reports.

The project, dubbed the Pinnacle, was originally due for completion in 2023. However, the scheme has faced a number of delays - some due to a change of contractor last year, as reported by The Irish Times - much to the chagrin of local residents.

A spokeswoman for Oakmount told the Post that there is now a full crew on site and work is expected to be completed by the end of the summer.

A Dublin-based company that worked on the production of Disney's blockbuster Shogun series wants to make Ireland a global ""hub"" for visual effects, the Mail on Sunday reports.

SSVFX, a subsidiary of Screen Scene, has also worked on other big-name productions including Game of Thrones and Stranger things.

Its managing director, Jake Walshe, said Irish companies are already working with top-level US clients but the Government can do more incentivise the TV and film production industry in the Republic.

Suppose that when your first child turned nine, a visionary billionaire whom you'd never met chose her to join the first permanent human settlement on Mars. Unbeknown to you, she had signed herself up for the mission because she loves outer space, and, besides, all of her friends have signed up. She begs you to let her go.

You hear her desire, so before saying no, you agree at least to learn more. You learn that the reason they're recruiting children is because they will better adapt to the unusual conditions of Mars than adults. If children go through puberty and its associated growth spurt on Mars, their bodies will be permanently tailored to it, unlike settlers who come over as adults.

You find other reasons for fear. First, there's the radiation, against which Mars does not have a protective shield. And then there's the low‐gravity environment, which would put children at high risk of developing deformities in their skeletons, hearts, eyes, and brains. Did the planners take this vulnerability of children into account? As far as you can tell, no.

So, would you let her go? Of course not. You realise this is a completely insane idea - sending children to Mars, perhaps never to return to Earth. The project leaders do not seem to know anything about child development and do not seem to care about children's safety. Worse still: the company did not require proof of parental permission.

No company could ever take our children away and endanger them without our consent, or they would face massive liabilities. Right?

At the turn of the millennium, technology companies created a set of world-changing products that transformed life not just for adults all over the world but for children, too. Young people had been watching television since the 1950s but the new tech was far more portable, personalised and engaging than anything that came before. Yet the companies that developed them had done little or no research on the mental health effects. When faced with growing evidence that their products were harming young people, they mostly engaged in denial, obfuscation, and public relations campaigns. Companies that strive to maximise ""engagement"" by using psychological tricks to keep young people clicking were the worst offenders. They hooked children during vulnerable developmental stages, while their brains were rapidly rewiring in response to incoming stimulation. This included social media companies, which inflicted their greatest damage on girls, and video game companies and pornography sites, which sank their hooks deepest into boys. By designing a slew of addictive content that entered through kids' eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socialising, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale.

What legal limits have we imposed on these tech companies so far? Virtually none, apart from the requirement for children under 13 to get parental consent before they can sign a contract with a company. But the law in most countries didn't require age verification; so long as a child checked a box to assert that she was old enough (or put in the right fake birthday), she could go almost anywhere on the internet - and sign into any social media app - without her parents' knowledge or consent. (The law is being tightened in the UK, due to the 2023 Online Safety Act, and is under review in the US.)

Thus, the generation born after 1995 - gen Z - became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive and unstable. Succeeding socially in that universe required them to devote a large part of their consciousness to managing what became their online brand, posting carefully curated photographs and videos of their lives. This was now necessary to gain acceptance from peers, the oxygen of adolescence, and to avoid online shaming, the nightmare of adolescence. Gen Z teenagers got sucked into spending many hours of each day scrolling through the shiny happy posts of friends, acquaintances and distant influencers. They watched increasing quantities of user-generated videos and streamed entertainment, fed to them by algorithms that were designed to keep them online as long as possible. They spent far less time playing with, talking to, touching, or even making eye contact with their friends and families, thereby reducing their participation in social behaviour that is essential for successful human development.

The members of gen Z are, therefore, the test subjects for a radical new way of growing up, far from the real‐world interactions of small communities in which humans evolved. Call it the Great Rewiring of Childhood. It's as if they became the first generation to grow up on Mars. And it has turned them into the Anxious Generation.

There was little sign of an impending mental illness crisis among adolescents in the 2000s. Then, quite suddenly, in the early 2010s, things changed. In just five years between 2010 and 2015, across the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and beyond, the number of young people with anxiety, depression and even suicidal tendencies started to rise sharply. Among US teenagers, those who reported experiencing a long period of feeling ""sad, empty, or depressed"" or a long period in which they ""lost interest and became bored with most of the things they usually enjoy"" - classic symptoms of depression - surged by roughly 150%. In other words, mental illness became roughly two and a half times more prevalent. The increases were similar for both sexes and happened across all races and social classes. And among a variety of mental health diagnoses, anxiety rates rose the most.

More recent data for 2020 was collected partly before and partly after the Covid shutdowns, and by then one out of every four American teen girls had experienced a major depressive episode in the previous year. Things got worse in 2021, but the majority of the rise was in place before the pandemic.

I addressed some of these issues in The Coddling of the American Mind, a book [about modern identity politics and hypersensitivity on university campuses] I wrote in 2017 with free speech campaigner Greg Lukianoff. The day after we published, an essay appeared in the New York Times with the headline: ""The Big Myth About Teenage Anxiety."" In it, a psychiatrist raised several important objections to what he saw as a rising moral panic around teenagers and smartphones. He pointed out that most of the studies showing a rise in mental illness were based on ""self‐reports"", which does not necessarily mean that there is a change in underlying rates of mental illness. Perhaps young people just became more willing to self‐diagnose or talk honestly about their symptoms? Or perhaps they started to mistake mild symptoms of anxiety for a mental disorder?

Was the psychiatrist right to be sceptical? He was certainly right that we need to look at multiple indicators to know if mental illness really is increasing. A good way to do that is to look at changes in figures not self‐reported by teens. For example, the number of adolescents brought in for emergency psychiatric care, or admitted to hospitals each year because they deliberately harmed themselves, either in a suicide attempt, or in what is called non‐suicidal self-injury, such as cutting oneself without the intent to die.

The rate of self‐harm for young adolescent girls nearly tripled from 2010 to 2020. The rate for older girls (ages 15-19) doubled, while the rate for women over 24 actually went down during that time. So whatever happened in the early 2010s, it hit preteen and young teen girls harder than any other group. Similarly, the suicide rate for young adolescents increased by 167% from 2010 to 2021.

The rapid increases in rates of self‐harm and suicide, in conjunction with the self‐report studies showing increases in anxiety and depression, offers a strong rebuttal to those who were sceptical about the existence of a mental health crisis. I am not saying that none of the increase in anxiety and depression is due to a greater willingness to report these conditions (which is a good thing) or that some adolescents began pathologising normal anxiety and discomfort (which is not a good thing). But the pairing of self‐reported suffering with behavioural changes tells us that something big changed in the lives of adolescents in the early 2010s.

The arrival of the smartphone in 2007 changed life for everyone. Of course, teenagers had mobile phones since the late 1990s, but they were basic flip phones with no internet access, mostly useful for communicating directly with friends and family, one‐on‐one. Some adolescents had internet access via a home computer or laptop but it wasn't till they got smartphones that they could be online all the time, even when away from home. According to a survey conducted by the US non-profit group Common Sense Media, by 2016, 79% of teens owned a smartphone, as did 28% of children between the ages of eight and 12.

As teenagers got smartphones, they began spending more time in the virtual world. A Common Sense report, in 2015, found that teens with a social media account reported spending about two hours a day on social media and around seven hours a day of leisure time online. Another 2015 report, by the Washington thinktank Pew Research, reveals that one out of every four teens said that they were online ""almost constantly"". By 2022, that number had nearly doubled, to 46%. These ""almost constantly"" numbers are startling, and may be the key to explaining the sudden collapse of adolescent mental health. These extraordinarily high rates suggest that even when members of gen Z are not on their devices and appear to be doing something in the real world, such as sitting in class, eating a meal, or talking to you, a substantial portion of their attention is monitoring or worrying (being anxious) about events in the social metaverse. As the MIT professor Sherry Turkle wrote in 2015 about life with smartphones: ""We are forever elsewhere.""

Faced with so many virtual activities, social media platforms and video streaming channels, many adolescents (and adults) lost the ability to be fully present with the people around them, which changed social life for everyone, even for the small minority that did not use these platforms. Social patterns, role models, emotions, physical activity, and even sleep patterns were fundamentally recast, for adolescents, over the course of just five years.

When I present these findings in public, someone often objects by saying something like: ""Of course young people are depressed - just look at the state of the world in the 21st century. It began with the 9/11 attacks, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the global financial crisis. They're growing up with global warming, school shootings in the US and elsewhere, political polarisation, inequality, and ever-rising student loan debt. Not to mention wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.""

But while I agree that the 21st century is off to a bad start, the timing does not support the argument that gen Z is anxious and depressed because of rising national or global threats. Even if we were to accept the premise that the events from 9/11 through to the global financial crisis had substantial effects on adolescent mental health, they would have most heavily affected the millennial generation (born between 1981 and 1995), who found their world shattered and their prospects for upward mobility reduced. But this did not happen; their rates of mental illness did not worsen during their teenage years. Also, had the financial crisis and other economic concerns been major contributors, adolescent mental health would have plummeted in 2009, the darkest year of the financial crisis, and it would have improved throughout the 2010s as the unemployment rate fell, the stock market rose, and the global economy heated up.

There is just no way to pin the surge of adolescent anxiety and depression on any economic event or trend that I can find.

When Covid arrived in 2020, the disease and the lockdowns made sociogenic illness more likely among people of any age. Covid was a global threat and a stressor. The lockdowns led teens to spend even more time on social media, especially TikTok, which was relatively new. But the steep rise in anxiety and depression among adolescents was in place well before the pandemic.

The other explanation I often hear is that gen Z is anxious and depressed because of climate change, which will affect their lives more than those of older generations. Their concern is legitimate, but impending threats to a nation or generation (as opposed to an individual) do not historically cause rates of mental illness to rise. When countries are attacked, either by military force or by terrorism, citizens usually rally around the flag and one another. They are infused with a strong sense of purpose and suicide rates drop. When young people rally together around a political cause, from opposing the Vietnam war in the 1960s through peak periods of earlier climate activism in the 1970s and 1990s, they become energised, not dispirited or depressed.

People don't get depressed when they face threats collectively; they get depressed when they feel isolated, lonely, or useless.

Parents I talk to about smartphones, social media and video games tell stories of ""constant conflict"". They try to lay down rules and enforce limits, but there are so many arguments about why a rule needs to be relaxed, and so many ways around the rules, that family life all over the world has come to be dominated by disagreements about technology. Maintaining family rituals such as mealtimes can feel like resisting an ever-rising tide.

A mother I spoke with in Boston told me about the efforts she and her husband had made to keep their 14- year-old daughter, Emily, away from Instagram. They could see the damaging effect it was having on her. To curb her access, they tried various ways to monitor and limit the app on her phone. However, life became a permanent struggle in which Emily eventually found ways around the restrictions. In one episode, she got into her mother's phone, disabled the monitoring software, and threatened to kill herself if her parents reinstalled it. Her mother told me:

""It feels like the only way to remove social media and the smartphone from her life is to move to a deserted island. She attended summer camp for six weeks each summer where no phones were permitted - no electronics at all. When we picked her up from camp she was her normal self. But as soon as she started using her phone again it was back to the same agitation and glumness.""

Platforms such as Instagram - where users post content about themselves, then wait for the judgments and comments of others, and the social comparison that goes with it - have larger and more harmful effects on girls and young women than on boys and young men. The more time a girl spends on social media, the more likely she is to be depressed or anxious. Girls who say that they spend five or more hours each weekday on social media are three times as likely to be depressed as those who report no social media time. The difference is far less marked with boys. Girls spend more time on social media, and the platforms they are on - particularly Instagram and Snapchat - are the worst for mental health. A 2017 study in the UK asked teenage girls to rate the effects of the most popular social media platforms on different parts of their wellbeing, including anxiety, loneliness, body image, and sleep. Teenagers rated Instagram as the worst of the big five apps, followed by Snapchat. YouTube was the only platform that received a positive overall score.

The 2021 song Jealousy, Jealousy by Olivia Rodrigo sums up what it's like for many girls to scroll through social media today. The song begins: ""I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room/ 'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true."" Rodrigo then says that ""co-comparison"" with the perfect bodies and paper-white teeth of girls she doesn't know is slowly killing her.

Psychologists have long studied social comparison and its pervasive effects. The American social psychologist Mark Leary says it's as if we all have a ""sociometer"" in our brains - a gauge that runs from nought to 100, telling us where we stand in the local prestige rankings. When the needle drops, it triggers an alarm - anxiety - that motivates us to change our behaviour and get the needle back up. So what happened when most girls in a school got Instagram and Snapchat accounts and started posting carefully edited highlight reels of their lives and using filters and editing apps to improve their virtual beauty and online brand? Many girls' sociometers plunged, because most were now below what appeared to them to be the average. All around the developed world, an anxiety alarm went off in girls' minds, at approximately the same time.

A 13-year-old girl on Reddit explained how seeing other girls on social media made her feel, using similar words to Olivia Rodrigo:

i cant stop comparing myself. it came to a point where i wanna kill myself cause u dont want to look like this and no matter what i try im still ugly/feel ugly. i constantly cry about this. it probably started when i was 10, im now 13. back when i was 10 i found a girl on tiktok and basically became obsessed with her. she was literally perfect and i remember being unimaginably envious of her. throughout my pre-teen years, i became ""obsessed"" with other pretty girls.

Instagram's owner, Facebook (now Meta), itself commissioned a study on how Instagram was affecting teens in the US and the UK. The findings were never released, but whistleblower Frances Haugen smuggled out screenshots of internal documents and shared them with reporters at the Wall Street Journal. The researchers found that Instagram is particularly bad for girls: ""Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression... This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.""

If we confine ourselves to examining data about depression, anxiety, and self-harm, we'd conclude that the Great Rewiring has been harder on girls than on boys. But there's plenty of evidence that boys are suffering too.

A key factor was boys taking up online multiplayer video games in the late 2000s and smartphones in the early 2010s, both of which pulled them decisively away from face-to-face or shoulder-to-shoulder interaction. At that point, I think we see signs of a ""mass psychological breakdown"". Or, at least, a mass psychological change. Once boys had multiple internet-connected devices, many of them got lost in cyberspace, which made them more fragile, fearful, and risk averse on Earth. Beginning the early 2010s, boys across the western world began showing concerning declines in their mental health. By 2015, a staggering number of them said that they had no close friends, that they were lonely, and that there was no meaning or direction to their lives.

The overwhelming feeling I get from the families of both boys and girls is that they are trapped and powerless in the face of the biggest mental health crisis in history for their children. What should they - what should we - do?

When I say that we need to delay the age at which children get smartphones and social media accounts, the most common response is: ""I agree with you, but it's too late."" It has become so ordinary for 11-year-olds to walk around staring at their phones, swiping through bottomless feeds, that many people cannot imagine that we could change it if we wanted to. ""That ship has sailed,"" they tell me.

Yet we are not helpless. It often feels that way because smartphones, social media, market forces, and social influence combine to pull us into a trap that social scientists call a collective action problem. Children starting secondary school are trapped in a collective action problem when they arrive for their first day and see that some of their classmates have smartphones and are connecting on Instagram and Snapchat, even during class time. That puts pressure on them to get a smartphone and social media as well.

It's painful for parents to hear their children say: ""Everyone else has a smartphone. If you don't get me one, I'll be excluded from everything."" Many parents therefore give in and buy their child a smartphone at age 11, or younger. As more parents relent, pressure grows on the remaining kids and parents, until the community reaches a stable but unfortunate equilibrium: Everyone really does have a smartphone.

How do we escape from these traps? Collective action problems require collective responses: parents can support one another by sticking together. There are four main types of collective response, and each can help us to bring about major change:

1. No smartphones before year 10

Parents should delay children's entry into round-the-clock internet access by giving only basic phones with limited apps and no internet browser before the age of 14.

2. No social media before 16

Let children get through the most vulnerable period of brain development before connecting them to an avalanche of social comparison and algorithmically chosen influencers.

3. Phone-free schools

Schools must insist that students store their phones, smartwatches, and any other devices in phone lockers during the school day, as per the new non-statutory guidance issued by the UK government. That is the only way to free up their attention for one another and for their teachers.

4. Far more unsupervised play and childhood independence

That's the way children naturally develop social skills, overcome anxiety, and become self-governing young adults.

These four reforms are not hard to implement - if many of us do them at the same time. They cost almost nothing. They will work even if we never get help from our legislators or from the tech giants, which continue to resist pressure to protect young users' safety and wellbeing. If most of the parents and schools in a community were to enact all four, I believe they would see substantial improvements in adolescent mental health within two years.

United States federal agencies have launched the Clean Energy Connector pilot, a tool connecting families to solar energy through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

The platform is a partnership between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

According to a statement by the DOE, Clean Energy Connector is a first-of-its-kind software, which can now be used by local LIHEAP program administrators in Illinois, Washington, D.C., and New Mexico to connect community solar subscriptions to as many as 40,000 households with low income.

""Renewable energy is by far the cheapest form of power and now, thanks to innovative solutions developed under the Biden-Harris Administration, more households across America can access the health and savings benefits that solar power provides"", said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. ""DOE's partnership with HHS will increase the deployment of community solar, helping thousands of families lower their energy bills and in turn reduce their energy burden, ensuring Americans across the nation are included as we transition to a clean energy economy"".

""LIHEAP keeps families and individuals safe and healthy by providing heating assistance in the winter and cooling assistance in the summer"", said Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. ""Connecting LIHEAP-eligible households with the benefits and bill-savings of community solar will also have a lasting impact and provide increased economic security for families"".

Following the announcement of the software's development in 2022, this initiative will facilitate up to 40,000 eligible households under LIHEAP across two pilot states and Washington, D.C. to participate in community solar projects. Enrolled participants who successfully join the program may see significant savings on their electricity bills, aligning with the National Community Solar Partnership's objective of achieving 20 percent household savings, equivalent to an annual amount of $370 per household.

In numerous states, solar energy is now more cost-effective than traditional utility bill rates, the DOE said. Community solar, which enables multiple customers to benefit from a shared solar energy system, offers an opportunity for individuals who are unable to install rooftop solar panels to reduce their utility expenses and access additional advantages.

""We can't claim to be serious about a clean energy future until it's an option for everyone, not just those with the extra resources available to invest in technologies like solar. This program will expand solar to families who will see the most benefit from lower energy bills and place an equitable focus on clean energy distribution, an essential part of a sustainable future that I'm grateful the Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing"", Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said.

Roughly 5.7 million households in the U.S. benefit from LIHEAP aid for heating expenses, the DOE said. LIHEAP offers support to eligible households for heating and cooling expenses, home weatherization, and energy-related home repairs. The shift to solar energy has the potential to help households nationwide reduce their electricity costs, it said. However, numerous American families encounter obstacles in accessing these benefits, such as subscription fees, the DOE said.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.6784313725490196,448974168,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/New-US-Initiative-to-Connect-LowIncome-Households-to-Community-Solar-176172-582x327.webp,

Interest rate and economically sensitive sectors, like banks, received a more significant boost. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed sharply last week.

In response to Powell's comments, the 10-year and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields declined to 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively. The swift decline in yields caused the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index to appreciate 0.7% for the week. In addition, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed the less sensitive consumer staples by a significant margin.

As widely expected, the Fed kept short-term interest rates unchanged at last week's meeting. In a mild dovish surprise, the median Fed forecast for three interest rate cuts in 2023 remained unchanged despite the recent hotter inflation readings. Fed forecasts for PCE inflation and economic growth were revised higher, while jobless rate estimates were reduced.

Recall that February consumer inflation (CPI) was higher than expected at a 3.2% year-over-year pace. The supercore measure of services inflation, which removes the distortion from the overstated government measure of rent inflation, held steady at 4.3% year-over-year. In his comments, Powell said that the Fed is progressing to its 2% inflation objective ""over time"" and that the inflation trend is lower despite the ""bumpy path.""

Powell noted that he did not think higher wages were the cause of elevated inflation. He believed that the labor market imbalances were mostly resolved and that wage growth was moderating to sustainable levels.

Most importantly, he seemed to indicate that the Fed would be more likely to cut if there was unexpected weakness in the job market versus holding rates steady if inflation remained somewhat elevated. Consistent with the most recent data for unemployment benefit claims, the Fed statement noted that ""job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.""

In reaction to Powell's rate cut-friendly comments, markets have now priced in an 85% chance of a Fed easing in June, up from 60% in the prior week. Odds now clearly favor a June or July start to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate cuts. Fed Fund futures are looking for three cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) each in 2024.

Risk assets rose sharply due to the indication that the Federal Reserve would likely be more sensitive to economic softness than elevated inflation. Based on the solid performance of economically sensitive stocks in the wake of the Fed meeting, markets have lowered the probability of recession as the hurdle for the Fed to ease monetary conditions is lower than previously thought. While there is no reason to doubt the market's view on recession, the increased expectation does add to risk in the markets if there are disappointments. While Powell dismisses the risk of wage growth bleeding into services inflation, that seems to be the area to watch most closely for future possible issues. The holiday-shortened trading week should not contain any significant market-moving releases, but several Fed speakers are on the calendar.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.4509803921568627,448974045,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65feeb28a07fa0bd79da3ddb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,zho-1581798

In this article we'll learn what it is, when and how to use it.

Enhanced Debugging Capabilities

The process namespace sharing enabled by the squash flag offers an unparalleled window into the live environment of a running container. This shared namespace approach means that any tools or commands executed within the debugging container have the same view of system resources (e.g., processes, network interfaces) as the target container. This capability is indispensable for diagnosing issues that are not reproducible outside of the container's unique runtime environment or for investigating intermittent problems that require observing the application under specific conditions.

Practical Workflow Integration

Integrating the use of the squash flag into your development and operational workflows enhances your team's ability to quickly respond to and resolve issues. By establishing a standardized approach to initiating debugging sessions with the squash flag, teams can reduce the time spent on setup and configuration, focusing instead on the investigation itself. For instance, creating a shared repository of debugging scripts or tool configurations that can be quickly deployed into a debugging container can streamline the diagnosis process.

Use Cases

Beyond basic process observation and file system exploration, the squash flag facilitates advanced debugging techniques, such as:

Debugging in Kubernetes can sometimes feel like a daunting task, especially when dealing with issues that only manifest in a live environment. The command, when used with the squash flag, provides a powerful yet non-intrusive means to diagnose and troubleshoot containerized applications without affecting their operational state. This tutorial walks you through the practical application of the squash flag for real-world debugging scenarios.

Identifying the Target Container for Debugging

The first step in any debugging process is identifying the problematic component. In Kubernetes, this usually means pinpointing the specific pod and container exhibiting the issue.

This command lists all the pods running in the current namespace, providing a starting point for narrowing down your target.

Initiating a Debugging Session with the Squash Flag

Once you've identified the pod in question, it's time to initiate a debugging session using the squash flag. This flag allows you to create a temporary container within the same namespace and process namespace as the target container, facilitating direct debugging without disturbance.

Replace with the name of the pod you're targeting. This command spins up a new container that shares the process namespace with the container being debugged, allowing you to inspect and interact with its processes directly.

Interacting with the Debugging Environment

Inside the temporary debugging container, you're equipped with a fresh environment where you can install and utilize various debugging tools without any risk to the target container's integrity or performance.

Scenario: Investigating High CPU Usage

Suppose you've noticed that a container in your application is consistently using more CPU resources than expected. To investigate, you might choose to install and use performance analysis tools like or .

These commands (for Debian-based containers) install , a visual process viewer, and then run it to observe CPU usage in real-time. You could identify runaway processes or threads contributing to the high CPU load.

Scenario: Debugging Network Issues

If the container is experiencing network communication issues, you might want to inspect open network connections and traffic.

provides a snapshot of current network connections, which can be invaluable for diagnosing issues like unexpected ports in use or connections in a state.

Exiting the Debugging Session

After you've completed your investigation and gathered the necessary insights, simply exit the debugging container.

Exiting the container triggers Kubernetes to automatically clean up the debugging environment, leaving your original container and its operations unaffected.

Scenario: Tracing Latency in Microservice Communication

In a microservices architecture, tracing latency issues can be challenging. Using the squash flag, you can attach a tracing tool like to the process of interest to monitor system calls and signals.

Replace with the Process ID of the service experiencing latency. This real-time tracing can uncover delays in system calls, offering clues to the underlying issue.

To maximize the effectiveness of debugging sessions using the squash flag, consider the following best practices:

The squash flag in Kubernetes debugging sessions represents a potent tool in the arsenal of developers and operators working with containerized applications. By facilitating non-intrusive and in-depth investigation capabilities, it significantly simplifies the troubleshooting process in complex Kubernetes environments. Mastery of the squash flag and the broader Kubernetes debugging toolkit empowers teams to maintain high application reliability and performance.",overcast.blog,news,Medium,,0.0117647058823529,448973837,1,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:921/1*zANMcKGjiVuFZTClvucmFg.png,

The party's request was turned down in view of the ""law and order situation"". DC Memon stated that the party had already violated NOCs (no objection certificates) issued on earlier occasions.

Two days prior, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq instructed the capital's Deputy Commissioner to address the issue and submit a report accordingly, as per The Express Tribune.

The request for permission for a public gathering on either March 23 or 30, at Parade Ground, F9 Park, or D Chowk at 10 pm, was made by the regional president of the former ruling party, Amir Masood Mughal.

According to The Express Tribune, the secretary of interior, chief commissioner, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner, and SSP operations were addressed in the application.

It demanded the law enforcement agencies refrain from blocking the routes to the venue and abstain from arresting or baton-charging party supporters.

The PTI submitted formal written requests to the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner on March 15 and 18 to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but received no response until March 21.

Later, Imran's party approached the court after alleging that the district administration was unresponsive to their request, therefore, the court should issue directions in this regard.

The PTI also faced similar rejections earlier, as the Rawalpindi District Administration declined the party's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh on February 5, right before the crucial general elections.

District Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema rejected the PTI's request to hold a rally at Liaquat Bagh, saying that it was not possible to allow the party to hold a rally in the city as it might affect the law and order situation.

How does the divestment by IOCs impact Nigeria's oil and gas industry?

The divestment by International Oil Companies (IOCs) in Nigeria's oil and gas industry has multifaceted impacts on the country's economy, energy security, and the industry as a whole. On the one hand, divestment may lead to a decrease in foreign direct investment and technological expertise, potentially impacting production levels and revenue generation. This could also affect employment opportunities and local content development within the industry.

Moreover, the divestment may pose challenges to Nigeria's energy security, as it could reduce the involvement of IOCs in exploration and production activities, potentially leading to a decline in reserves replacement and production capacity.

Also, the divestment could trigger shifts in the ownership and operation of oil and gas assets, impacting the competitive landscape and government revenues derived from the sector. The divestment phenomenon is not unheard of. This happened in the North Sea region giving rise to virile small and midsized oil and gas companies. Some of these companies are currently competing at a considerable scale. As such, with the right policy and regulatory interventions, the situation is not a doomsday scenario for the industry.

What challenges does Nigeria face in attracting new investment to offset the divestment by the IOCs?

Nigeria faces hurdles in attracting new investment to offset divestment by IOCs in its oil and gas industry. Addressing environmental, social, and governance issues while enhancing transparency would boost confidence. Infrastructure deficiencies hinder operations and investment attractiveness. Security concerns, especially in oil-producing regions, must be addressed to reassure investors. Promoting diversification and sustainability, including incentivising renewable energy investments and broadening the appeal.

Overall, concerted efforts from government, industry stakeholders, and finance sectors are needed to create an enabling environment for sustainable energy sector development and investment in Nigeria.

Tell us the significance of the Oloibiri Lecture and Energy Forum and its impact on Nigeria's energy industry.

There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

Why could Roblox be a once-in-a-generation opportunity?

Metaverse technology is still in its relative infancy. The global metaverse industry is just starting to gain serious traction. According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Massive long-term potential

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

The bottom line

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Massive long-term potential

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

The bottom line

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.

Mitchell capped off a magnificent run through the ""Snake Pit"" at Innisbrook on Saturday with a shot he never saw go in. His 7-iron from the 18th fairway one-hopped into the hole for eagle and a 5 under and a two-shot.

Mitchell was among a dozen players on the fringe of contention at a tournament so tight that it began with all 77 players who made the cut separated by a mere six shots.

That changed when he went 3-2-2 through the closing stretch of the Copperhead course, the first player to do that in tournament history. Mitchell holed a birdie putt just inside 15 feet on the 16th hole, hit 6-iron to inside 3 feet for birdie on the par-3 17th and then holed out on the 18th hole with a 7-iron from about 151 yards up a steep hill.

Mitchell, who needs a win to get into the Masters, has reason to feel the finish line feels a lot longer away than just 18 holes.

It was super packed at the start, and even with a two-shot lead, Saturday was a reminder how quickly it can change at Innisbrook and with so many players in the mix.

""No matter how well you played, it was going to be tough to get much better than 4, 5 under, I thought,"" Power said. ""It's tough to get away from the pack, so it's going to be some guys in with a chance.""

Power added: ""You got to drive it well, it's difficult when you're not in the fairways. And if you hit the greens, they're grainy and they're tricky and they're slopey. You got to hit it in the right spots and try to make some putts on greens like that. I think it tests all aspects of the game. I think that's why it's such a good golf course.

""I think they're going two balls tomorrow, so maybe some guys that get out early will have a chance to post something. So we'll see. Anything can happen, depends on conditions obviously as well. I'll look at the stats again after today, but through two rounds it's like pretty steady, there was no major weaknesses. I hit a lot of good putts, which was cool, a lot of good speed putts, so maybe some of those drop in tomorrow, give myself a chance.""

Power made birdies at No 6 and No 7 before giving one back on 9. However he birdied the par-five 12th and par-three 15th to put him in the mix.

Victory at Innsbrook would stamp Power's papers for Augusta as he bids to snap out of a injury-beset period that has seen him fall to 103rd in the world.",irishexaminer.com,news,Irish Examiner,Darragh Leen,0.2313725490196079,448973690,1,https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8078/4039015_2_articlelarge_GettyImages-2107592460_1_.jpg,eng-9420877

Mother Dairy, a leading milk supplier in Delhi-NCR, has nine company-owned dairy processing plants with a total capacity of more than 50 lakh litres per day.

Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd MD Manish Bandlish said, ""Summer is the most anticipated season for our business, especially for categories like ice creams, curd and beverages"".

""With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD's) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multi-fold surge in demand for these categories,"" he added.

Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year.

The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to ₹50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

""As we get into the season, we are all geared up to excite consumers in our golden jubilee year with an array of over 30 new delightful products. The upcoming range will feature around 20 new ice cream products, followed by Greek yoghurts and other dairy products,"" Bandlish said.

Overall, he said the company is very optimistic about the season.

""We expect the demand towards our dairy products to strengthen by 25-30 per cent over the last season's demand,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy has also announced its expansion plan for dairy and fruits and vegetables (F&V) businesses.

The company will invest ₹650 crore to set up two new plants for processing milk and fruits and vegetables.

It will also invest another ₹100 crore to expand the capacities of its existing plants, taking the total capex to ₹750 crore.

""In our endeavour to expand our distribution and reach to our consumers, we have earmarked a capital expenditure (capex) outlay of over ₹750 crore to enhance our dairy and F&V processing capacities across key locations,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy is coming up with a big dairy plant in Nagpur with an investment of around ₹525 crore.

The greenfield plant will have a processing capacity of six lakh litres of milk per day.

""We also plan to commission a new fruit processing plant in Karnataka with an investment of over ₹125 crore under our Safal brand,"" Bandlish said.

These two plants are likely to be completed in about two years.

For the horticulture (fruits and vegetables) segment, the company has its own four plants, while for edible oils it manufactures through fifteen associated plants.

Mother Dairy's turnover in 2022-23 stood at around ₹14,500 crore.

On the expected turnover for this fiscal, Bandlish said, ""Despite a challenging year and subdued summer season last year, deflation in the edible oil sector, the company is likely to exit 2023-24 with a moderate growth rate of around 7-8 per cent in volume terms"".

Mother Dairy was commissioned in 1974. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

Mother Dairy was established under the initiative of 'Operation Flood', the world's biggest dairy development programme, launched to make India a milk-sufficient nation.

Mother Dairy, one of the leading dairy players in India, manufactures, markets and sells milk and milk products, including cultured products, ice creams, paneer, ghee, etc under the 'Mother Dairy' brand.

The company also has a diversified portfolio with products in edible oils under the 'Dhara brand, fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen vegetables & snacks, unpolished pulses, pulps & concentrates, etc. under the 'Safal brand.

The parklands are part of the asserted traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation which includes lands around the Bulkley River, Burns Lake, Broman Lake, and François Lake in the northwestern Central Interior of British Columbia.

The Wetʼsuwetʼen are part of the Dakelh or Carrier First Nation, and in combination with the Babine First Nation are referred to as the Western Carrier. They speak Witsuwitʼen, a dialect of the Babine-Witsuwitʼen language which, like its sister language Carrier, is a member of the Athabaskan family.

Their oral history or kungax recounts a time when their ancestral village, Dizkle or Dzilke, once stood upstream from the Bulkley Canyon. This cluster of cedar houses on both sides of the river was said to be abandoned because of an omen of impending disaster. The exact location of the village has been lost but their stories live on.

The neighbouring Gitxsan, collectively the People of Smooth Waters -- the Gilseyhu Big Frog Clan, the Laksilyu Small Frog Clan, the Tsayu Beaver Clan, the Gitdumden Wolf and Bear Clan and the Laksamshu Fireweed and Owl Clan -- each phratry or kinship group calling the Lax Yip home -- 33,000 km2 of land and water in northwestern British Columbia along the waters of the Skeena River and its tributaries -- have a similar tale -- though the village in their versions is referred to as Dimlahamid or Temlahan depending on which house group or wilp is sharing the tale -- as well as where they are located as dialects differ.

Gitksan speak Sim'algax -- the real or true language. Within the Gitxsan communities there are two slightly different dialects. The Gyeets (Downriver) dialect spoken in Gijigyukwhla (Gitsegukla), Gitwangax, and Gitanyow -- and the Gigeenix (Upriver) dialect is spoken in Ansbayaxw (Kispiox), Sik-E-Dakh and Gitanmaax.

Nestled within these lands are the Driftwood Canyon Fossil Beds which record life in the earliest portion of the Eocene when British Columbia -- and indeed our world -- was much warmer than it is today. This site was discovered in the beginning of the 20th century and is now recognized as containing significant fossil material.

The fossils found here -- and their superb preservation -- provide a fascinating opportunity to understand the area's evolutionary processes of both geology and biology over the past fifty million years or so. The fossils themselves are 51.7 million years old and look remarkably like many of the species we recognize today.

The park that contains these beautiful fossils is fifty-seven years old. It was created in 1967 by the generosity of the late Gordon Harvey (1913-1976). He donated the land to protect fossil resources that he truly loved and wanted to see preserved. The fossil beds are on the east side of Driftwood Creek.

Exploring the region today, we see a landscape dominated by conifers blanketing the area. Forests teem with the aromatic Western Red Cedar, Pacific Silver Fir with its many medicinal properties, the tall and lanky Subalpine Fir with its soft, brittle and quickly decaying wood, the slender scaly Lodgepole Pine, the graceful and slightly forlorn looking Western Hemlock.

Across the landscape you see several species of Spruce, including the impressive Sitka. Some of the tallest on view would have been mere seedlings, colonizing the glacial moraines centuries ago when the glaciers retreated. Collectively, these conifers tell the tale of the region's cool climate today and give this area an earthy, umami scent as only old rainforests can.

The Gitxsan territory boasts seven of the 14 biogeoclimatic zones of the province -- the Alpine Tundra, Spruce-Willow-Birch, Boreal White and Black Spruce, Sub-Boreal Pine-Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce, Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir and Interior Cedar-Hemlock.

The fossil material we find here speaks to a warmer climate in this region's past. We find fossil plants, fish -- including specimens of salmon, suckerfish and bowfin, a type of air breathing fish -- and insect fossil here -- wasps and water striders -- fossil plants including Metasequoia, the Dawn Redwood, alder -- and interesting vertebrate material. Bird feathers are infrequently collected from the shales; however, two bird body fossils have been found here.

In 1968, a bird body fossil was collected in the Eocene shales of the Ootsa Lake Group in Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park by Pat Petley of Kamloops.

Pat donated the specimen in 2000 to the Thompson Rivers University (TRU) palaeontology collections. This fossil bird specimen is tentatively identified as the puffbird, Piciformes bucconidae, of the genus Primobucco.

Primobucco is an extinct genus of bird placed in its own family, Primobucconidae. The type species, Primobucco mcgrewi, lived during the Lower Eocene of North America. It was initially described by American paleo-ornithologist Pierce Brodkorb in 1970, from a fossil right-wing, and thought to be an early puffbird. However, the discovery of a further 12 fossils in 2010 indicate that it is instead an early type of roller.

Related fossils from the European Messel deposits have been assigned to the two species P. perneri and P. frugilegus. Two specimens of P. frugilegus have been found with seeds in the area of their digestive tract, which suggests that these birds were more omnivorous than the exclusively predaceous modern rollers.

Another fossil bird, complete with feathers, was collected at Driftwood Canyon in 1970, This one was found by Margret and Albrecht Klöckner who were travelling from Germany. Theirs is a well-travelled specimen, having visited many sites in BC as they toured around, then to Germany and finally back to British Columbia when it was repatriated and donated to the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria.

This second bird fossil is of a long-legged water bird and has been tentatively identified by Dr. Gareth Dyke of the University of Southampton as possibly from the order Charadriiformes, a diverse order of small to medium-ish water birds that include 350 species of gulls, plovers, sandpipers, terns, snipes, and waders. Hopefully, we'll hear more on this find in the future.

The outcrops at Driftwood Canyon are also special because they record a record of some of the first fossil mammals ever to be found in British Columbia at this pivotal point in time.

Wee proto-hedgehogs smaller than your thumb lived in the undergrowth of that fossil flora. They shared the forest floor with an extinct tapir-like herbivore in the genus Heptodon that looked remarkably similar to his modern, extant cousins (there is a rather cheeky fellow shown here so you get the idea) but lacked their pronounced snout (proboscis). I am guessing that omission made him the more fetching of his lineage.

In both cases, it was a fossilized jaw bone that was recovered from the mud, silt and volcanic ash outcrops in this ancient lakebed site. And these two cuties are significant -- they are the very first fossil mammals we've ever found from the early Eocene south of the Arctic.

How can we be sure of the timing? The fossil outcrops here are found within an ancient lakebed. Volcanic eruptions 51 million years ago put loads of fine dust into the air that settled then sank to the bottom of the lake, preserving the specimens that found their way here -- leaves, insects, birds, mammals.

As well as turning the lake into a fossil making machine -- water, ash, loads of steady sediment to cover specimens and stave off predation -- the volcanic ash contains the very chemically inert -- resistant to mechanical weathering -- mineral zircon which we can date with uranium/lead (U/Pb).

The U/Pb isotopic dating technique is wonderfully accurate and mighty helpful in dating geologic events from volcanic eruptions, continental movements to mass extinctions. This means we know exactly when these lovelies were fossilized and, in turn, the weight of their significance.",science20.com,news,Science 2.0,,-0.07450980392156858,448973442,1,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiC1mQeUKc532HPjmo5HDgJzL6oU1Sb8U7amZ-MJJCbMpptl2zJ84SLkn728Xf7T1TumQFtGm8yYBC82MmqngUOdUCctENvggeLKmZSGgwg-jxNQyVEcd-8ElbqLtVvUV-zyqYbVkibMX1UkF6BTt7FFcqlE5ac2NAXidW0e3W6w5-aq4fqKLUtK5LrzRM/w371-h198/Tapir.png,

And doughnuts that capture the sun's disappearing act with the help of buttercream frosting.

With April 8's total solar eclipse right around the corner, businesses are ready for the celestial event that will dim skies along a generous path across North America.

There are oodles of special eclipse safety glasses for sale, along with T-shirts emblazoned with clever slogans and other souvenirs -- just like the last time the U.S. got a big piece of the total solar eclipse action in 2017.

Hotels and resorts along the prime path are luring in visitors with special packages and Southwest and Delta are selling seats on eclipse-viewing flights. Cities, museums and parks are staging watch parties to draw in tourists as well as residents.

""This is a special event and ... the travel industry certainly is in a very good spot,"" said Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland's business school. She also noted the eclipse craze arrives at a time when consumers are continuing to ramp up spending on new experiences.

Closer to eclipse day, there are likely to be more special products and promotions from national brands springing up, like Moon Pie's ""eclipse survival kit,"" made up of four mini versions of the chocolate snack and two pairs of eclipse glasses.

Small businesses within the eclipse's 115-mile-wide path of totality appear to be leading the charge so far. Online shops and local vendors have put together a full array of creative, limited-edition merchandise: earrings, baby onesies, ornaments, games, banners and more.

Some towns and business owners have been anticipating the celestial event and huge crowds for years.

After the 2017 eclipse, ""I marked my calendar,"" said Sam McNulty, co-founder of Market Garden Brewery in Cleveland, which is in the eclipse path this time and will see nearly four minutes of dimmed skies.

Last year, McNulty's team brewed a hazy IPA called ""The Totality"" to help drum up interest in the eclipse. The on tap debut was a success, and the brewery was soon approached by local grocer Heinen's to partner for a canned collaboration.

In the coming weeks, ""thousands and thousands"" of cans are set to hit store shelves, McNulty said -- adding they decided to go big because of how rare the event is. Cleveland won't be in the path of totality again for a long time -- not until 2444.

""I don't want to have to wait 420 years to brew the next batch of cans,"" he joked. ""So we made a very large one this time.""

The eclipse-themed beverages don't stop at beer. Big Cuppa, a coffee shop in Morrilton, Arkansas, also has a full eclipse menu with a handful of specialty drinks. Its ""Moon Pie Frappa"" is a blended Moon Pie drink flavored with dark chocolate and toasted marshmallow.

Big Cuppa co-owner Joseph Adam Krutz said that he's excited to greet customers and the many new faces set to travel through town next month. Krutz said his shop has been gearing up for a while along with other businesses in downtown Morrilton. He drives by a countdown clock each day.

""We're prepared. Bring it on,"" Krutz said.

And don't forget the snacks. In Ohio's Butler County, a shop called The Donut Dude will have an ""Eclipse Donut Special"" that shows the eclipse's stages as the sun disappears behind the moon.

The special goes on sale later this month and consists of seven filled-doughnuts with rolled buttercream, two galaxy-themed cake doughnuts and safety glasses so customers can watch the event while snacking away.

""We're anticipating a lot of fun,"" co-owner Glen Huey said.

Since the doughnut shop is closed on Mondays, Huey is looking forward to watching the spectacle as it passes over his town between Cincinnati and Dayton.

In the U.S., Texas has the best odds for clear skies and the state expects to be swarmed with tourists. With a prime location, eateries in the town of Grapevine have a multitude of offerings: a ""Blackout Dinner"" at Hotel Vin and a ""Solar Eclipse Shake"" at Son of a Butcher.

Many businesses along the path of totality are offering special events leading up to the eclipse, too.

New York's Cayuga Lake Wine Trail is promoting ""Sips to the Eclipse"" for the weekend ahead of April 8. Guests will be able to visit 10 wineries for tastings -- some of which are offering additional attractions like an eclipse eve tarot card reading, special slushies and half-moon cookies.

Katherine Chase, executive director of the wine trail, said the promotion was planned in anticipation of all the people coming to the Finger Lakes region for the eclipse.

""The wineries can go as big or as little as they'd like to entice folks to come,"" she said.

Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman had previously talked to ex-Navy SEAL David Goggins about how the phenomenon worked. Now, in a recent Q&A session in Melbourne, he laid down the research behind the effects of willpower on an individual's brain.

Stanford's Dr. Josef Parvizi experimented on the will to persevere through electric stimulations to the brain. He found out that an individual's ability to overcome challenges affects their anterior mid-singulate cortex. This meant that any challenging task would directly affect a particular part of the brain, getting it active and running.

Dr. Huberman elaborated on the study, explaining its workings. Although we know, through research, that a particular part of the human brain gets active under tough external circumstances, its significance and impact hold more importance in this study.

The anterior mid-singulate cortex is the hub of the brain. It controls the input from various body parts to the brain, and vice-versa, it accesses dopamine and norepinephrine circuits, it holds control over memory and context, etc. Therefore, not only is the part buzzing with activity but it also directly and indirectly affects a lot of processes.

""Everything in the research data now point to the idea that the anterior mid singulate cortex is the seat of so-called will power, which is linked to concepts like tenacity or grit.""

Something that Dr. Huberman highlighted in his talk was the plasticity of the brain part. This phenomenon meant that it could both be improved or reversed, depending on the situation. Since the anterior mid-singulate cortex showcases plasticity, it was modifiable by experience.

""It seems that when we don't engage in challenges...it doesn't atrophy but it undergoes sort of a downshift in activation.""

This situation means that if an individual performs activities that aren't particularly challenging, it leads to the slowing down of that brain part. While it doesn't cause the degeneration of the anterior mid-singulate cortex, it negatively affects it.

Elaborating on the experiment further in the talk, Dr. Huberman brought up the topic of 'super-agers'. These individuals scientifically age slowly compared to others due to their anterior mid-singulate cortex being hyperactive. This phenomenon not only helps them mentally fight diseases like cancer but also adds another perspective to their condition.

Zulazrai, 36, who has been in the business for five years, said that the bamboo is sourced from Raub, Pahang, and to date he has met the demand of approximately 50 lemang vendors in Melaka, Negeri Sembilan as well as Muar, and Tangkak in Johor.

""Last year, we started selling it in the middle of Ramadan, but this year we started at the beginning. The demand is very high. We will stop taking orders about five days before Hari Raya Aidilfitri.

""So far there are orders for 37,000 bamboo stems. The highest order is for 10,000 stems. We also sell small quantities if needed,"" he told reporters at his business premises in Pokok Mangga here today.

A native of Melaka, Zulazrai said that the suppliers have delivered 20,000 stems so far, with the rest expected to be staggered into four deliveries starting this Monday.

He explained that the wholesale price is RM1.30 per stem for purchases of 1,000 stems or more, and RM1.50 per stem for smaller quantities.

Zulazrai, who is in the business to augment his income during Hari Raya, said he preferred bamboo sourced from Raub, Pahang, emphasising its superior quality, with consistent lengths ranging from 43 to 45 centimetres.

""I used to get supplies from Kelantan and Terengganu, but they were shorter, between 33 to 35 centimetres, which are lower in demand among lemang vendors,"" said Zulazrai, who also runs a sugarcane business and sells health products online.

Aiming for gross sales of between RM70,000 to RM80,000 this year, he highlighted the numerous risks inherent in the lemang bamboo business, particularly the adverse effects of hot weather, which can potentially damage the bamboo.

Given the prevailing hot weather conditions in Melaka, he explained that the bamboo needs to be watered at least five times a day to maintain moisture levels and prevent cracking or splitting.

Zulazrai explained that upon arrival, the bamboo is sorted and separated by length, diameter, and quality before being bundled for sale.

""Usually, over 600 out of every 10,000 stems we receive are damaged and broken. We cannot return or exchange them as they are bought wholesale,"" he said.

He also mentioned that he has a stock of 4,000 lerek leaves for sale at RM0.50 each, which are used in making lemang.",thesun.my,news,thesun.my,,-0.04313725490196074,448973225,12,https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x337/0c44/480d250/none/11808/RKRW/mk06-24032024-buluh-lemang_3983981_20240324184109.jpg,

The occasion, an Iftar program hosted by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, saw the participation of young Ethiopians from various countries, including those born in Arab nations, who are currently in Ethiopia for Ramadan.

According to Ethiopian News Agency, attendees of the program emphasized the importance of solidarity among Ethiopians and acknowledged the developmental strides Ethiopia has made. Participants shared their observations and experiences, highlighting the contrast between misconceptions spread through social media and the actual progress on the ground in Ethiopia. Abdela Ibrahim from Saudi Arabia noted the significance of the Iftar meeting in fostering connections among the diaspora youth, urging their involvement in Ethiopia's youth-centric development initiatives.

Hanan Awol, a participant who has resettled in Ethiopia from Saudi Arabia, pointed out that the nation's developmental efforts are designed with a future-oriented perspective, emphasizing the need for collaborative support. Similarly, Saladin Abdu from Canada and Faris Ali from Yemen remarked on the transformative changes in Ethiopia, encouraging diaspora members worldwide to witness these advancements firsthand.

The event also served as a platform for diaspora members like Hudeten Salih and Hanan Awol to discuss their efforts in promoting Ethiopia's cultural and developmental narrative in Arabic on social media.

TINDERET - The Tinderet National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) has allocated Sh55 million in bursaries to support students across various educational levels in the constituency. The announcement was made by the area Member of Parliament, Julius Melly, during a cheque distribution event at Got Ne Lel Girls Secondary School.

According to Kenya News Agency, the bursary funds are distributed with Sh33 million designated for day school students, Sh8.5 million for boarding school students, and the remainder divided between learners in colleges and universities, receiving Sh6.2 million and Sh4.9 million respectively. Notably, 70 bright and needy students have been identified to receive up to Sh. 53,000 each, covering their full educational expenses. Furthermore, through the Presidential Bursary Scheme, an additional 56 students will benefit from Sh679,000 in total.

MP Melly emphasized the government and the constituency's dedication to ensuring educational access for all children, highlighting the bursary as a measure to combat school dropout rates. He addressed the local school principals, urging them to utilize the funds judiciously and prioritize the welfare of the learners. The government's broader objective, as Melly stated, is to progress towards universal education, leveraging support from various sectors to prevent any child from missing out on schooling due to financial barriers.

The issue of school dropouts, particularly those transitioning to work in sugarcane plantations, was highlighted as a critical concern for the constituency. Melly called on local administrators to enhance surveillance and ensure children remain in school. Additionally, he advised school heads against expelling students for fee non-payment, instead suggesting engagement with parents to arrange payment plans.

Melly also touched on the broader implications of education on student well-being, linking school attendance to improved academic performance and mental health. The alarming rate of suicides among Early Childhood Education teachers in the area was noted, with a call for enhanced mental health support and counseling services within schools.",africanewswire.za.com,news,Africa News Wire,,0.3568627450980393,448972879,1,,

By his standards, this rare total solar eclipse the rest of us are besotted with is happening around the corner.

Dr. Cackett, distinguished chair of the physics and astronomy department at Wayne State University, watched the last total eclipse in 2017. Been there, at the top of a mountain in Idaho, and done that.

Come April 8, then, at 2:27 p.m. EDT or so, while we slack-jawed yokels are gazing upward through our protective glasses ...

""I'll be saying 'wow,' too,"" he says.

Cackett, 43, has been a little kid about the stars since he was a little kid. Heavens, yes, he'll tell you, this solar eclipse is a worthy and wonderful thing to watch, even if metro Detroit won't quite get the full effect.

As an astronomer, he says, ""it's super exciting to see such a rare event.""

As a realist, he also says, ""April is a pretty sucky month for it to happen.""

But don't be put off by those technical terms. Have faith that the 65% chance of clouds in Michigan means a 35% chance of clear skies. Revel in the sights and sounds.

An eclipse, as Cackett knows, is a time to ponder our place in the vast universe. To be dazzled by nature's wonders. To reaffirm our innate quest for knowledge.

And OK, for Sonic, to introduce a new drink.

The Michigan Science Center will throw an eclipse viewing party at the Ford House in Grosse Pointe, because of course. Sonic will start selling a Blackout Slush Float on Monday, complete with eclipse viewing glasses, because why not.

The eclipse will be the grandest occasion for commercial tie-ins since Presidents Day. Maybe even since the Super Bowl, and the eclipse doesn't have a mob of lawyers telling everyone you can't use its name.

Also like the Super Bowl, the eclipse will be one more thing the Detroit Lions get to watch along with the rest of us. (What, too soon?) And if you take simple precautions -- who'd be obtuse enough to stare directly at the sun? -- it should be spectacular.

""Cool things happen the whole time,"" Cackett says. ""It gets dark during the daytime, and you see nature react. You hear the difference in the birds. It starts to get cooler.""

At totality, when the moon directly obscures the sun, ""you see stars in the daytime sky. You see the corona light up. The shadows start to go fuzzy and have weird shapes. It's just fun, whether you're a scientist or a regular person.""

He'll watch from Horseshoe Bay, Texas, northwest of Austin, at a conference of the high energy astrophysics division of the American Astronomical Society.

The high energy astrophysicists are no dummies. They tweaked their schedule to coincide with the eclipse, and picked a location that's one of the least likely spots on the path of totality to be overcast.

It was either that, or wait until 2044 for the next full eclipse in the continental U.S. Or 2099, if they want to see one from Detroit.

Cackett grew up outside Manchester, in the northwest of England, and learned to appreciate the cosmos on Boy Scouts camping trips.

The adults would talk about the stars, how some are red and some are blue, and he'd wonder, ""Why is that?""

As humans, he notes, we are naturally intrigued, trying to make sense of what we know and identify what we don't.

Why do we exist? Why do stars seem to twinkle? Why do we drive on a parkway, but park in a driveway?

Curiosity crosses boundaries. Answers lead to more questions. Sometimes there are practical applications; helium was first detected during a solar eclipse in 1868, and now we have party balloons. Sometimes knowledge is its own reward.

Cackett's work focuses on trying to understand how material falls into supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.

For that, he sometimes employs WSU's computer-operated Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory in remote Rodeo, New Mexico, donated by an astronomer turned businessman in honor of a high school friend who had shared his passion for the night sky.

The powerful telescope there won't be of use during the eclipse. It's outside the path of totality, Cackett explains, and not being equipped with a special filter, ""if we point it at the sun, we'll fry everything.""

But it has helped him see how the brightness of light changes over time, which, in turn, might tell what occurs as things tumble into the oblivion of a black hole, which might ultimately help starships navigate distant galaxies.

The black holes are millions of light years from Earth. They are, Cackett says, 1 million to 1 billion times the size of the sun.

Poland said the missile was part of a Russian bombardment of targets in Ukraine as Moscow steps up its attacks on its western neighbour.

Following a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine by Russia, Poland activated ""all air defence systems, all air force systems"", the country's defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

He said that the missile would have been shot down ""had there been any indication it was heading for a target on Polish territory"".

The army said the missile, which was travelling at almost 800kph around 400m above the ground, had crossed about 2km over the border into Poland.

""Polish airspace was breached by one of the cruise missiles fired in the night by the air forces... of the Russian Federation,"" the army wrote on X.

""The object flew through Polish airspace above the village of Oserdow (Lublin province) and stayed for 39 seconds,"" the statement said, adding that it was tracked by military radar throughout its flight.

""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on permanent alert to ensure the security of Polish airspace,"" the army said.

In November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, close to the Ukrainian border.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Sonam Wangchuk, lying under blankets, is surrounded by supporters on the 17th day of his hunger strike seeking protected status for the region's people, land and ecology in Leh, India, Friday, March 22, 2024. - AP

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Wangchuk recently posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh & continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned."" - AP",thestar.com.my,news,The Star ,,-0.2627450980392156,448972613,1,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/03/24/2609051.jpg,eng-9419920

Try this eye test to avoid fake ones,"The world is looking forward to witness this year's first total solar eclipse on April 8 but according to reports, vendors have been selling fake eclipse glasses.

According to experts, while getting ready for this year's eclipse, people must make sure to take good care of their eyes and stay alert for fake eclipse glasses being sold across the US.

To fully experience the solar eclipse, it is necessary to stare directly at the sun which can be detrimental to eye health.

However, solar eclipse glasses have been designed to block out the most harmful parts of the solar spectrum for the sake of human eye health.

Fake eclipse glasses don't do anything to protect your eyes from the sun. So, if you're viewing the eclipse in any capacity this year, try this eyeglasses test to make sure that your eyes are really being protected.

If your pair of eclipse glasses appears dark, that's a good starting point as they should only allow you to see the sun or a brighter object through them.

Try testing the glasses on something as bright as the sun which, according to the American Astronomical Society (AAS) can be done with the help of a mirror or a shiny metal object.

The AAS recommends using sunlight reflected off a mirror to test the glasses, while bright-white LEDs like phone flashlight or a bare lightbulbs can be used when the sun is behind clouds.

A safe pair of eclipse glasses should appear dimly reflecting sunlight or bright artificial light. If you can see light behind a lamp shade or soft bulb through the glasses, they aren't strong enough to safely stare at the sun.

The AAS states that safe solar eclipse glasses should make the sun appear comfortably bright, similar to the full moon, and if they are uncomfortable, it suggests the glasses may not be legitimate.",geo.tv,news,GEO TV,,0.3254901960784313,448972593,1,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-03-24/l_536264_032429_updates.jpg,eng-9413446

On April 8, the moon will pass between Earth and the sun, briefly blocking the sun's light from parts of North America in a total solar eclipse. The shadow cast by this rare cosmic event will render regions on the moon's ""path of totality"" as dark as they would be at night.

For viewers in and around the United States, that path will enter the country from Mexico, passing through Texas then arcing north and east to Canada's coast. The last total solar eclipse that could be seen from the contiguous United States was in 2017, but the next one won't arrive until Aug. 23, 2044.

In anticipation of next month's solar excitement, Wonderwall.com is taking a look back at some of the most amazing eclipse photos we've seen through the years, starting with this one ...

On May 20, 2012, the moon moved into a partial eclipse position after reaching annularity, the maximum phase of an annular eclipse. In this photo provided by NASA, sun spots can be seen as the moon partially eclipses the sun.

Unlike a total solar eclipse, the moon in an annular eclipse appears too small to cover the sun completely, leaving a ring of fire effect around the moon.

How do you believe women's voices and contributions can be pivotal in shaping a more inclusive and equitable society, particularly in male-dominated industries like tech?

As a woman who has navigated through the male-dominated energy industry, I firmly believe that women's voices and contributions are not just pivotal but essential in shaping a more inclusive and equitable society, especially in fields like tech. Diversity in perspectives leads to innovation, and when women are empowered to bring their unique insights and skills to the table, we not only enhance the quality of decision-making but also create more sustainable and impactful solutions. By fostering an environment where women are encouraged to participate and lead, we can break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and pave the way for a future where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive.

As we commemorate Women's Month, could you share a personal experience or story highlighting the impact of women's leadership and innovation in your field and how it has contributed to positive change?

I always say that being an entrepreneur is hard, but being a female entrepreneur adds an additional layer of difficulty. This is even more so in male-dominated industries like the energy industry. According to a recent study by Ernst & Young, only 5% of the executives in the global energy industry are women. This fact speaks for itself.

When I co-founded Eco Wave Power, I was 24 years old. When I entered a conference room, all excited to present EWP's pioneering wave energy technology, the men in the meeting often asked me for coffee, as they were sure I was someone's assistant.

Today, Eco Wave Power is a leading onshore wave energy company publicly traded on Nasdaq US under the symbol WAVE. We have become the first company in Israel to connect wave energy to the national electrical grid. We will soon commence installation of our first wave energy array in the United States, in the port of Los Angeles. Eco Wave Power has secured licensing for the first 1 MW to construct a commercial-scale wave power station in Portos, Portugal. In addition, the company holds more than 400 MW in its project pipeline.

As we celebrate Women's Month, I'm reminded of the countless women who continue to defy expectations, break barriers, and drive innovation in their respective fields. Their contributions inspire me personally and serve as a testament to women's limitless potential in creating a better, more equitable world.

The aftermath of tragic events like October 7 often calls for introspection and action. How can we leverage technology and innovation at this time? And what role can women leaders play in driving this change?

The tragedy that transpired on October 7 was unprecedented. Our hearts are broken. During these hard times, it is crucial for us to take action. Innovation in Israel isn't just a product of individual ambition - it's a collective journey fueled by a synergy of diverse talents and perspectives. Here, collaboration knows no boundary, as entrepreneurs, scientists, and visionaries come together to tackle the world's most pressing challenges.

The role of women leaders in fighting these challenges cannot be overstated. Women bring unique perspectives and problem-solving approaches to the table, which are essential in developing holistic solutions to complex challenges. By advocating for inclusive and ethical tech solutions, promoting diversity in STEM fields, and fostering collaboration across sectors, women leaders can play a pivotal role in building more resilient and sustainable communities in the face of adversity.

Women continue to face barriers and biases in the workplace. What strategies or initiatives have you found effective in breaking through these barriers, and what advice would you give to other women aspiring to leadership roles in your industry?

I established Eco Wave Power when I was only 24. While stepping into this industry with no access to funds and no network was scary, my message is that passion always prevails. Even in the most challenging times, when I was not taken seriously as a young woman, I kept going and did not give up.

In terms of advice for other women aspiring to leadership roles in my industry, I would emphasize the importance of resilience and persistence. There will inevitably be setbacks and obstacles, but don't let them stop you from pursuing your goals. Instead, view them as learning experiences and opportunities for growth. Surround yourself with a supportive network of peers and mentors who have faith in your capabilities and can offer guidance and encouragement.

As we strive for progress and empowerment, collaboration and solidarity are crucial. How do you envision fostering a supportive environment that uplifts and amplifies women's voices within your industry and beyond?

As the CEO and founder of EWP, I lead a strategy of inclusion and equality in every subsidiary of Eco Wave Power. I strive to create critical roles for women in this innovative industry. In addition, I invest significant efforts and resources to foster a more gender-diverse workplace. The company seeks out suitable female employees to ensure that women have a seat at the table in decision-making.

Furthermore, I mentor several female interns each year from leading universities worldwide and assist them with developing the skills and tools necessary to succeed as future female entrepreneurs. Equal representation for women is crucial for innovation in the energy field and for creating a more sustainable and prosperous planet.

I believe that I am a strong role model who can inspire other women to become innovators because I established Eco Wave Power at a very young age without contacts in the energy field or access to funding. I have always said that passion is the greatest renewable energy source.

Nowadays, I make significant efforts to inspire future female entrepreneurs by giving inspirational speeches about female entrepreneurship, sharing my personal experiences, and stressing the need not to give up, even if you are the only woman in the room.

Gaming platform Roblox (RBLX -1.14%) has been an incredible growth story in recent years. There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

Metaverse technology is still in its relative infancy. The global metaverse industry is just starting to gain serious traction. According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Matt Frankel,0.4039215686274509,448972371,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770051/gaming-2022.jpg,

Frederick Douglass understood the power of photography.

He was the most photographed man in the United States in the 1800s -- yes, even more than Abraham Lincoln -- and he believed that crafting a striking public image for himself could help move the abolitionist movement forward.

That power, along with Douglass' legacy, is brought into focus through two exhibits at Skidmore College's Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery.

The first, titled ""Studio/Archive"" on the ground floor, offers a feast of photography from the museum's impressive collection, including daguerreotypes, a form of portraiture with which Douglass was well familiar.

It was one of the earliest forms of photography, invented in 1837, and it helped make portraiture more accessible to the masses. There are just over a dozen on display at the Tang and each pocket-sized portrait is set in an ornate case. None of the subjects is identified, though each piece is distinctive. Some figures look hauntingly at the viewer, while others gaze just off to the side as if talking to the artist.

The daguerreotypes are a good segue into the rest of the show, which in part focuses on how artists use photography to shape their images and capture the spirit of their communities. Alice O'Malley's striking work, which hangs nearby, does this most directly. Called ""Community of Elsewhere,"" the black-and-white series spotlights artists and performers in O'Malley's circle, particularly the Lower East Side of New York City.

The poses are powerful and largely directed by the subjects themselves rather than the artist. In one, a figure sits tall on a high chair wearing only a corset, spotlighting tattoos on their arm and chest.

Elsewhere, artist Huang Yan juxtaposes the history of China with its future, putting children in front of the lens. In a triptych, a brother and sister are shown with faces painted in traditional shan shui ink brush style, with a white background ornamented with flowers and other natural imagery. It's set against their modern school uniforms and accessories, including the soccer-ball-laden hair ties worn by the sister.

The ""Archive"" portion of the show delves into images we hold onto and questions why that might be. One standout work revisits the famous Dorothea Lange photograph ""Migrant Mother,"" which illustrated the hunger and desperation felt by people across the country during the Great Depression. Artist Vik Muniz, a Brazilian immigrant to the United States, offers a refreshing take on the image and recreates the portrait using thick dots of ink, the style reminiscent of comic books and newspapers. His version brings the image of the mother further into focus, blurring out the two children almost entirely.

A similar dot-matrix style is echoed in a brooding landscape nearby. Capturing the visage of Saint Malo, artist Elger Esser took a postcard of the city, photographed it and enlarged it. The piece plays with the idea of a souvenir, questioning what we can take with us.

Filling another gallery wall are hundreds of identically sized photographs, grouped by theme. The artist, Joachim Schmid, collected the images from flea markets and magazines, and incorporated his photography into the series. Each grouping can be read as an archive of the theme (sunsets, German Shepherds, etc.) and a commentary on the way we frame our world.

That theme plays out across 10 screens, hung salon-style, upstairs. The film installation, titled ""Lessons of the Hour,"" was created by London-based artist Isaac Julien. It features Douglass, portrayed by Ray Fearon, delivering snippets of speeches on the importance of photography for furthering the abolitionist cause. Douglass is also seen with powerful women and activists of the time, including Susan B. Anthony and Ottilie Assing.

The film is captivating, with vibrant, saturated colors and an aesthetic that weaves together the historical and contemporary. In some shots Douglass is in the studio, curating his image, while in others he's speaking to crowds of people drawn to him in part because of that arresting image.

""Lessons of the Hour"" will be on view through May 19. ""Studio/Archive"" will be up for a bit longer, running through June 9. The museum is open Tuesdays through Sundays.

The President of Pakistan conferred that award on her on the Pakistan Day in recognition of her ""outstanding contribution"" towards strengthening Pakistan-U.S. relations.

""The efforts by Ms. Power are a reflection of her commitment to assist the people of Pakistan and forge a strong and deep partnership between Pakistan and the US,"" stated the citation that was read out the occasion.

Ms. Power, who has been serving as USAID chief since May 2021, is a proponent of strong Pakistan-US cooperation in humanitarian and socio-economic sectors like health, education and climate change and promoting people to people exchanges.

""As USAID administrator, she was instrumental in the provision of significant life-saving US humanitarian assistance to mitigate the disastrous impacts of the floods in 2022,"" the citation said.

In a video message, she also recalled the devastation when one-third of Pakistan was inundated due to devastating floods in 2022.

""I will never forget visiting Pakistan in September of 2022. Flying over the floods, feeling sure that I was flying over an ocean, only to be reminded that the ocean was in fact hundreds of miles away.

Or maybe super progressives, given how much they want to reshape politics in Los Angeles.

Whatever the label, candidates on the left end of the political spectrum made crucial advances in the March 5 primary election for City Council, setting the stage for some hard-fought runoff campaigns and potentially, an expansion of their power by the end of the year.

Progressive activists and advocacy groups helped reelect City Councilmember Nithya Raman, while sending two other left-of-center candidates -- tenant rights attorney Ysabel Jurado and small business owner Jillian Burgos -- into runoffs against more moderate rivals.

""I think the results showed consistently across the board that when we show up, we win,"" said Bill Przylucki, executive director of Ground Game LA, a nonprofit advocacy group that has spent several years pushing the council to the left.

If Burgos and Jurado prevail in November, the number of council members with deeply progressive backgrounds will grow from three to five, making up a third of the 15-member council. Four of the five have campaigned alongside Democratic Socialists of America-Los Angeles. Burgos, the fifth, drew support from other big names in leftist political circles, including City Controller Kenneth Mejia and former mayoral candidate Gina Viola.

A five-member super-progressive voting bloc would have significant influence over homelessness, subsidized housing, tenant protections, public transit, the installation of bike lanes and the size of the Los Angeles Police Department.

The bloc would need only three more votes to pass legislation on a council where several members, including Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Katy Yaroslavsky, are left-of-center swing votes. Super progressives also would occupy additional seats on the council's committees, allowing them to shape policies from their inception, Przylucki said.

Some players in L.A. politics say the effect of the left in the primary is overstated. They point out that Councilmember John Lee, one of the council's centrist members, easily won his reelection bid in the northwest Valley. Another incumbent, Councilmember Imelda Padilla, coasted to reelection after securing support from public safety unions, construction trade unions, Valley business groups and others.

Raman won 50.7% of the vote, securing the majority she needed to win outright. But that victory simply preserved the existing political makeup of the council, said Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which waged an expensive but unsuccessful campaign against Raman.

""At the end of the day, there's been no net gain for any ideology on the council,"" he said. ""There's still three socialists on the council. That was before the election, that was after the election.""

Saggau said the police union has not yet decided how it will spend its resources in the upcoming runoffs.

L.A.'s progressive groups remain hopeful that Jurado and Burgos will win and shift the status quo.

Julio Marcial, senior vice president of the nonprofit Liberty Hill Foundation, said that expanding the council's super-progressive bloc would ensure that City Hall has a ""real, honest conversation"" about strategies for community safety. For Marcial, that means shifting money out of the LAPD and into affordable housing, expanded mental health services, job training and other programs.

""We can no longer follow the same playbook around budgeting, where we fully fund law enforcement and not the things that are proven to be effective in creating community safety,"" he said.

Burgos, who is running to represent an east San Fernando Valley district, said she's hoping that if she and Jurado win, other council members will be inclined to embrace more progressive policies.

""Right now, some people are afraid to make those choices,"" said Burgos, an optician who lives in North Hollywood and part owner of an interactive murder mystery theater company.

Burgos, 45, and Jurado, 34, have a long list of shared policy goals. Both want to repeal Municipal Code 41.18, which prohibits homeless encampments next to schools, daycare centers and ""sensitive"" locations such as senior centers and freeway overpasses. Both want to create ""social housing,"" assigning city agencies to buy, fix and manage low-cost apartment complexes.

The two candidates want to shift traffic enforcement out of the LAPD. And they're hoping to make bus and train fares free -- a more complicated goal, since the decision rests not with the council but Metro's 13-member board.

""We have a real opportunity to usher in a progressive era"" at the City Council, ""instead of just chipping away at some the solutions that we care about,"" said Jurado, who finished first in an eight-way race for the Eastside seat now held by Councilmember Kevin de León.

Burgos, who describes herself as a leftist, finished second in the race to replace Council President Paul Krekorian, who is stepping down at the end of the year. In first place is former State Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, a onetime Krekorian aide who describes himself as a ""pragmatic progressive.""

Nazarian secured 37% of the vote in the primary, compared with 22% for Burgos. In an interview, he said that he, too, has pushed for progressive policies, such as expanded public transit, increased funding to help students pay for college and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. In 2016 and again in 2020, Nazarian endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president in the Democratic primary.

""Judge me by my record. Judge me by my work ethic. There's a reason why, in a crowded field of seven people, that I was able to garner almost 40% of the vote,"" he said.

Nazarian, unlike Burgos, supports the continued use of 41.18. He also spoke in favor of Mayor Karen Bass' push to hire more police and raise their pay.

Burgos, asked about those two issues, called for more alternatives to police, saying in a statement that ""data has shown that there is no correlation between the number of sworn officers or the police budget and crime.""

De León, who came in second behind Jurado, also defended his progressive credentials, pointing to his work on immigrant rights, climate change and laws to prevent the displacement of renters in downtown, Boyle Heights and elsewhere.

""My record of taking on the toughest fights -- Sanctuary State, 100% clean renewable energy, tenant protections -- and winning for my constituents shows I know how to actually accomplish progressive change,"" said De León, a former president of the state Senate who is seeking a second term.

De León faces a tough second round. He is still dealing with the fallout from a scandal over his participation in a secretly recorded conversation that featured racist and derogatory remarks.

Like Nazarian, he supports the LAPD raises, the hiring of more police and the use of 41.18.

L.A.'s leftists made their first serious inroads at City Hall four years ago, helping to elect Raman, a member of Democratic Socialists of America, to the council. Labor unions and advocacy groups replicated that success in 2022, working to elect two more Democratic Socialists of America-backed candidates -- activist Eunisses Hernandez and labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martínez -- and ousting two incumbents.

Of the three, Raman has proved to be the most moderate. Like Nazarian, she sometimes refers to herself as a ""pragmatic progressive."" At one point in the primary campaign, she declined to say whether the city needs more police officers. At another, she relied on former Councilmember Paul Koretz -- who has drawn the ire of L.A.'s leftists -- to vouch for her with the Los Angeles County Democratic Party.

Attorney Edgar Khalatian, who represents real estate developers at City Hall, said he considers Raman to be pro-business. Raman, whose district straddles the Hollywood Hills, has shown ""a strong backbone"" on the city's efforts to build more housing, while also working to address the homelessness crisis, he said.

""The reason housing prices are as astronomical as they are is decades of elected officials not supporting the development of more housing,"" said Khalatian, who chairs the board of the Central City Assn., a downtown-based business group. ""She supports housing, and will take the political heat from people in her district when she supports that housing.""

Raman won despite more than $1.3 million in outside spending by the firefighters union, the police officers union, landlords and others for one of her opponents, Deputy City Atty. Ethan Weaver. Those groups waged a similar effort in the northwest Valley, spending a combined $1.1 million to help Lee turn back a challenge from nonprofit leader Serena Oberstein.

In South L.A.'s 10th Council District, law enforcement groups spent a combined $103,000 on ads portraying Reggie Jones-Sawyer, one of the five candidates, as soft on crime. Jones-Sawyer, a state assemblymember, came in fifth.

""For the rank-and-file of the league, we had a few goals"" in this year's city election, said Saggau, the police union spokesperson. ""One of them was to ensure that Reggie Jones-Sawyer did not bring his brand of criminal justice reform, or ideas, to the city of L.A., and we succeeded on that.""

The 10th District will instead see a runoff between Councilmember Heather Hutt and attorney Grace Yoo, who share the same views on some of the city's more contentious issues. Both support the city's package of police raises and 41.18.

A spokesperson for the Democratic Socialists of America's Los Angeles chapter said it's unlikely her organization will get involved in that contest, in part because neither candidate is a DSA member. Given that they both favor the police raises, it would be ""remarkably difficult"" for either to win the DSA's endorsement, said the spokesperson, who declined to give her full name.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1215686274509804,448972025,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/629fcbc2972f41c7685dd6f04041c7ab,

Will politics and power worries doom it?","There is a political tug of war taking place over development of a data center in southeast Connecticut, a project that would put the state in the race to satisfy the voracious appetite of artificial intelligence for computational power while delivering $1 billion or more in payments to state and local governments.

What is dividing Gov. Ned Lamont's commissioners and some in the legislature are questions arising from what promoters believe is a groundbreaking arrangement that makes a power-hungry, mega data center economically feasible in a state and region with some of the nation's highest electric rates.

To power and cool tens of thousands of computer servers, the developers have arranged to plug directly into two nuclear-powered generators operated by Dominion Energy on Millstone Point in Waterford. Skeptics worry that the data center's power consumption -- as much as 13% of the Millstone output -- could raise consumer electric rates or, worse, affect the reliability of the regional electricity supply.

Thomas Quinn, president of NE Edge, the data center developer, calls the concern unwarranted. He has forecasts created by the operator of the New England electric grid that he says show there will be more than enough generated electricity flowing into the network in coming years to support the center. And he said the tens of millions of dollars he has agreed to deliver to the state annually over the next 30 years could actually lower electric rates.

But not everyone is persuaded.

The Lamont administration is split. Economic and Community Development Commissioner Dan O'Keefe is an enthusiastic supporter, along with the town of Waterford, Dominion Energy and an array of business and labor groups. Katie Dykes, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, is said by others involved in the project to oppose it and supports a bill in the legislature calling for a study that could delay it.

Quinn says a delay might doom the project by shifting momentum elsewhere in the race to build what would amount to New England's first clean energy, hyper-scale data center.

Lamont appears to be keeping both options open, a spokesman said.

""Data centers are the backbone of the digital age, and Governor Lamont believes that Connecticut is a prime location for this industry to build this infrastructure and create the corresponding jobs that support their operations,"" spokesman David Bednarz said. ""As the governor noted in his State of the State address last month, modern technology is putting more demands upon the grid, and he welcomes the insight of legislators on the energy and environment committees regarding methods of sourcing the next generation of clean energy with an emphasis upon affordability.""

There is agreement on at least one point: In the age of artificial intelligence, powering the computational capacity to run devices like self-driving cars won't be cheap, particularly in states turning away from traditional energy sources and struggling to develop expensive renewables like offshore wind. One industry group estimates AI could consume 8% of U.S. energy output by 2030.

Quinn says NE Edge wants to build on a scale that would separate it from typical data centers -- there are more than two dozen across Connecticut and Massachusetts -- and the success of his plan turns on the cost of electricity.

""This isn't a data center,"" Quinn said. ""This is a high performance compute AI base. That is what they call it. The difference in what we are doing from a normal data center is the difference between a single family house and a skyscraper.""

What distinguishes NE Edge is not just that it would be powered by a nuclear generation plant, but that it will have an agreement with plant operator Dominion that will allow the center to tie directly to the Millstone generators without passing through the costly transmission infrastructure controlled by Eversource and regulated by the state.

By remaining ""behind the meter,"" as Quinn puts it, NE Edge can negotiate a power purchase agreement with Dominion that is lower than the rate -- one of the highest in the nation -- that Connecticut utility customers pay. Without a negotiated ""behind the meter"" agreement, Quinn said a project of the scale he envisions would not be practical in New England.

It also makes for an environmentally friendly, ""clean"" operation by avoiding the use of carbon-based electric generation..

NE Edge would make money by connecting to the high speed fiber optic network that runs past the Millstone site and renting computing services to businesses, from online retailers to stock exchanges.

NE Edge has pushed its proposal for five years. It got a break in 2021 with enactment of a state law that waived sales and property taxes for up to 30 years for developers who invest $400 million in data center projects. The law, the product of an unsuccessful Connecticut attempt to attract data center development that could lure the processing of Wall Street trades away from New York and New Jersey, also cleared the way for behind the meter connections to electricity generators.

Quinn said NE Edge has secured $1.6 billion in financing for construction of buildings, an electric switching station and two, two-story buildings with a combined 1.2 million square feet. He plans to spend an equivalent amount on 25,000 to 35,000 servers and enough recyclable sodium ion batteries to ensure the power supply is never interrupted.

The data center would occupy 55 acres of Dominion's 526 acre Millstone property and would not be visible from roads to the north or from Long Island Sound to the south, according to a report by the Connecticut Siting Council. Quinn said Turner Construction, currently building 17 clean data centers in the U.S., is to be the builder.

To keep the center quiet -- Quinn said the center's noise level should match the area's ambient level -- loud equipment like air handlers would be placed inside the buildings and enclosed by insulated concrete walls so thick they must be poured while lying flat on the ground and later tilted up into place.

Under a host fee provision in the state law establishing the tax incentive, NE Edge would pay Waterford $231 million over the next 30 years in lieu of property taxes.

The state would get more than $1 billion over 30 years, Quinn said.

Part of the state's money would come from a premium NE Edge agrees to pay based on 12.08% of what it pays Dominion for electricity. Quinn said the premium could amount to $1.1 billion or about a third of what the state owes on a long-term power purchase agreement it has with Dominion. The state signed its agreement with Dominion as an incentive for the company to keep the Millstone reactors in operation, according to the Connecticut Siting Council.

Quinn said NE Edge has agreed to pay the state another $63 million over 30 years through contributions to an energy assistance fund that supports residents who cannot pay electricity bills.

Finally, NE Edge has agreed to store the state's data at a rate discounted by 27.5%, Quinn said, a deal that would make Connecticut the first state to store its data in a fossil free operation.

Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said NE Edge's Waterford plan is being watched closely by industry players across the Northeast.

""I really am hard pressed to think of another example in New England where we could see a data center come in at that scale with land use, population density and then, honestly, the retail price of electricity that is relatively high across New England compared to the rest of the country,"" he said. ""So I think this is a unique one.""

Dominion Energy said in a statement that it supports the project and recognizes ""the benefits of constructing a large electric user near a generating plant."" The company is applying for license renewals that could keep the Millstone reactors active into the 2060s, and said that power purchase agreements like that contemplated with NE Edge are ""critical to Dominion Energy's continued operations.""

The company said it is ""in discussions with NE Edge regarding a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) but there is not a signed PPA.""

Waterford First Selectman Rob Brule said his board and the 28-member Representative Town Meeting both voted unanimously in support of the data center ""to help retain our largest taxpayer, Dominion Energy, and provide additional decades of financial stability in the Town's tax base.""

Questions about the NE Edge plan are coming from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Dominion said it has ""had high level conversations with DEEP about the data center project,"" but did not elaborate. A DEEP spokesman said Commissioner Dykes would not discuss the project beyond her brief remarks when she appeared recently before the legislature's Energy and Technology Committee to comment on legislation that would order a study of data center electric power use.

""We recognize that artificial intelligence is providing enormous promise and there are a lot of questions about it,"" Dykes told the committee. ""But from the energy perspective alone I understand that the demand and need for data centers is expanding significantly ...

""And so we think that it is really important to have the right framework to ensure that there is equitable deployment of this kind of demand, that it doesn't shift any costs or increase costs to other ratepayers and is harmonized with the need to maintain reliability of the grid. So we welcome the opportunity to further engage with the committee as it decides on ways to support the expansion of data centers, but in a way that accomplishes those goals.""

Dykes was testifying on a brief and hastily drawn committee bill that, if enacted, would require a variety of regulatory agencies, including DEEP, the state's rate setting authority and the independent operator of the New England energy grid, to ""evaluate the impact of large data centers on grid reliability.""

Sen. Norm Needleman, the committee chairman who had staff draft the bill, said he is focused on a part of the NE Edge plan that would have the data center draw power from the regional power grid on occasions when Millstone generation is offline because of maintenance or other issues.

""That is like a double whammy on the power plan,"" Needleman said. ""You've got a 300 megawatts reduction at Millstone. And at the same time if something happened and backup needed to be run, you are pulling 300 megawatts off of the grid.""

Millstone is a major contributor to the regional electric grid, supplying 12% of the region's peak energy load between 2019 and 2022, according to a report by the Connecticut Siting Council. The same report says that Dominion believes that providing power to the data center would not affect its commitment to supply the grid.

Dominion ""believes the interconnection of the data centers and associated switchyard would not have any impact on Millstone Power Station's winter and summer reliability,"" the report said.

As written, there is nothing in the committee bill that could block the data center. But Needleman called the bill a work in progress and said there is the possibility of a revision that could make the tax exemptions on which the project depends contingent on completion of an energy study. Other legislative observers said there is no guarantee the bill has enough support to survive in any form.

The siting council also has questions about the center's power use, questions similar to those asked by Dykes. Its jurisdiction over the location of electrical generating facilities gives it authority to decide whether to grant a request by Dominion to sell a portion of its property on Millstone Point to NE Edge.

The council denied Dominion's request to sell the land in early January. In a written decision, the siting council concluded that ""it is premature"" to examine terms of the land sale because of a ""lack of information"" about the data centers and their direct connection to Millstone.

Dominion can resubmit the request after providing more information to the council. But three months after the denial, the council has not said what information it wants, a NE Edge official said.

The siting council's executive director did not respond to a request to discuss the decision.

Quinn said a report published earlier this month by ISO New England, the independent operator of the New England electric grid, backs his contention that there is enough electric generation in the region to support the data center without affecting other customers.

""This March 1st, 2024, ISO-NE report fully addresses the Energy and Technology Committee's questions offered at the recent public hearing,"" he said.

ISO New England is aware of the Waterford data center but has not evaluated the proposal.

""We would need more specific information to evaluate that concept,"" ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said. ""If a specific proposal does come to the ISO, we would evaluate it at that time.

""Adding a data center in New England is not necessarily a problem. Businesses and industry regularly develop new ventures in the region and the ISO continually evaluates the transmission system and supply needed to meet the changing demand. The demand for electricity is expected to grow substantially as the states seek to decarbonize transportation and buildings through electrification, nearly doubling by 2050.""",courant.com,news,Hartfort Courant,Edmund H.

The lights are brighter in downtown Honolulu where post-­pandemic changes to work and lifestyle patterns are fueling an investment cycle that is expected to deliver at least 15 new projects valued at about $1 billion over the next five to seven years.

During the pandemic, low interest rates and the quest for wide-open spaces drove many Oahu homebuyers into the suburbs, especially as employers began offering remote and hybrid work options. Vacancy rates rose in office buildings in Honolulu's prime central business district.

The change has drawn investors who hope to convert excess office space into residential rentals and fee-simple housing, hotels, educational space, retail, activity centers, food and beverage venues, and community services like dog parks and senior care.

The result is expected to yield a more balanced market that improves safety and allows downtown Honolulu to thrive outside of the traditional 7 a.m.-to-4 p.m. work window.

Christine Camp, president and CEO of Avalon Development Co., provided the $1 billion estimate to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser last week.

""Avalon isn't the first. We're just the latest and we won't be the last,"" Camp said.""There's a huge wave of investment that will bring fundamental changes. When you have that many people in a six-block radius thinking about the same things it will happen.""

Camp's remarks followed the blessing of Modea, the company's reuse project that will turn part of the 22-story Davies Pacific Center into a fee-simple condominium with 352 units. New life is also planned for the former Fort Street Walmart, which Avalon acquired this month for $38 million.

Camp said Avalon's recent purchases of at least three city blocks puts the company among the major stakeholders committed to the downtown revitalization.

Other stakeholders in the revitalization include: Douglas Emmett, Continental Assets Management, 'Ikenakea, Rick Cho, Colbert Matsumoto, Hemick, Central Pacific Bank, Hawaii State Federal Credit Union, Hawaiian Host and Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Hawai'i Pacific University, the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and Catholic Charities Hawaii's Housing Development Corp., and WKF Inc., lead by Duane and Robert Kurisu.

Camp said WKF has been moving businesses displaced from the Keeaumoku district into downtown, such as Evergreen Adult Day Care, which is going into the Hansmann Building, as well as supporting new growth across the downtown blocks that they own.

Mark Bratton, senior vice president for Colliers International, agreed with Camp's estimate and said that together, these stakeholders are making a difference by reviving a conversion trend that started in Honolulu and cities across America before the pandemic.

""When you look back at 2018 and 2019 in downtown, the health of the businesses, the retail and art community and Chinatown, things were thriving,"" he said. ""The pandemic dealt it a huge blow like a lot of downtowns around the country, most notably San Francisco.

""Lucky for us we have these handful of local leaders willing to stand up and invest and take on risk to reinvigorate downtown. It's taken several years to reset from the pandemic, and the only way out of it is to reinvest and make it a thriving 24-hour marketplace.""

Camp said there were already signs that downtown was ripe for change before Avalon bought the Davies Pacific Center.

She said in 2021, Hemic converted the American Savings Bank Building, which the bank had vacated in 2018, into office space for over 100 employees. She said Central Pacific Bank also completed a $40 million investment in its downtown headquarters in 2021.

Camp said the Hawaii State Federal Credit Union opened in June 2023 with 230 employees. There's also a new Hawaiian Host and Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts headquarters.

After the opening of The Residences at Bishop Place, a Douglas Emmett residential rental conversion at 1132 Bishop St., Camp said she knew there was enough demand for Modea if people were willing to pay $2,375 monthly rent for a studio and $3,725 for a two-bedroom with extra fees for parking and pets.

Modea, at 1698 Queen St., is aimed at Hawaii's middle-income singles, families with small kids, and what Camp refers to as ""sinkwads and dinkwads,"" which translates into single or double incomes, no kids with a dog.

F. Kevin Aucello, principal and co-founder of Powell & Aucello, said the new residential and food and beverage development combined with downtown's proximity to businesses and government buildings also has fueled a hotel investment cycle. He said 'Ikenakea's Chris Flaherty is developing a 15-story, 240-unit hotel at 112 N. Nimitz Highway. Aucello said the hotel, which is near a future Skyline station and overlooks Honolulu Harbor, is likely to be branded a Hyatt.

Aucello said another possibility is the conversion of the three-story Wo Fat Building at 115 Hotel St. A partnership team, including Donald Kenney, former University of Hawaii football coach June Jones, Dickie Chang and John Davenport, have announced their intention to build a 100-seat ground-floor restaurant topped with 23 luxury hotel rooms.

""I think we'll see at least a couple more downtown hotels in addition to what's already opened. Interest will depend on how many get completed,"" Aucello said.

He said the planned hotels would join the longtime Aston at the Executive Centre Hotel and the newly opened AC Hotel by Marriott Honolulu, which ""has been a smashing success.""

Pandemic recovery

Patricia Chang Moad, vice president of operations for Continental Assets Management, a private real estate investment company founded by her father, Andy Chang, was an early pioneer to the current downtown development cycle. The company developed the recently opened 112-room AC Hotel by Marriott Honolulu at 1111 Bishop St. in the old Remington College office building.

""COVID hit two months into escrow. We were shell-shocked,"" Moad said. ""It was a ghost town and there was a point where we had to decide whether to move forward. But I've been a professional in downtown Honolulu for 15 years and my chosen playground has always been downtown and Chinatown, and we strongly believe in this community of hardworking business owners.""

Moad said Honolulu's pandemic recovery has been slow, but ultimately has paid off. The proof is in the robust occupancy rate since the Dec. 12 hotel opening as well as ""all the influx of business owners who believe in this market and are now investing a considerable amount of capital.""

""We are so excited to be at the forefront of this renaissance of downtown,"" she said. ""We're bullish on downtown and we are planning even more investment.""

Developers often succeed because they can read the tea leaves, finding that bit of future left after the cup is otherwise empty -- and there has been a lot of empty in downtown Honolulu.

Mike Hamasu, Colliers International research and consulting director, said Oahu's office vacancy rate, which had improved to 10% in 2019, rose above 13% in 2023, and was expected to continue climbing.

""But with all the office conversions that have started or are being planned, we are projecting maybe by 2025 there may be a reduction of about 1 million square feet of office space. Without that, a lot of it would have probably been vacant space, so a vacancy rate that might have skyrocketed to about 16% is hovering at about 14%,"" he said.

Jamie Brown, president and owner of brokerage firm Hawaii Commercial Real Estate LLC, said a reason that downtown Honolulu was hit hard by the pandemic was its office footprint, which historically ""has been about 50% of the office inventory of the entire island, and virtually the entire state.""

Brown, nicknamed ""Downtown Jamie Brown"" by colleagues, said the The Residences at Bishop Place offset the office market decline during the pandemic, and Modea saved the office market from its post-pandemic hangover.

""This stuff all started a few years ago, but because of permitting you are just now starting to see the fruits of everyone's labors,"" he said. ""What's occurring now is the biggest change to the Honolulu office market since the mid 1990s, when we built a whole lot of office buildings. That was an exciting time, but what followed was a pretty healthy recession and we never really worked out all the supply.""

Brown said demand for the remaining downtown office space will rise. He said Thursday that he received his first email since before the pandemic from an investor looking to make a downtown office investment. ""It's going to be turbocharged by all the other investments in downtown,"" Brown said.

New additions

Change is coming fast. The convenience store 88 Mart last year filled the Executive Centre space vacated by Longs in 2022. Paris Baguette opened on Bishop Street in February and Bratton said ""their opening days were better than any of their other Paris Baguette stores that have ever opened in the U.S.""

New opportunities will accompany Avalon's redevelopment of the Fort Street Walmart, which spans 87,000 square feet of space and 454 parking spaces, at South King and Bethel streets.

Camp said Avalon Group plans to build about 100 residential units above the property's parking garage and set aside half of the building for recreational entertainment and half for commercial use. The plan is to add a new tower behind Walmart with retail on the ground floor and about 300 units on top, she said.

Avalon's plans also include adding pickleball courts and a ""destination dog park"" for residents and guests outside of the building, she said.

Other Avalon downtown projects include consulting on the Diocese of Honolulu and Catholic Charities Hawaii's Housing Development Corporation's senior housing project Hale Kamiano. And the firm is working on Hawaii Pacific University's three-story Science Hall under construction.

Camp said downtown revitalization has been helped by the growing concentration of large business owners with common goals. She said Tradewind Capital Chairman Colbert Matsumoto is putting together a block of property owners who can move in sync with the first meeting planned for May.

She said existing owners are working together to beef up security to address concerns about crime and homelessness, and are exploring forming their own business improvement district.

""There's a Fort Street Improvement District already. But it's time for a downtown district. This is a place where major investment needs to be made,"" she said.",staradvertiser.com,news,Honolulu Star Advertiser,Allison Schaefers,0.2392156862745098,448971422,1,https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/web1_20240324-a1-CTY-modea-6119.jpg,

The military governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Serhiy Lysak, said falling debris damaged heating and power grids in the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih in the south. Consequently, six hospitals, more than 150 schools and 3,000 homes with 76,000 residents are temporarily without heating, he said.

According to the authorities, an unspecified critical infrastructure facility was also hit in the western Ukrainian region of Lviv. ""A fire broke out there. Firefighters are on duty,"" wrote regional governor Maksym Kosyzkyi on Telegram.

A few hours later, during a new nationwide air alert, two Russian hypersonic Kinschal missiles hit the same spot, Kosyzkyi said. The firefighters had been warned in good time and fled to safety, he said.

Western Ukraine appeared to be the focus of the attack. However, Russian missiles were also intercepted over the capital Kiev. Only one building façade was reported to have been damaged.

According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia's overnight attacks were launched from 14 strategic bombers over the Volga region.

In addition, 28 combat drones were launched from the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Ukrainian army intercepted 18 of the cruise missiles and 25 drones. The air defence was deployed in all parts of the country, the air force said.

After relative calm since the beginning of the year, this was the third heavy Russian airstrike within a few days.

(AP) -- April's total solar eclipse promises to be a scientific bonanza, thanks to new spacecraft and telescopes -- and cosmic chance.

The moon will be extra close to Earth, providing a long and intense period of darkness, and the sun should be more active with the potential for dramatic bursts of plasma. Then there's totality's densely populated corridor stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada.

Hundreds if not thousands of the tens of millions of spectators will double as ""citizen scientists,"" helping NASA and other research groups better understand our planet and star.

They'll photograph the sun's outer crownlike atmosphere, or corona, as the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blotting out sunlight for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds on April 8. They'll observe the quieting of birds and other animals as midday darkness falls. They'll also measure dropping temperatures, monitor clouds and use ham radios to gauge communication disruptions.

At the same time, rockets will blast off with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere. The small rockets will soar from Wallops Island, Virginia -- some 400 miles outside totality but with 81% of the sun obscured in a partial eclipse. Similar launches were conducted from New Mexico during last October's ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse that swept across the western U.S. and Central and South America.

""Time for the biggie! It is pretty exciting!!!"" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Aroh Barjatya, the rockets' mission director, said in an email.

NASA's high-altitude jets also will take to the air again, chasing the moon's shadow with improved telescopes to study the sun's corona and surrounding dust.

""Dust sounds boring,"" acknowledged NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck. ""But at the same time, dust is actually really interesting. Those are the leftover remnants from when the solar system was forming.""

More than 600 weather balloons will be launched by college students along the track, providing livestreams while studying atmospheric changes. Cloudy skies shouldn't matter.

""Lucky for us, the balloons flying to 80,000 feet and above don't care if it's cloudy on the ground,"" said Angela Des Jardins, an astrophysicist at Montana State University who's coordinating the nationwide project.

And if the Federal Aviation Administration approves, a 21-foot (6.5-meter) kite will lift a science instrument three miles (5 kilometers) above Texas in an experiment by the University of Hawaii's Shadia Habbal. She, too, wants to get above any clouds that might hamper her observations of the sun.

Normally hidden by the sun's glare, the corona is on full display during a total solar eclipse, making it a prime research target. The spiky tendrils emanating thousands of miles (kilometers) into space are mystifyingly hotter than the sun's surface -- in the millions of degrees, versus thousands.

""In terms of the value of total eclipses, science still cannot explain how the corona is heated to such extreme temperatures,"" said retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak, better known as Mr. Eclipse for all his charts and books on the subject.

The U.S. won't see another total solar eclipse on this scale until 2045, so NASA and everyone else is pulling out all the stops.

April's eclipse will begin in the Pacific and make landfall at Mazatlan, Mexico, heading up through Texas and 14 other U.S. states before crossing into Canada and exiting into the Atlantic at Newfoundland. Those outside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path, will get a partial eclipse.

Scientists got a taste of what's to come during the 2017 total solar eclipse that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. This time, the moon is closer to Earth, resulting in more minutes of darkness and a wider path.

""Any time we can observe for longer, that gives scientists more data,"" Korreck said.

Another scientific bonus this time: The sun will be just a year away from its maximum solar activity, as opposed to 2017 when it was near its minimum. That means lots more action at the sun, possibly even a coronal mass ejection during the eclipse, with massive amounts of plasma and magnetic field blasted into space.

Plus there are two new spacecraft out there studying the sun: NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter. They'll join other spacecraft on eclipse duty, including the International Space Station and its astronauts.

Closer to home, April's eclipse, unlike previous ones, will pass over three U.S. radar sites typically used for monitoring space weather. The stations will tune in to what's happening in the upper atmosphere as the skies dim.",courant.com,news,Hartfort Courant,Associated Press,0.05882352941176472,448971418,1,https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Total_Solar_Eclipse-Science_57717-2.jpg?w=640,

People in Tel Aviv shouted, ""Time is running out, bring them home!"" according to Israeli media reports.

The demonstrators set several small fires on the streets in the city centre and blocked a main traffic route.

Their calls were also directed against Netanyahu, whose critics say has failed to manage the crisis following the attacks by Palestinian Islamist Hamas on southern Israel in October, triggering the current war.

Protesters say Netanyahu is focusing more on ensuring his political survival than the release of the hostages kidnapped and taken to Gaza in the October 7 attacks. ""Whoever abandoned them must bring them back!"" they shouted.

Demonstrators demanded that Netanyahu's government resign and new elections be held, as was the case in similar rallies held since the war broke out.

One speaker said: ""My cousin Ofer has been a prisoner of Hamas for 169 days. And we have been prisoners of our government for 169 days.""

Up to 240 people were taken hostage by the Hamas militants who killed some 1,200 in their attacks. Israel responded with overwhelming ground and air attacks on Gaza, aiming to crush Hamas.

Just over 100 hostages were released during a ceasefire in November. Israel estimates some 100 hostages in Gaza are still alive.

The US, Egypt and Qatar have been mediating in ongoing negotiations to secure their release of the hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.

Several hundred people also demonstrated in front of Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem on Saturday evening.

Deforestation in the West African nation could contribute to water shortages, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited a recently-released UN report.

The study called for close monitoring of forest coverage to protect the city's main water sources, Reuters said.

Freetown is built on a forested peninsula, which is mostly made up of national parkland.

The water comes from reservoirs in the mountains -- but deforestation causes rain to drain off the hillsides rather than seeping through roots into the soil and streams, depleting important groundwater sources.

Freetown was designed for 400,000 residents, but is home to about 1.2 million residents and, according to the World Bank, is on track to reach 2 million within the decade.

Locals often struggle to access clean drinking water, explained Brima Jabbie, who is recognized by the community as the person in charge of maintaining order at the water source.

""The tap starts running around 2 p.m., but sometimes it doesn't until 4 p.m.,"" another resident told DW.

""So we hang out there and if it doesn't run on that day, we return home or take our buckets here to fetch water from this well,"" Zainab Favour Mason, a nursing mother told of her struggles to buy the scarce water that has become expensive.

""We suffer in this area to access water. The tap starts running and within seconds, the supply is cut. We come to the water well, but they say unless we pay,"" she added.

For pupils, like Fatmata Bundu taking a morning shower has become a luxury rather than a necessity.

""There are constraints for those of us going to school. It's hard to even access water in the morning for bathing and domestic work,"" Bundu told DW Freetown correspondent Claudia Anthony.

""The tap runs three days a week and sometimes it doesn't for a whole week. When we're late for school, we're punished,"" Bundu said, adding that her parents accuse her of not being patient enough to fetch water before she goes to school.

Bundu's concerns don't differ from Zino Thorpe's, a primary school teacher and parent.

""As citizens, it's heartbreaking to see us suffer to access water and as a result, many people like pupils and nursing mothers suffer. The tap doesn't run on time, when they choose, they open it at night when everyone has gone to sleep,"" Thorpe told DW.

To address water shortages for Freetown residents, several NGOs have set up the Western Area Peninsula Water Fund (WAPWF) to secure a sustainabe water supply for future generations.

The water fund will also protect the water sources in a forest and national park located west of the Freetown.

Several local laws guard natural water sources in this forest. But within this green belt, homes schools, and unregulated infrastructures have been erected, further aggravating an already dire situation.

However, Sierra Leone's Minister for Water Resources Sao-Kpato Hannah Max-Kyne warned of demolitions of illegal structures in protected areas.

""Those who have violated the law will be brought to book ... If you build your house in the waterway it will be brought down because if the dam bursts it would be a catastrophe,"" Max-Kyne emphasized.

""The issue of deforestation on the Western Area peninsula is tragic, worrying, and alarming,"" said Sierra Leone's Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai.

It will not only be an astronomical phenomenon, but will also have a significant impact on our lives from an astrological point of view.

In astrology, a solar eclipse symbolizes new beginnings, changes, and transformations. Astrologers told us more about how this event will affect all zodiac signs.

The solar eclipse in Aries on April 8, 2024, which will peak at 20:17 Kyiv time, promises to be a major event in the cosmic calendar.

The eclipse will affect everyone

An eclipse in astrology is also known as a conjunction or meeting of the Sun and the Moon. The Sun, which symbolizes the ego and the heart, will be perfectly aligned with the Moon, which symbolizes emotions and desires.

During the brief period when the satellite is blocking the Sun, all signs may temporarily lose their sense of reality. But afterward, you'll get a chance to embark on a new path that you've never even dreamed of.

People usually concentrate on what they can see directly in front of them, which often limits their perception and prevents them from seeing the possibilities offered by the universe. However, the total solar eclipse will finally help you expand your consciousness.

During this lunar period, we will all experience the effect of ""fading light"" as well. Do not shy away from this feeling, because it will force all zodiac signs to take responsibility and pave the way for a happy future.

Chiron - the comet of the ""wounded healer""

On April 8, 2024, Chiron will be right next to the total solar eclipse. It is a symbolic key that helps us unlock the wisdom that is hidden deep within.

It's time to be courageous even in the face of doubt. Recognize and understand that not all changes that occur during the eclipse season are negative.

Progressive activists and advocacy groups helped reelect City Councilmember Nithya Raman, while sending two other left-of-center candidates -- tenant rights attorney Ysabel Jurado and small business owner Jillian Burgos -- into runoffs against more moderate rivals.

""I think the results showed consistently across the board that when we show up, we win,"" said Bill Przylucki, executive director of Ground Game LA, a nonprofit advocacy group that has spent several years pushing the council to the left.

If Burgos and Jurado prevail in November, the number of council members with deeply progressive backgrounds will grow from three to five, making up a third of the 15-member council. Four of the five have campaigned alongside Democratic Socialists of America-Los Angeles. Burgos, the fifth, drew support from other big names in leftist political circles, including City Controller Kenneth Mejia and former mayoral candidate Gina Viola.

A five-member super-progressive voting bloc would have significant influence over homelessness, subsidized housing, tenant protections, public transit, the installation of bike lanes and the size of the Los Angeles Police Department.

The bloc would need only three more votes to pass legislation on a council where several members, including Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Katy Yaroslavsky, are left-of-center swing votes. Super progressives also would occupy additional seats on the council's committees, allowing them to shape policies from their inception, Przylucki said.

Some players in L.A. politics say the effect of the left in the primary is overstated. They point out that Councilmember John Lee, one of the council's centrist members, easily won his reelection bid in the northwest Valley. Another incumbent, Councilmember Imelda Padilla, coasted to reelection after securing support from public safety unions, construction trade unions, Valley business groups and others.

Raman won 50.7% of the vote, securing the majority she needed to win outright. But that victory simply preserved the existing political makeup of the council, said Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which waged an expensive but unsuccessful campaign against Raman.

""At the end of the day, there's been no net gain for any ideology on the council,"" he said. ""There's still three socialists on the council. That was before the election, that was after the election.""

Saggau said the police union has not yet decided how it will spend its resources in the upcoming runoffs.

L.A.'s progressive groups remain hopeful that Jurado and Burgos will win and shift the status quo.

Julio Marcial, senior vice president of the nonprofit Liberty Hill Foundation, said that expanding the council's super-progressive bloc would ensure that City Hall has a ""real, honest conversation"" about strategies for community safety. For Marcial, that means shifting money out of the LAPD and into affordable housing, expanded mental health services, job training and other programs.

""We can no longer follow the same playbook around budgeting, where we fully fund law enforcement and not the things that are proven to be effective in creating community safety,"" he said.

Burgos, who is running to represent an east San Fernando Valley district, said she's hoping that if she and Jurado win, other council members will be inclined to embrace more progressive policies.

""Right now, some people are afraid to make those choices,"" said Burgos, an optician who lives in North Hollywood and part owner of an interactive murder mystery theater company.

Burgos, 45, and Jurado, 34, have a long list of shared policy goals. Both want to repeal Municipal Code 41.18, which prohibits homeless encampments next to schools, daycare centers and ""sensitive"" locations such as senior centers and freeway overpasses. Both want to create ""social housing,"" assigning city agencies to buy, fix and manage low-cost apartment complexes.

The two candidates want to shift traffic enforcement out of the LAPD. And they're hoping to make bus and train fares free -- a more complicated goal, since the decision rests not with the council but Metro's 13-member board.

""We have a real opportunity to usher in a progressive era"" at the City Council, ""instead of just chipping away at some the solutions that we care about,"" said Jurado, who finished first in an eight-way race for the Eastside seat now held by Councilmember Kevin de León.

Burgos, who describes herself as a leftist, finished second in the race to replace Council President Paul Krekorian, who is stepping down at the end of the year. In first place is former State Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, a onetime Krekorian aide who describes himself as a ""pragmatic progressive.""

Nazarian secured 37% of the vote in the primary, compared with 22% for Burgos. In an interview, he said that he, too, has pushed for progressive policies, such as expanded public transit, increased funding to help students pay for college and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. In 2016 and again in 2020, Nazarian endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president in the Democratic primary.

""Judge me by my record. Judge me by my work ethic. There's a reason why, in a crowded field of seven people, that I was able to garner almost 40% of the vote,"" he said.

Nazarian, unlike Burgos, supports the continued use of 41.18. He also spoke in favor of Mayor Karen Bass' push to hire more police and raise their pay.

Burgos, asked about those two issues, called for more alternatives to police, saying in a statement that ""data has shown that there is no correlation between the number of sworn officers or the police budget and crime.""

De León, who came in second behind Jurado, also defended his progressive credentials, pointing to his work on immigrant rights, climate change and laws to prevent the displacement of renters in downtown, Boyle Heights and elsewhere.

""My record of taking on the toughest fights -- Sanctuary State, 100% clean renewable energy, tenant protections -- and winning for my constituents shows I know how to actually accomplish progressive change,"" said De León, a former president of the state Senate who is seeking a second term.

De León faces a tough second round. He is still dealing with the fallout from a scandal over his participation in a secretly recorded conversation that featured racist and derogatory remarks.

Like Nazarian, he supports the LAPD raises, the hiring of more police and the use of 41.18.

L.A.'s leftists made their first serious inroads at City Hall four years ago, helping to elect Raman, a member of Democratic Socialists of America, to the council. Labor unions and advocacy groups replicated that success in 2022, working to elect two more Democratic Socialists of America-backed candidates -- activist Eunisses Hernandez and labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martínez -- and ousting two incumbents.

Of the three, Raman has proved to be the most moderate. Like Nazarian, she sometimes refers to herself as a ""pragmatic progressive."" At one point in the primary campaign, she declined to say whether the city needs more police officers. At another, she relied on former Councilmember Paul Koretz -- who has drawn the ire of L.A.'s leftists -- to vouch for her with the Los Angeles County Democratic Party.

Attorney Edgar Khalatian, who represents real estate developers at City Hall, said he considers Raman to be pro-business. Raman, whose district straddles the Hollywood Hills, has shown ""a strong backbone"" on the city's efforts to build more housing, while also working to address the homelessness crisis, he said.

""The reason housing prices are as astronomical as they are is decades of elected officials not supporting the development of more housing,"" said Khalatian, who chairs the board of the Central City Assn., a downtown-based business group. ""She supports housing, and will take the political heat from people in her district when she supports that housing.""

Raman won despite more than $1.3 million in outside spending by the firefighters union, the police officers union, landlords and others for one of her opponents, Deputy City Atty. Ethan Weaver. Those groups waged a similar effort in the northwest Valley, spending a combined $1.1 million to help Lee turn back a challenge from nonprofit leader Serena Oberstein.

In South L.A.'s 10th Council District, law enforcement groups spent a combined $103,000 on ads portraying Reggie Jones-Sawyer, one of the five candidates, as soft on crime. Jones-Sawyer, a state assemblymember, came in fifth.

""For the rank-and-file of the league, we had a few goals"" in this year's city election, said Saggau, the police union spokesperson. ""One of them was to ensure that Reggie Jones-Sawyer did not bring his brand of criminal justice reform, or ideas, to the city of L.A., and we succeeded on that.""

The 10th District will instead see a runoff between Councilmember Heather Hutt and attorney Grace Yoo, who share the same views on some of the city's more contentious issues. Both support the city's package of police raises and 41.18.

A spokesperson for the Democratic Socialists of America's Los Angeles chapter said it's unlikely her organization will get involved in that contest, in part because neither candidate is a DSA member. Given that they both favor the police raises, it would be ""remarkably difficult"" for either to win the DSA's endorsement, said the spokesperson, who declined to give her full name.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,David Zahniser,0.2784313725490195,448971307,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/629fcbc2972f41c7685dd6f04041c7ab,

They want your money again.,"By Tony Bartelme and Nicholas Reynolds tbartelme@postandcourier.com nreynolds@postandcourier.com

Not so long ago, lawmakers and utilities were drunk on power -- nuclear power. In the late 2000s, South Carolina legislators rewrote rules for building new nuclear reactors, shifting risks away from utilities and onto the backs of their customers.

Flush with this money, SCANA and Santee Cooper began work on two reactors 30 miles north of Columbia. As the years passed and the delays grew, SCANA executives told the public and shareholders that the project was going well.

It wasn't, of course. Mismanagement and lax oversight had ignited a bonfire that torched $9 billion. Work on the reactors stopped, and criminal investigations began. It was South Carolina's most expensive scandal, one that led to lawsuits, prison for some executives, lost jobs for others and the sale of SCANA to Virginia-based Dominion Energy.

But the hangover from this debacle is wearing off. Old and new energy players are rushing in. This time they're pushing a plan to build a massive gas-fired generator at an old coal plant in the ACE Basin, coastal South Carolina's conservation jewel. A new gas pipeline would fuel the plant; the pipeline's route, size and price tag remain industry secrets.

Their playbook has echoes from the past. As they did for the nuclear project, power companies say that South Carolina is on the precipice of an energy crisis. As before, they argue their new plan will help them close dirtier coal plants. But there are new twists: Building a gas plant doesn't carry the same construction risks as a nuclear reactor. And some of the strains on the grid are new, including a race to build energy-gulping data centers.

As they did before, state lawmakers also are trying to help. They've introduced bills to make it easier for power companies to condemn land. Language in one bill would even open a door to building more nuclear reactors. Another provision would defang the utility's regulators.

Tom Ervin, a member of one of those watchdog agencies, was so upset that he quit in protest. ""South Carolina has been down this rocky road before,"" Ervin wrote in his resignation letter.

And as before, conservation groups and public watchdogs are challenging the utilities' plans and their cheerleading legislators. They say that utilities are gambling with ratepayers' money by making billion-dollar bets on climate-harming fossil fuels while dishing out discounts to manufacturers and data centers -- discounts unavailable to the public.

They say a large new pipeline project through the state carries its own set of risks, especially if it runs into opposition from landowners or cuts through environmentally sensitive areas.

And they say that the recent past is a powerful reminder about the consequences of bad choices and poor scrutiny, and how ratepayers often end up stuck paying for those mistakes.

This new push is ""the most significant threat to energy bills, our environment and public participation that we've seen in over 25 years,"" said John Tynan, president of Conservation Voters of South Carolina. The group on March 20 launched a $150,000 ad campaign to oppose a bill Tynan said would ""hand billion-dollar power companies a blank check.""

Seven years after news broke about South Carolina's nuclear fiasco, this latest power play once again carries stakes that involve billions of dollars, climate change and the reliability of the electric grid.

A deeper look at these stakes and lessons of the past could begin in many places, but why not start in a lobby?

Closed doors

The South Carolina Statehouse lobby has stained glass, leather couches and mahogany doors. Looking up, you see the interior of the building's dome, a kaleidoscope of browns and blues. During the session, lobbyists and lawmakers mill around a life-size statue of slavery apologist and former vice president John C. Calhoun. The lobby is an open place by design, where lobbyists mix with lawmakers, and school groups snake toward the chambers. But much of the real lawmaking occurs behind closed doors, as happened in 2007 when power companies needed a new law.

Nuclear reactors and their turbines can crank out large amounts of electricity without releasing greenhouse gasses. But they're wildly expensive to build and they generate radioactive waste. Wary utilities focused on other power-generating sources, especially coal and natural gas.

Then, in the mid-2000s, Westinghouse and Toshiba touted new reactor designs they said were safer and faster to construct. They would use prefabricated parts, ship them to work sites and assemble them there. The technology looked good on paper, but the construction process hadn't been tested in the field.

As in many states, South Carolina's investor-owned power companies are regulated monopolies. When these utilities build generators, pipelines and transmission lines, they typically recover their costs from their customers and take a percentage as profits. In other words, the more they spend, the more they make. (Santee Cooper is a state-owned, not-for-profit utility.)

But erecting nuclear plants remained expensive and risky, risks that utilities didn't want their shareholders to shoulder alone if something went wrong. So they turned to our elected officials.

One of those closed-door meetings in 2007 was in a conference room of Haynsworth Sinkler Boyd, a politically influential law firm that then had an office next to the Capitol grounds. The meeting's host was Belton Ziegler, one of the firm's lawyers at the time and former general counsel for SCANA. Zeigler had helped draft a new bill called the Base Load Review Act.

The meeting was supposed to be a chance for manufacturers to weigh in on the act. But some attendees recall Zeigler casting most of their suggestions aside.

""I can remember when we hit a brick wall, Belton would say 'I hear you,' "" Scott Elliott, an attorney for the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, told The Post and Courier in 2017. Elliott took that ""I hear you"" as a polite way of saying the act's language was already etched in stone.

Zeigler declined to comment for this story.

South Carolina lawmakers in 2007 quickly passed the Base Load Review Act, greased by thousands of dollars in utility campaign contributions. It began with the words: ""An act to protect South Carolina ratepayers.""

Shifting the risks

At least 10 other states passed laws similar to the Base Load Review Act. It was a dramatic shift. In the past, utilities often borrowed money to pay for big-dollar infrastructure projects, much like a grocer taking out a loan to build a new store. But the Base Load Review Act and its ilk used financial tools to shovel more risks onto the backs of their customers.

These tools went by mind-numbing acronyms, such as ACR for ""advanced cost recovery,"" and CWIP, short for ""construction work in progress."" The wonky language hid their power: These tools were magic wands that allowed electric utilities to bill their customers as they designed and erected new power plants. It was akin to paying a grocer as it built a new store with the hope that the company would charge less for groceries in the future.

Power companies said these cost recovery tools would save customers money in the long run by lowering overall borrowing costs. In practice, utilities here and across the nation began to set their customers' money on fire.

Mississippi Power tried to build a ""clean coal"" natural gas plant in rural Kemper County with technology designed to capture carbon dioxide. Power bills rose 15 percent in 2015 as delays and costs ballooned. The utility eventually lost more than $6.4 billion before scrapping the project altogether.

In Ohio, federal officials arrested the state's House speaker on charges he sought $60 million in bribes to help pass a $1.3 billion bailout for two nuclear plants. In sentencing the lawmaker to 20 years, a judge said: ""You were not serving the people. You were serving yourself.""

Near Augusta, Georgia Power's Vogtle nuclear reactors took more than 14 years and $35 billion to build and are only now coming online. The project will add 10 percent to an average customer's monthly bill.

Closer to home, SCANA executives tried to hide delays and growing costs for the V.C. Summer nuclear project. But the problems were too large to cover up. When the utilities pulled the plug, SCANA's 700,000 customers had already ponied up more than $2 billion for a project that would never generate a watt. The failure would cost Santee Cooper customers an extra $13 a month for four decades, an executive would later tell The Post and Courier.

Two top SCANA executives pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in a crime that created a ""nuclear ghost town,"" then-acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart said. Facing shareholder lawsuits, SCANA sold its company to Dominion, a utility based in Virginia. The head of Santee Cooper lost his job amid calls to sell Santee Cooper outright.

Burned, South Carolina lawmakers in 2018 repealed the Base Load Review Act. They strengthened the South Carolina Public Service Commission, the agency that regulates the state's utilities.

For a moment, the balance of power had tilted back toward the public.

Wakeup call

The jet stream is a powerful river of air that shoots across the United States, determining much of our weather in the process. Its undulations can push cold air south or pull warmer air north. Scientists have posited that a rapidly warming planet causes these undulations to swing even more deeply. Just before Christmas in 2022, the jet stream dipped sharply south. Arctic air swept across the South, pushing utilities' grids to the breaking point, and then past it.

Power plants across the nation buckled. Freezing temperatures triggered mechanical failures -- more than 1,700 generating units and associated infrastructure. Nearly half of those failing elements involved natural gas generation and transmission, a federal report found. In the Carolinas, about 500,000 customers in North Carolina and 100,000 customers in South Carolina temporarily lost power. It was a massive failure of the nation's natural gas infrastructure, and it's unclear whether an additional gas plant in the Lowcountry would have made a difference that Christmas, but utility officials cite it as a wakeup call.

""This happened in areas that had a lot of growth -- Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina -- and all of those areas were cold at the same time,"" said Michael Couick, chief executive officer of the Electric Cooperatives of South Carolina, a group that represents 18 consumer-owned electric utilities. ""We were lucky that it happened on a Christmas vacation day when schools and industry were closed.""

Dominion's control facility near Columbia is another place to experience the dance utilities do to keep power on. Through a guard gate and past metal detectors, you enter a cavernous room. Its black walls frame a curving array of maps and monitors and blinking lights. From this nerve center, workers tweak a large part of South Carolina's electric grid.

Dominion has approximately 5,604 megawatt hours of dispatchable power in South Carolina at any given time. Some comes from coal, a reliable source of electricity that also generates enormous amounts of pollution and greenhouse gases. As coal costs grew, utilities across the country converted plants to natural gas or shuttered them, and Dominion is part of that trend. It plans to convert two coal units into ones fueled by natural gas by 2028. Two other units, the Wateree station in Richland County and Williams station in Berkeley County, are scheduled for closure in 2030. Meantime, the utility added 40,000 new accounts since taking over SCANA's business five years ago.

The utility has few other options than natural gas to meet the grid's demands, Dominion South Carolina President Keller Kissam said during a recent walk-through. At times, more than 40 percent of the utility's power comes from solar panels, but Dominion reaches that number only when the sun is shining. Dominion had no solar power available during the Christmas 2022 crisis, he said. As Kissam spoke, rain fell across South Carolina, and the room's monitors showed solar power levels fluctuating.

Engineers also can flip switches to tweak the grid's hydroelectric generators. When consumers are using less energy, engineers can pump water from a low reservoir to a higher one. Then, during heavy demand, they can release the water, generating a 600-megawatt swing in just 15 minutes. But building new hydropower also faces a daunting set of approvals.

This balancing act has grown more difficult amid the proliferation of new data centers, cryptocurrency miners, manufacturing and the move toward electric vehicles, utility officials and energy experts say.

A large data center can use as much electricity as 80,000 households, a recent McKinsey report said. In 2022, the country's 2,700 data centers used about 4 percent of the nation's electricity. By 2024, those centers will use 6 percent of the country's electric generation, the International Energy Agency said.

Cryptocurrency mining factories also use enormous amounts of energy, enough power in some cases to power 10,000 homes. South Carolina has seen announcements of a half-dozen new Bitcoin mining centers in the Upstate during the past three years. Worldwide, capital spending to meet these growing energy demands will increase from $2.8 trillion to $4 trillion in 2030, the International Energy Agency said.

Locally, some of this spending could happen 80 miles south of Dominion's Columbia nerve center, along the banks of the Edisto River.

Future gas plant?

Dominion's Canadys site sits on the Edisto in a swampy area next to Colleton State Park. For decades, a coal-fired power plant pumped out electricity. Today that plant is closed, but with lawmakers' help, Dominion and Santee Cooper hope to build a massive gas-fired power station there.

Dominion said the Canadys site makes sense because it owns the land and has existing transmission lines and substations nearby. (Another contending site in Hampton County is closer to large gas lines. But Santee Cooper has said it prefers the Canadys site.)

In Canadys, a small natural gas pipeline runs to the area, but the utility would need a much larger one. Interstate pipelines can be 2 to 3 feet in diameter and require a roughly 100-foot-wide path for construction. Existing supply junctions are near Savannah and Augusta, but the utilities have yet to spell out how large the pipeline will be and where in South Carolina it will go.

The lack of information worries conservation groups, who fear a large new pipeline could affect the ACE Basin, an estuary of three Lowcountry rivers that has long been celebrated for protecting large expanses of public and private property.

""Pipeline projects destroy habitat, harm local wildlife, damage air and water quality, put people at risk of explosions and leaks, and threaten our private property rights,"" said Kate Mixson, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center.

The gas plant itself would be a ""combined cycle"" generator, which uses excess heat to produce more power than earlier designs. During 2022 and 2023, 13 combined cycle plants went online, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Such plants pollute much less than coal-fired units but still generate carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Dominion and Santee Cooper have said the Canadys plant could generate upwards of 2,000 megawatts, rivaling what the failed V.C. Summer nuclear project would have cranked out.

Neither Dominion nor Santee Cooper have put a price tag on the plant or the pipeline, though industry and government estimates show a gas plant that size typically costs at least $2 billion.

Construction of gas plants carry much fewer risks than nuclear reactors. But powering turbines with natural gas carries long-term perils, especially if gas prices rise or government restrictions on carbon dioxide grow stiffer. Dominion and Santee Cooper have acknowledged these risks, but they don't exactly highlight them in their public planning documents.

In Santee Cooper's 236-master energy plan, the utility said ratepayers could be on the hook for an extra $2.8 billion if natural gas prices rise. If utilities end up paying for carbon dioxide emissions, a plausible scenario given the planet's climate emergency, ratepayers could get smacked by an additional $14 billion.

Despite the risks, state lawmakers are rushing in to help the utilities build the gas plant -- and more.

In this case, the bill is called ""South Carolina Ten-Year Energy Transformation Act.""

Business SC energy regulator quits over bill that would reduce oversight of electric utilities By John McDermott jmcdermott@postandcourier.com Base Load 2.0?

Among its many provisions, the bill would reduce the number of S.C. Public Service Commissioners from seven to three. It would open the door to building small modular nuclear reactors. And if the utilities decide to abandon a nuclear project, they must provide a ""fulsome accounting"" of the costs -- language that had critics scratching their heads about how ""fulsome"" might be defined.

Early versions of the bill required regulators to give more weight to what utilities said about their plans than the public. The bill also would make it easier for utilities to build new pipelines.

""This bill puts the state government in the pipeline business, not only across sensitive wetlands and the Edisto River, but potentially all over the state,"" said Eddy Moore of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, adding that lawmakers are poised to vote on a bill even though they don't know where the plant and pipeline will go, how much it will cost and whose land might be taken.

As the Base Load Review Act did in 2007, the new bill is moving quickly through a legislature that once spent five months arguing about whether to name the right whale or bottlenose dolphin the state marine mammal.

As they did before the V.C. Summer debacle, power companies ramped up their lobbying. Dominion, Santee Cooper and Duke Energy spent more than $2.6 million to lobby state lawmakers during the past three years, public filings show.

Unlike 2007, some are warning about the speed of the process and the decrease in public scrutiny implicit in the bill's language.

Tom Ervin, a former circuit court judge, saw what was happening and quit his post on the South Carolina Public Service Commission.

In a blistering letter on March 13 to lawmakers, Ervin said the new bill would gut regulators of their hard-earned expertise, open the door to back-room deals and give utilities ""a blank check with guaranteed profits, resulting in much higher utility rates for residential customers.""

He suggested that the General Assembly put a temporary freeze on energy-hogging data centers and crypto-mining operations. He noted that a new natural gas pipeline would carry all sorts of potential risks that could leave ratepayers on the hook for billions of dollars.

""There are simply too many unanswered questions and concerns that need to be addressed,"" he wrote.

Business SC power utilities tee up new projects as demand strains the grid By David Wren dwren@postandcourier.com Rerun?

Away from the Statehouse lobby, in the bowels of a nearby office building, House lawmakers held hearings about the bill.

Pro-power plant representatives spoke about the vulnerability of the state's electric grid and South Carolina's booming economy. But most speakers opposed the bill.

Most opponents said they supported more energy production, but not if it meant weakening the public's ability to regulate monopoly utilities. Or foregoing harder looks at solar power and other climate-friendly sources.

House lawmakers tweaked the bill but left much of the language intact as it moved through a committee. At one point, John Brooker, energy policy director for the Conservation Voters of South Carolina, asked a question that went to the heart of the issue: If the gas plant plan is the most cost-effective way to meet the state's energy challenges, why do utilities need to undermine regulators? ""Why can't it stand on its own merits?""

As they did in 2007, lawmakers over the next few months will cut through the Statehouse lobby. They'll head to chambers and committee rooms, reworking how South Carolina builds new power plants -- and how the public might weigh in.

And as happened in 2007, their work could ripple through the grid and ratepayers' pocketbooks for a generation.

Moments later, Alaka'i Kiakona's flyball to center caught a jet stream and suddenly sailed over outfielder Nico Low's head for a triple, scoring Osbun.

Kamehameha remains unbeaten in the ILH with a 3-0 record, trailing Saint Louis (4-0).

""It's the ILH. Both teams were outstanding,"" Warriors coach Daryl Kitagawa said. ""It's what we expect from Maryknoll. (Pitcher Allin) Yap was great. We just tried our best to put ourselves in scoring position. We were very fortunate to come out with a win today. Hat's off to Maryknoll and coach Alaka'i (Aglipay) and his staff, and hat's off to our team, as well. We got lucky.""

Kamehameha's clutch win outshined a fantastic seven-inning, one-hit performance by Maryknoll ace Yap, who lost 15 pounds during a recent week-long bout with pneumonia.

""I ate a lot to gain my weight back,"" the junior said. ""A lot of Hot Pockets.""

The 6-foot-2 southpaw struck out 12 and walked four before reaching his pitch limit. Yap was clutch, coming through with key strikeouts in the sixth and seventh innings for Maryknoll to stymie the Warriors.

The speedy Yap did make a mistake on the basepaths, however, in the bottom of the fourth inning. After leading off with a single and advancing to third on Jacob Remily's single, he was thrown out at home plate on a Luke Swartman's flyball, which was caught in short left field by Osbun, who make a pinpoint throw to catcher Taj Uyehara.

""My (third-base) coach didn't send me. I did that on my own,"" Yap said. ""I hesitated, then I said, I'm going. It was a good throw.""

Aglipay showed some mercy on his player.

""It's got to be a perfect throw to get him. If anyone wants to do it, with his speed, Allin could do it. Plus, he's out there pitching great,"" he said.

The Spartans (1-4) had runners in scoring position in the fifth and sixth innings but came up empty. They were 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position against Kamehameha hurlers Kiakona and Elai Iwanaga.

Kiakona went 4 1/3 innings before hitting his pitch limit for the week. The lefty allowed three hits, struck out four and hit two batters but remained in the game as Kamehameha's cleanup hitter.

""My fastball and changeup were working, my curveball to lefties. Sometimes I was leaving the fastball up, but overall, I think I did pretty well,"" Kiakona said. ""I love these kind of games because it keeps the whole team in it and it puts our strength to the test, which is our pitching.""

Iwanaga, a right-hander, allowed just one hit in 3 2/3 innings with five strikeouts, one hit batter and one wild pitch.

""I was ready to pitch, staying warm. My slider was really good. I was working the splitter in the pen, but my coach didn't call it,"" Iwanaga said.",staradvertiser.com,news,Honolulu Star Advertiser,Paul Honda,0.07450980392156858,448971267,1,https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/web1_SPT-bal-ksk-bb-34.jpg,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.

The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The moon will be extra close to Earth, providing a long and intense period of darkness, and the sun should be more active with the potential for dramatic bursts of plasma. Then there's totality's densely populated corridor stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada.

Hundreds if not thousands of the tens of millions of spectators will double as ""citizen scientists,"" helping NASA and other research groups better understand our planet and star.

They'll photograph the sun's outer crownlike atmosphere, or corona, as the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blotting out sunlight for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds on April 8. They'll observe the quieting of birds and other animals as midday darkness falls. They'll also measure dropping temperatures, monitor clouds and use ham radios to gauge communication disruptions.

At the same time, rockets will blast off with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere. The small rockets will soar from Wallops Island, Virginia -- some 400 miles outside totality but with 81% of the sun obscured in a partial eclipse. Similar launches were conducted from New Mexico during last October's ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse that swept across the western U.S. and Central and South America.

""Time for the biggie! It is pretty exciting!!!"" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Aroh Barjatya, the rockets' mission director, said in an email.

NASA's high-altitude jets also will take to the air again, chasing the moon's shadow with improved telescopes to study the sun's corona and surrounding dust.

""Dust sounds boring,"" acknowledged NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck. ""But at the same time, dust is actually really interesting. Those are the leftover remnants from when the solar system was forming.""

More than 600 weather balloons will be launched by college students along the track, providing livestreams while studying atmospheric changes. Cloudy skies shouldn't matter.

""Lucky for us, the balloons flying to 80,000 feet and above don't care if it's cloudy on the ground,"" said Angela Des Jardins, an astrophysicist at Montana State University who's coordinating the nationwide project.

And if the Federal Aviation Administration approves, a 21-foot (6.5-meter) kite will lift a science instrument three miles (5 kilometers) above Texas in an experiment by the University of Hawaii's Shadia Habbal. She, too, wants to get above any clouds that might hamper her observations of the sun.

Normally hidden by the sun's glare, the corona is on full display during a total solar eclipse, making it a prime research target. The spiky tendrils emanating thousands of miles (kilometers) into space are mystifyingly hotter than the sun's surface -- in the millions of degrees, versus thousands.

""In terms of the value of total eclipses, science still cannot explain how the corona is heated to such extreme temperatures,"" said retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak, better known as Mr. Eclipse for all his charts and books on the subject.

The U.S. won't see another total solar eclipse on this scale until 2045, so NASA and everyone else is pulling out all the stops.

April's eclipse will begin in the Pacific and make landfall at Mazatlan, Mexico, heading up through Texas and 14 other U.S. states before crossing into Canada and exiting into the Atlantic at Newfoundland. Those outside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path, will get a partial eclipse.

Scientists got a taste of what's to come during the 2017 total solar eclipse that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. This time, the moon is closer to Earth, resulting in more minutes of darkness and a wider path.

""Any time we can observe for longer, that gives scientists more data,"" Korreck said.

Another scientific bonus this time: The sun will be just a year away from its maximum solar activity, as opposed to 2017 when it was near its minimum. That means lots more action at the sun, possibly even a coronal mass ejection during the eclipse, with massive amounts of plasma and magnetic field blasted into space.

Plus there are two new spacecraft out there studying the sun: NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter. They'll join other spacecraft on eclipse duty, including the International Space Station and its astronauts.

Closer to home, April's eclipse, unlike previous ones, will pass over three U.S. radar sites typically used for monitoring space weather.

The President of Pakistan conferred that award on her on the Pakistan Day in recognition of her ""outstanding contribution"" towards strengthening Pakistan-U.S. relations.

""The efforts by Ms. Power are a reflection of her commitment to assist the people of Pakistan and forge a strong and deep partnership between Pakistan and the US,"" stated the citation that was read out the occasion.

Ms. Power, who has been serving as USAID chief since May 2021, is a proponent of strong Pakistan-US cooperation in humanitarian and socio-economic sectors like health, education and climate change and promoting people to people exchanges.

""As USAID administrator, she was instrumental in the provision of significant life-saving US humanitarian assistance to mitigate the disastrous impacts of the floods in 2022,"" the citation said.

In a video message, she also recalled the devastation when one-third of Pakistan was inundated due to devastating floods in 2022.

""I will never forget visiting Pakistan in September of 2022. Flying over the floods, feeling sure that I was flying over an ocean, only to be reminded that the ocean was in fact hundreds of miles away. And there were entire towns submerged under the seemingly infinite expanse of water below.""

She spoke about the support from the highest levels of the White House and both houses of the US Congress that facilitated an assistance of $215 million to the flood affected people.

Ms. Power also referred to the support from private American citizens and American companies who rallied to Pakistan's aid, donating more than $37 million to support the relief efforts.

""Our mission is helping the people of Pakistan to improve water management systems, build markets for Climate Smart Agriculture technologies and techniques and mobilized climate adaptation finance under the US-Pakistan green Alliance initiative,"" Ms. Power said.

""We remain committed to standing with Pakistan as it continues the long and difficult recovery from the floods while building a more resilient and more prosperous future.""

Congratulating Ms. Power on receiving the award, Ambassador Masood Khan said that she is a true friend of the people of Pakistan.

""We will never forget her humanitarian services at a time when we needed them the most,"" he said.

Or maybe super progressives, given how much they want to reshape politics in Los Angeles.

Whatever the label, candidates on the left end of the political spectrum made crucial advances in the March 5 primary election for City Council, setting the stage for some hard-fought runoff campaigns and potentially, an expansion of their power by the end of the year.

Progressive activists and advocacy groups helped reelect City Councilmember Nithya Raman, while sending two other left-of-center candidates -- tenant rights attorney Ysabel Jurado and small business owner Jillian Burgos -- into runoffs against more moderate rivals.

""I think the results showed consistently across the board that when we show up, we win,"" said Bill Przylucki, executive director of Ground Game LA, a nonprofit advocacy group that has spent several years pushing the council to the left.

If Burgos and Jurado prevail in November, the number of council members with deeply progressive backgrounds will grow from three to five, making up a third of the 15-member council. Four of the five have campaigned alongside Democratic Socialists of America-Los Angeles. Burgos, the fifth, drew support from other big names in leftist political circles, including City Controller Kenneth Mejia and former mayoral candidate Gina Viola.

A five-member super-progressive voting bloc would have significant influence over homelessness, subsidized housing, tenant protections, public transit, the installation of bike lanes and the size of the Los Angeles Police Department.

The bloc would need only three more votes to pass legislation on a council where several members, including Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Katy Yaroslavsky, are left-of-center swing votes. Super progressives also would occupy additional seats on the council's committees, allowing them to shape policies from their inception, Przylucki said.

Some players in L.A. politics say the effect of the left in the primary is overstated. They point out that Councilmember John Lee, one of the council's centrist members, easily won his reelection bid in the northwest Valley. Another incumbent, Councilmember Imelda Padilla, coasted to reelection after securing support from public safety unions, construction trade unions, Valley business groups and others.

Raman won 50.7% of the vote, securing the majority she needed to win outright. But that victory simply preserved the existing political makeup of the council, said Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which waged an expensive but unsuccessful campaign against Raman.

""At the end of the day, there's been no net gain for any ideology on the council,"" he said. ""There's still three socialists on the council. That was before the election, that was after the election.""

Saggau said the police union has not yet decided how it will spend its resources in the upcoming runoffs.

L.A.'s progressive groups remain hopeful that Jurado and Burgos will win and shift the status quo.

Julio Marcial, senior vice president of the nonprofit Liberty Hill Foundation, said that expanding the council's super-progressive bloc would ensure that City Hall has a ""real, honest conversation"" about strategies for community safety. For Marcial, that means shifting money out of the LAPD and into affordable housing, expanded mental health services, job training and other programs.

""We can no longer follow the same playbook around budgeting, where we fully fund law enforcement and not the things that are proven to be effective in creating community safety,"" he said.

Burgos, who is running to represent an east San Fernando Valley district, said she's hoping that if she and Jurado win, other council members will be inclined to embrace more progressive policies.

""Right now, some people are afraid to make those choices,"" said Burgos, an optician who lives in North Hollywood and part owner of an interactive murder mystery theater company.

Burgos, 45, and Jurado, 34, have a long list of shared policy goals. Both want to repeal Municipal Code 41.18, which prohibits homeless encampments next to schools, daycare centers and ""sensitive"" locations such as senior centers and freeway overpasses. Both want to create ""social housing,"" assigning city agencies to buy, fix and manage low-cost apartment complexes.

The two candidates want to shift traffic enforcement out of the LAPD. And they're hoping to make bus and train fares free -- a more complicated goal, since the decision rests not with the council but Metro's 13-member board.

""We have a real opportunity to usher in a progressive era"" at the City Council, ""instead of just chipping away at some the solutions that we care about,"" said Jurado, who finished first in an eight-way race for the Eastside seat now held by Councilmember Kevin de León.

Burgos, who describes herself as a leftist, finished second in the race to replace Council President Paul Krekorian, who is stepping down at the end of the year. In first place is former State Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, a onetime Krekorian aide who describes himself as a ""pragmatic progressive.""

Nazarian secured 37% of the vote in the primary, compared with 22% for Burgos. In an interview, he said that he, too, has pushed for progressive policies, such as expanded public transit, increased funding to help students pay for college and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. In 2016 and again in 2020, Nazarian endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president in the Democratic primary.

""Judge me by my record. Judge me by my work ethic. There's a reason why, in a crowded field of seven people, that I was able to garner almost 40% of the vote,"" he said.

Nazarian, unlike Burgos, supports the continued use of 41.18. He also spoke in favor of Mayor Karen Bass' push to hire more police and raise their pay.

Burgos, asked about those two issues, called for more alternatives to police, saying in a statement that ""data has shown that there is no correlation between the number of sworn officers or the police budget and crime.""

De León, who came in second behind Jurado, also defended his progressive credentials, pointing to his work on immigrant rights, climate change and laws to prevent the displacement of renters in downtown, Boyle Heights and elsewhere.

""My record of taking on the toughest fights -- Sanctuary State, 100% clean renewable energy, tenant protections -- and winning for my constituents shows I know how to actually accomplish progressive change,"" said De León, a former president of the state Senate who is seeking a second term.

De León faces a tough second round. He is still dealing with the fallout from a scandal over his participation in a secretly recorded conversation that featured racist and derogatory remarks.

Like Nazarian, he supports the LAPD raises, the hiring of more police and the use of 41.18.

L.A.'s leftists made their first serious inroads at City Hall four years ago, helping to elect Raman, a member of Democratic Socialists of America, to the council. Labor unions and advocacy groups replicated that success in 2022, working to elect two more Democratic Socialists of America-backed candidates -- activist Eunisses Hernandez and labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martínez -- and ousting two incumbents.

Of the three, Raman has proved to be the most moderate. Like Nazarian, she sometimes refers to herself as a ""pragmatic progressive."" At one point in the primary campaign, she declined to say whether the city needs more police officers. At another, she relied on former Councilmember Paul Koretz -- who has drawn the ire of L.A.'s leftists -- to vouch for her with the Los Angeles County Democratic Party.

Attorney Edgar Khalatian, who represents real estate developers at City Hall, said he considers Raman to be pro-business. Raman, whose district straddles the Hollywood Hills, has shown ""a strong backbone"" on the city's efforts to build more housing, while also working to address the homelessness crisis, he said.

""The reason housing prices are as astronomical as they are is decades of elected officials not supporting the development of more housing,"" said Khalatian, who chairs the board of the Central City Assn., a downtown-based business group. ""She supports housing, and will take the political heat from people in her district when she supports that housing.""

Raman won despite more than $1.3 million in outside spending by the firefighters union, the police officers union, landlords and others for one of her opponents, Deputy City Atty. Ethan Weaver. Those groups waged a similar effort in the northwest Valley, spending a combined $1.1 million to help Lee turn back a challenge from nonprofit leader Serena Oberstein.

In South L.A.'s 10th Council District, law enforcement groups spent a combined $103,000 on ads portraying Reggie Jones-Sawyer, one of the five candidates, as soft on crime. Jones-Sawyer, a state assemblymember, came in fifth.

""For the rank-and-file of the league, we had a few goals"" in this year's city election, said Saggau, the police union spokesperson. ""One of them was to ensure that Reggie Jones-Sawyer did not bring his brand of criminal justice reform, or ideas, to the city of L.A., and we succeeded on that.""

The 10th District will instead see a runoff between Councilmember Heather Hutt and attorney Grace Yoo, who share the same views on some of the city's more contentious issues. Both support the city's package of police raises and 41.18.

A spokesperson for the Democratic Socialists of America's Los Angeles chapter said it's unlikely her organization will get involved in that contest, in part because neither candidate is a DSA member. Given that they both favor the police raises, it would be ""remarkably difficult"" for either to win the DSA's endorsement, said the spokesperson, who declined to give her full name.",latimes.com,news,Los Angeles Times,David Zahniser,0.2941176470588236,448970690,1,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b63d3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1400x788+0+56/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F5e%2F21eaaafe439d9a7a8f7b3ca39548%2Fla-me-jurado-burgos-raman.jpg,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

""Above all, we ask the Russian Federation to end its terrorist airstrikes against the population and territory of Ukraine, to end the war and to focus on the country's own internal problems,"" foreign ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said in a statement.

Following a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine by Russia, Poland activated ""all air defence systems, all air force systems"", the country's Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

He said that the missile would have been shot down ""had there been any indication it was heading for a target on Polish territory"".

The army said the missile, which was travelling at almost 800 kilometres per hour (500 mph) around 400 metres (1,300 feet) above the ground, had crossed about two kilometres over the border into Poland.

""Polish airspace was breached by one of the cruise missiles fired in the night by the air forces... of the Russian Federation,"" the army wrote on X.

""The object flew through Polish airspace above the village of Oserdow (Lublin province) and stayed for 39 seconds,"" the statement said, adding that it was tracked by military radar throughout its flight.

""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on permanent alert to ensure the security of Polish airspace,"" the army said.

A similar incident occurred on December 29, 2023, when a Russian missile penetrated Polish airspace for several minutes before returning to Ukraine.

In November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, close to the Ukrainian border.

Everyone in the U.S. will see at least a partial solar eclipse, but only those within the 115-mile-wide (185 kilometers) path of totality will witness the sun's face completely blocked by the moon's shadow for up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds.

Only during totality -- when the sun's face is completely blocked -- is it safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun's corona with the naked eye. At all other times, including during the partial phase of the eclipse, you must wear certified solar eclipse glasses to view the sun.

There are some safety issues to be aware of at other times, too. Here are six tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable viewing of the solar eclipse.

Solar eclipse glasses are plentiful and inexpensive. Buy them before stocks run low, and get them only from this list of verified suppliers of safe solar filters and viewers on the American Astronomical Society's AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force website. Only then can you be sure that they comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard, which means they reduce visible sunlight to safe and comfortable levels and block all but a tiny fraction of solar UV and IR radiation.

Do NOT use sunglasses, solar filters meant for cameras and telescopes, smoked glass, welder's goggles, photographic or X-ray film, potato-chip bags or DVDs to view the partially eclipsed sun. None of these methods are safe.

You can use solar eclipse glasses to look at the sun anytime. Typically, however, solar eclipse glasses are used to view the sun from the moment the moon starts to cross it -- a time known as first contact. You must use solar eclipse glasses to look at the eclipse whenever the sun is only partially covered, which is the entire time on April 8 for most of North America.

Although the path of totality on April 8 will include several major cities and metropolitan areas, it crosses a lot of backcountry. Many people will chase clear skies, which could take them to areas they hadn't planned on visiting. Remote parts of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, in particular, are short on facilities and gas stations. So bring everything you need, including a full fuel tank and extra food, water, cash and toilet paper.

In April, you can expect the unexpected, with everything from snow in the Northeast to tornadoes in the Midwest. In remote areas of the northeastern U.S. and Canada, the mountains, lakes and forests may provide a beautiful backdrop, but conditions in the backcountry that time of year can be difficult.

""Since visitors may not be familiar with the area's ever-changing weather and early spring conditions, our most important role is to share important information about being safe and well-prepared and about the planned events throughout the region,"" representatives from the Adirondacks' Regional Office of Sustainable Tourism (ROOST) said in a statement.

ROOST encourages people to avoid mountain trails and waters. Read up on the climate along the eclipse track, look at weather forecasts and decide the best place to watch the eclipse the day before the event.

If you decide to watch the eclipse from a city sidewalk -- perhaps even during a lunch break at work -- then watch out. Wandering into roads and other dangerous situations is easier than you might think when you're looking through solar eclipse glasses. The best, easiest and safest eclipse-observing site is an open space or park, which will likely have a much better view of the eclipse than city streets, where buildings could easily block the view.

The biggest cities inside the path are Mazatlán and Torreón, Mexico; San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Hamilton, Ontario; Montreal Quebec.

Relocating at the last minute in search of clear weather is not particularly recommended unless the roads are clear and you have multiple backup plans. An excellent way to monitor the traffic situation both before and after the eclipse is to use Google Maps or similar apps to monitor live traffic information.

However, you need to know your destination. A great way to begin your research is to use an interactive eclipse map and note the eclipse schedules for various locations in advance. Fred Espenak's Road Atlas for the Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 and Michael Zeiler's Field Guide to the 2023 and 2024 Solar Eclipses ensure you have a spiral-bound hard copy of the path of totality in case you lose your cellphone connection.

Locals demand protection of fragile ecology, land autonomy","SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Wangchuk recently posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh & continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""",seattletimes.com,news,The Seattle Times,Aijaz Hussain,-0.2,448970608,1,,

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Soon, people living in North America will get to experience their first solar eclipse in almost a decade.

Even though the last solar eclipse in North America happened in 2017, the next one isn't expected until August 2044, so seizing this moment is critical. More than just a peculiar shadow, the solar eclipse is a perfect opportunity to hang out with loved ones outside and meditate on humanity's smallness compared to the vast universe.

""It's an alignment of the sun, the moon, and the earth in such a way that the moon passes directly between the sun and the earth, blocking the sun's rays from reaching the earth's surface,"" says Noah Petro, an Artemis III project scientist at NASA. If you're in the path of totality, then you will see the moon completely cover the sun. Outside of the main path? You may still see a partial eclipse, where the moon covers a slice of the sun.

Despite the involvement of the moon, a solar eclipse is not to be confused with a lunar eclipse. During those, the moon passes into the shadow of Earth and turns a dark red color. Lunar eclipses are visible for most of the entire hemisphere that's facing the moon at the time.

Passing through portions of North America, the total solar eclipse will occur on Monday, April 8. Depending on where you are in the path of totality, the solar eclipse will happen in the afternoon and potentially last around four minutes. For more specifics, refer to NASA's map detailing the exact time different US cities will experience the eclipse.

While the total solar eclipse is primarily happening in Mexico and the United States, a small section of eastern Canada is also along the path of totality. To see what it might look like in different locations, check out this fantastic website created by a retired mathematician that simulates the solar eclipse.

Three major Mexican cities where you can see the total solar eclipse are Mazatlán, Durango, and Torreón.

There are numerous locations across the US where you can potentially experience totality. A few of the locations include Dallas, Texas; Russellville, Arkansas; Carbondale, Illinois; Greenwood, Indiana; and Buffalo, New York.

Finding somewhere you can avoid a cloudy overcast is crucial if you want to have the best viewing experience. ""Particularly in northern New England, we can have colder, cloudy weather,"" says Petro. ""Through Mexico and Central Texas, you might be able to find places that are more likely to get clear skies.""

Want to travel somewhere within the path of totality? You might have to get creative at this point, since many hotels and campgrounds within the core path have been fully booked for months. Maybe consider finding a place to stay overnight that's an hour or so outside of the main route and drive in for the afternoon to see the solar eclipse.

The answer is yes.

""Looking at any amount of sun is really dangerous,"" says Matt Bothwell, a public astronomer at Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy.

Mother Dairy will launch this summer 30 new products, mainly in ice cream and yoghurt categories, as it expects a 25-30 per cent increase in consumer demand, a top company official said.

Mother Dairy, a leading milk supplier in Delhi-NCR, has nine company-owned dairy processing plants with a total capacity of more than 50 lakh litres per day.

In an interview with PTI, Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd MD Manish Bandlish said, ""Summer is the most anticipated season for our business, especially for categories like ice creams, curd and beverages"".

""With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multifold surge in demand for these categories,"" he added.

Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year.

The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to Rs 50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

""As we get into the season, we are all geared up to excite consumers in our golden jubilee year with an array of over 30 new delightful products. The upcoming range will feature around 20 new ice cream products, followed by Greek yoghurts and other dairy products,"" Bandlish said.

Overall, he said the company is very optimistic about the season.

""We expect the demand towards our dairy products to strengthen by 25-30 per cent over the last season's demand,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy has also announced its expansion plan for dairy and fruits and vegetables (F&V) businesses.

The company will invest Rs 650 crore to set up two new plants for processing milk and fruits and vegetables.

It will also invest another Rs 100 crore to expand the capacities of its existing plants, taking the total capex to Rs 750 crore.

""In our endeavour to expand our distribution and reach to our consumers, we have earmarked a capital expenditure (capex) outlay of over Rs 750 crore to enhance our dairy and F&V processing capacities across key locations,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy is coming up with a big dairy plant in Nagpur with an investment of around Rs 525 crore.

The greenfield plant will have a processing capacity of 6 lakh litres of milk per day.

""We also plan to commission a new fruit processing plant in Karnataka with an investment of over Rs 125 crore under our Safal brand,"" Bandlish said.

These two plants are likely to be completed in about two years.

For the horticulture (fruits and vegetables) segment, the company has its own four plants, while for edible oils it manufactures through 15 associated plants.

Mother Dairy's turnover in 2022-23 stood at around Rs 14,500 crore.

On the expected turnover for this fiscal, Bandlish said, ""Despite a challenging year and subdued summer season last year, deflation in the edible oil sector, the company is likely to exit 2023-24 with a moderate growth rate of around 7-8 per cent in volume terms"".

Mother Dairy was commissioned in 1974. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

Mother Dairy was established under the initiative of 'Operation Flood', the world's biggest dairy development programme, launched to make India a milk-sufficient nation.

Locals demand protection...,"SRINAGAR, India (AP) - Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people´s lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh´s thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region´s militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region´s shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing´s land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region´s representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy´,"" Wangchuk recently posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh & continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""

Seoul: The fourth unit of the South Korea-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, South Korea's state-run utility company said on Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

The wind power project, located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from capital Dhaka, is invested by Wuling Power Corp., a subsidiary of China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC), and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp..

Upon full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households.

Md. Abdul Kader Goni, the executive engineer of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told Xinhua that Bangladesh entered the era of first commercial wind power with the establishment of the wind power plant at Cox's Bazar.

Hei Zhao, general manager of Bangladesh division of Wuling Power Corp., said this is the first time that Chinese enterprises have introduced wind power into Bangladesh as investors, filling the gap in the wind power field in Bangladesh.

""During the construction of the project, we used Chinese solutions, Chinese standards and Chinese equipment to promote the sustainable development of Bangladesh's renewable energy industry, while training the first batch of practical talents in the field of wind power for Bangladesh and providing more than 1,500 local jobs,"" he added.

During a working visit to various power projects in Lagos on Friday, Mr Adelabu said the aim was to enhance power supply across the country to meet the growing energy demands.

His visit included an inspection of the headquarters of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) and two 20 MVA injection substations at Randle, Surulere, along with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) monitoring rooms.

Mr Adelabu emphasised the urgency of boosting electricity generation capacity, stating, ""3,500 megawatts is not acceptable, and we have plans to increase the capacity to a minimum of 6,000 to 6,500 within the next three to six months.""

He commended EKEDC for its achievements over the past decade and stressed the need for continuous improvement in the power sector to drive economic growth and development effectively. Highlighting the critical role of the power sector in industrial and economic development, Mr Adelabu compared Nigeria's power generation capacity unfavourably to that of countries like Korea and China, underscoring the need for substantial improvement.

Addressing challenges in the power sector, Mr Adelabu emphasised the importance of prioritising baseload power generation and gradually transitioning to cleaner energy sources to meet the nation's energy needs effectively.

He acknowledged the persisting complaints about power outages and urged stakeholders to work collaboratively to address these challenges and improve service delivery.

Mr Adelabu outlined the government's strategy to prioritise service provision to customers in higher billing bands while gradually extending improved services to all segments through strategic infrastructure investments.

Recognising the role of Distribution Companies (DisCos) in customer service, Mr Adelabu said it was important to ensure proactive engagement and efficient operations at this level to address consumer needs effectively.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that he stressed the need for comprehensive reforms and transformation in all segments of the power sector, focusing on issues such as metering, vandalism, debt collection, and customer relations.

Mr Adelabu highlighted the necessity of stimulating demand through customer engagement to ensure effective utilisation of generated power and underscored the importance of efficient distribution to prevent wastage.

The minister noted the government's commitment to enhancing the sector's performance through substantial investments in infrastructure and efficient customer response.

In response to the minister's visit, Oritsedere Otubu, chairman of EKEDC, commended the government's efforts to improve power supply and expressed the company's commitment to supporting the initiative.

Tinuade Sanda, CEO of EKEDC, said the company would continue to collaborate with government agencies and consumers to protect power assets and curb vandalism within its operations.

Mrs Sanda said that the company, in the last six months, had invested over four billion naira on transformers, cables and rehabilitation over 352 feeders to ensure stable supply during the rainy season.

She added that the debt profile of the company in the last 10 years stood at over N131 billion, inclusive of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).

""We also use this medium to appeal to our customers to pay their bills for effective service delivery.

""The MDAs outstanding debts to date stood at over N36 billion, adding that the DisCo will not hesitate to embark on mass disconnection of debtors,"" she added.

The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Sunday hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann over the deaths of 21 people due to the consumption of spurious liquor. Briefing media in New Delhi, Mr Thakur said, in the state where so many people lost their lives, the Chief Minister of that state is in Delhi and didn't utter a word about the incident, nor initiate an investigation. He said, that to fight for the jailed accused in the Excise Policy case Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and now Arvind Kejriwal, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has reached Delhi, but when 21 people in his constituency died after consuming illicit liquor, his government is protecting liquor traders. Mr Thakur asked people of the country never approve the sleeping Punjab government and the Delhi government running from jail.

Hitting out at the INDI Alliance over Tamil Nadu Minister Anitha Radhakrishnan's objectionable remarks on PM Modi, Mr Thakur said, the people of the alliance have lost their sanity. He said, such an instance is absolutely unforgivable as democracy doesn't have any space and scope for such a cheap thing.

The leaders said the six, who were already stripped of their assembly membership, hatched a conspiracy with the BJP to topple the democratically elected government.

The three independents were Ashish Sharma, Hoshiyar Singh, and K L Thakur from Hamirpur, Dehra, and Nalagarh assembly seats.

The six former Congress MLAs -- Sudhir Sharma (Dharamshala), Ravi Thakur (Lahaul and Spiti), Rajinder Rana (Sujanpur), Inder Dutt Lakhanpal (Barsar), Chetanya Sharma (Gagret), and Devinder Kumar Bhutto (Kutlehar) - were disqualified by the speaker for defying a whip to be present in the house and vote in favour of the government during the cut motions and passing of the financial bill (budget).

The ministers said the leaders who won the election on Congress's symbol and honoured with various posts are now raising fingers at the party.

""The truth is that all these rebels have left the Congress party due to personal interests and it has nothing to do with the interest of the people of the state,"" they said.

Color grading is a vital aspect of video editing, allowing creators to enhance the visual appeal and storytelling of their content. While traditional color grading methods involve manual adjustments within editing software, there's a powerful alternative available: color grading plugins. These plugins offer a wide range of features and effects that can streamline the color grading process and unlock new creative possibilities. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the benefits of harnessing the power of color grading plugins and how they can help you master the art of video editing.

Understanding Color Grading Plugins:

Color grading plugins are software extensions designed to work seamlessly within popular video editing platforms such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Final Cut Pro. These plugins offer a diverse array of tools and effects specifically tailored for color grading tasks, allowing editors to achieve professional-quality results with ease. From advanced color correction algorithms to creative presets and stylized looks, color grading plugins provide a convenient and efficient way to enhance the visual appeal of your videos.

Streamlining the Color Grading Process:

One of the primary benefits of using color grading plugins is their ability to streamline the color grading process. Instead of manually adjusting individual parameters within your editing software, plugins offer intuitive interfaces and preset options that simplify the workflow. With just a few clicks, you can apply complex color grading effects, adjust color curves, and fine-tune saturation levels, saving time and effort while achieving consistent and high-quality results. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a novice editor, color grading plugins can help you work more efficiently and effectively.

Access to Advanced Tools and Effects:

Another advantage of color grading plugins is their access to advanced tools and effects that may not be available natively within your editing software. Plugins often include features such as advanced color correction algorithms, GPU acceleration, and real-time preview capabilities, allowing for faster and more precise color grading. Additionally, many plugins offer a wide range of creative presets and stylized looks inspired by cinematic trends, vintage film stocks, and artistic aesthetics. By leveraging these advanced tools and effects, you can elevate the visual quality of your videos and achieve professional-grade results with ease.

Flexibility and Customization:

Color grading plugins offer a high degree of flexibility and customization, allowing you to tailor your color grading workflow to suit your specific needs and preferences. Whether you prefer a hands-on approach with manual adjustments or prefer to use pre-built presets and templates, plugins offer a wide range of options to accommodate your workflow. Many plugins also allow for custom presets and effects, enabling you to create and save your own signature looks for future projects. This flexibility and customization ensure that you have full control over the final look and feel of your videos, allowing for endless creative possibilities.

Compatibility and Integration:

Color grading plugins are designed to seamlessly integrate with popular video editing software, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for editors of all skill levels. Whether you're working in Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut Pro, you can easily install and use color grading plugins to enhance your editing workflow. Additionally, many plugins offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to use the same plugins across different editing software and operating systems. This compatibility and integration make color grading plugins a versatile and valuable addition to any editor's toolkit.

Popular Color Grading Plugins to Consider:

There are several popular color grading plugins available on the market, each offering unique features and capabilities to enhance your video editing workflow. Some of the most notable plugins include:

Magic Bullet Looks:

Known for its intuitive interface and extensive library of presets, Magic Bullet Looks offers a wide range of color grading tools and effects to enhance your videos.

On Tuesday, April 2, at 7:20 p.m., DEMA, Delaware State Police and the Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. will conduct a quarterly test of the Alert and Notification system for the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations in Salem County, New Jersey.

During the test, which is done to monitor the integrity of the siren system, sirens will be activated for three to five minutes, followed by a test message of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on local radio stations, according to Delaware.gov.

There are 37 sirens in Delaware located within a 10-mile radius of the nuclear-generating stations. These sirens cover an area north from Delaware City, west to Middletown and south to Woodland beach.

During an actual emergency, the sirens would produce a series of steady three- to five-minute siren sounds that would alert residents to turn their radio to an EAS station for emergency instructions and information, according to Delaware.gov.

For more information about the test, call DEMA at 1-877-SAY-DEMA (1-877-729-3362) or (302) 659-3362 and ask for Georgina Harris-Sharper or Albert Samah.

Free potassium iodide (KI) tablets will be distributed to those who live or work within a 10-mile radius of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations in Salem County, New Jersey, also known as the Emergency Planning Zone.

The effort is a partnership between DEMA and the Delaware Division of Public Health. The free tablet distribution will take place on Thursday, April 4, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Townsend Fire Company at the Volunteer Hose Co. Of Middletown at 27 West Green Street in Middletown.

KI tablets are available to residents who have received them in the past and whose tablets have reached their expiration date, as well as those who never received tablets before, according to Delaware.gov.

Residents with home or business addresses within the EPZ are eligible to receive KI tablets. To do so, recipients must bring a photo ID such as a driver's license, proof of residency such as a utility bill or proof of employment within the EPZ when they go to the pickup location.

If you have expired KI tablets, you can bring those to the distribution center to exchange them for new ones.

The 10-mile EPZ in Delaware is comprised of four Emergency Response Planning Areas:

To check whether you are within the EPZ, visit de.gov/epz.

KI does not protect against external radiation, but it can help protect the thyroid gland from ingested or inhaled radioactive iodine that could be released in a radiation emergency. The tablet is one of the protective measures outlined in Delaware's emergency plans developed for use in a nuclear incident and is provided through a program from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Delaware.gov.

If you live outside of the 10-mile EPZ and would like to get KI tablets, you can contact your pharmacist. KI tablets are also available over the counter at some local pharmacies.

For more information about the KI tablet distribution program, call DEMA Radiological Emergency Preparedness at (302) 659-3362 or visit PrepareDE.org.

Ahmednasir ropes AG in stand-off with Supreme Court; seeks Sh200m damages

The stand-off between Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi and the Supreme Court is still on and this week, the lawyer roped in the Attorney General.

He moved to the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) seeking Sh200 million in damages over the ban to appear before the apex court.

In his petition, Ahmednasir wants the EACJ to issue an order directing AG Justin Muturi to reverse the pronouncement made by the Supreme Court that barred him from appearing before it.

Ahmednassir says the Sh200 million damages he is seeking are fees that he lost for cases he had conducted before the Supreme Court.

In January this year, the Apex court in a letter by Registrar Letizia Wachira barred Ahmednasir and employees of his law firm from filing cases before it over what it termed as incessant attacks.

""In view of the foregoing, it is the decision of this court, that henceforth and from the date of this communication, you shall have no audience before the Court, either by yourself, through an employee of your law firm, or any other person holding brief for you,"" the statement read in part.

It is this decision that the SC is challenging at the Arusha-based court.

City Lawyer to part with Sh25.9m in Cemetery Scandal

The Milimani Anti-Corruption Court ordered a city lawyer to pay back Sh25.9 million he is said to have obtained following the fraudulent sale of land.

Judge Esther Maina also ordered him to pay the costs of the suit to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and interest at court rates from 2009, when he received it.

EACC had sued City Lawyer Alphonce Munene Mutinda for fraudulently selling the land intended to be used as a public cemetery, to the City Council for Sh283.2 million.

It said he represented the land's purported vendor as his lawyer despite knowing that his client did not bid or participate in the tender with the Council.

It added that he had received the money as payment knowing that he was not entitled to the same.

""Among other recipients of the funds aforesaid was the defendant (Mutunga) who was paid the sum of Sh25.9 million over and above his legal fees as the lawyer acting for the purported vendor in the said fraudulent transaction,"" the court was told.

Justice Sifuna declines to recuse himself from Tanui case

A month, after he made a precedent on the withdrawal of cases by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Justice Nixon Sifuna, declined to bow out the case.

He refused to recuse himself from hearing an application filed by the ODPP that seeks to review orders blocking it from withdrawing the Sh30 million graft case facing former Kenya Pipeline Company boss Charles Tanui and two others.

In his ruling on Thursday, the Milimani Law Courts Judge said issues of bias on the court must be reasonable and not speculative.

""A judicial officer presiding in a case will have no difficulty recusing himself where he knows or it is sufficiently demonstrated that he is biased, likely to be biased or unlikely to be impartial,"" Sifuna said.

The DPP was opposed to the matter being handled by the Judge claiming he previously dismissed a similar application arising from the same criminal case.

The DPP was also opposed to the Judge handling the case because of the numerous times he has pronounced himself regarding their practice of withdrawing cases in court.

Former PC Chelogoi detained in Sh1.35 billion land case

On Thursday, the Milimani Chief Magistrates Court detained former PC Davis Chelogo in Sh1.35bn land case.

Chelogoi had previously failed to honour court summons, despite four previous warrants of arrest being issued against him.

The court had directed him to appear before it on Thursday morning for plea-taking but failed to show up.

Principal magistrate Dolphina Alego issued another arrest warrant before Chelogoi finally appeared in court.

He pleaded not guilty to six counts of fraud, conspiracy to defraud and forgery.

His lawyer Tom Ojienda requested for lenient bond terms saying Chelogoi was not a flight risk.

This was however opposed by the state as did lawyers representing the complainant Ashok Shah who claims his land was forcefully taken away.

The ruling on the former PC's bond application will be issued on Monday.

Court rules law limiting freedom of speech unconstitutional

The High Court in Nakuru has declared Section 77 (1) and (3) of the Penal Code unconstitutional.

Delivering the judgment on Monday, Justice Samwel Muhochi said the section is over-broad and vague adding that it limits the right to freedom of expression without clarity as to the purpose and intent.

""A Declaration is hereby issued that, section 77 (1) and (3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the Penal Code, Cap 63 is unconstitutional,"" he ruled.

Justice Muhochi added that the enforcement of the Section and its provision against any member of the public is unconstitutional.

The judgment stemmed from a petition filed before the court by the Katiba Institute, Law Society of Kenya, ICJ, Bloggers Association, KUJ, and KHRC among others.

They argued that Section 77 of the Penal Code had no place in a modern democratic state like Kenya, saying that it is of a colonial legacy that limits freedom of expression through the vaguely worded offence of ""subversion"".

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

Despite initial doubts about intent, the foul was upgraded following a review at the scorer's table, prompted by Clark hitting the floor and clutching her face. One fan expressed their interpretation of the incident on X:

""That was NOT an intentional foul on Bronagh Power-Cassidy. Was definitely a foul, but she certainly was trying to take out Caitlin Clark with an elbow right there!""

Here is how fans are reacting to this incident:

Clark, a remarkable 85% free throw shooter in her career, capitalized on the foul, sinking both free throws to extend the Hawkeyes' lead to seven in the second quarter.

As the NCAA's all-time leading scorer, Clark is determined to lead the Hawkeyes to their second-consecutive Final Four appearance, propelled by her outstanding performance. Last season, Iowa defeated South Carolina in the national semifinal, igniting hopes for another deep tournament run.

Clark's dominance was evident in her statement after a recent victory over Nebraska, where she scored 30 points in the second half and overtime. She emphasized the intensity of NCAA Tournament play, acknowledging its significance and the team's need for relentless preparation:

""If you don't have it for one night, your season's over in the blink of an eye.""

Iowa, now a top seed after three decades, hosted the first and second rounds at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City. With Clark's stellar performances captivating audiences, there's anticipation for a potential showdown with top-seeded South Carolina in the national championship game, should both teams progress. The Gamecocks secured their opening-round victory against Presbyterian.

Caitlin Clark leads Iowa's comeback against Holy Cross

In a surprising turn of events, top-seeded Iowa found themselves locked in a tense battle against the underdog 16th-seeded Holy Cross during the first quarter of their matchup.

Caitlin Clark initially struggled to find her rhythm, managing just a solitary field goal and accumulating five turnovers. Despite Clark's early woes, Holy Cross capitalized on Iowa's mistakes, converting turnovers into crucial points, keeping the scoreline close at 23-21 in Iowa's favor by the end of the quarter.

Iowa struggled initially but adapte­d by dominating Holy Cross 25-9 in Q2, capturing a commanding 48-30 halftime lead. Clark, despite­ poor shooting, contributed 13 points, dished seven assists and grabbed five boards be­fore halftime.

Virginia is accepting applications for the Infrastructure Grant funding through April 15.

""This partnership between USDA and Virginia is allowing critical funding to reach areas of the supply chain that need it most,"" said USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs Under Secretary Jenny Lester Moffitt. ""The projects funded through this program will create new opportunities for the region's small and midsize producers to thrive, expand access to nutritious food options, and increase supply chain resiliency.""

In May, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the availability of up to $420 million through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) authorized by the American Rescue Plan to strengthen local and regional food systems, it said.

Through this program, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has entered into cooperative agreements with state agencies, commissions, or departments responsible for agriculture, commercial food processing, seafood, or food system and distribution activities or commerce activities in states or U.S. territories.

Using RFSI funding, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) will fund projects that increase cold storage and flash freezing facilities, provide more transportation options, modernize equipment for value-added processing, and expand capacity for aggregation, according to the USDA.

""There are approximately 41,500 farm operations in the Commonwealth with the vast majority of these being family owned. To help local and regional farms and food businesses achieve scale and efficiencies, we must invest in supply chain infrastructure and help facilitate market access,"" said Joseph Guthrie, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Those interested in receiving a sub-award should apply directly through VDACS by April 15. AMS encourages applications that serve smaller farms and ranches, new and beginning farmers and ranchers, underserved producers, veteran producers, and underserved communities.

Through the program and in addition to the Infrastructure Grant funding, VDACS will support supply chain coordination and technical assistance to farmers and food businesses operating in processing, aggregation and distribution, USDA said.

""With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multifold surge in demand for these categories,"" he added. Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year. The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to Rs 50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

The designer, whose work offered women respite from the limits of the male gaze, has never been all that interested in explaining herself.

""I say most of what I feel, and most of what is worth me saying, through what I make,"" she offered recently.

Although she became famous for transforming both Chloe and Celine, she walked away from the industry almost seven years ago and pretty much dropped out of sight.

When she returned, late last year, under her own name, she did so to sky-high expectations and with a succinct, online-only offering of practical pieces for complicated characters who are unapologetic about their idiosyncrasies and inner lives.

Quite a lot like ""Phoebe"" herself, as she is generally referred to even by people who don't know her, in part because her clothes make them think they know her (or she knows them, or at least knows what they want).

It's both her superpower and her curse.

Critics and fashion insiders generally loved her new collection. It almost sold out in hours. And then the complaining began.

It was too expensive - the average bag price is around US$5,000 (approximately RM23,700); the top end of the collection includes coats for US$25,000 (RM118,500).

It wasn't surprising. You couldn't try anything on, and the return policy was impossible.

""I had the absolute worst customer experience,"" said Alexandra Van Houtte, the founder of fashion search engine Tagwalk and a Philo fan, who bought a dress on the day the brand appeared.

Which may be why, as the second delivery arrives and what Phoebe Philo-the-brand is really about comes further into focus, Phoebe Philo-the-designer has decided it is time to... well, not exactly explain herself. But at least open up a little.

""I don't feel that there's a huge amount of storytelling that needs to be done,"" said Philo, 50.

The subject was Philo's reluctance to talk: about her work, her plans, herself.

""I'm not particularly into that,"" she went on.

""I don't feel myself that I need a lot of that from other fashion houses. I feel that it's just not necessary. To a certain extent, you either like it or you don't. Someone telling me a story isn't going to make me like it more. It is a coat. It's a pair of trousers. I do appreciate a level of straightforwardness.""

Although famously fine-boned and fragile, she can be immovable when she wants.

It's tempting to see her tendency to lean on jargony words like ""processing"" and ""learnings"", and her refusal to engage with the usual dance of publicity, as deliberately obstructive, except that her close friends say that this is characteristic of how she interacts with the world.

""I've gotten used to how she communicates,"" said Bella Freud, a designer who has known Philo since she was at Chloe.

""We rarely talk about fashion. More about thoughts, things to do with confidence, authenticity. It's almost like she's exploring a philosophy. I quite like the abstractness of it and not demanding to know what she means.""

Peter Miles, who worked with Philo for 10 years at Celine, and helped create the identity for the Phoebe Philo brand, agreed.

""She has never wanted to give people what they want,"" he said.

""Or, rather, she does want to please but not in the way you expect to be pleased.""

When pushed about the groundswell of anticipation and fantasy surrounding her return, Philo sighed and stared at the wall.

""There may have been an expectation that I could have provided everything to everyone immediately,"" she finally said.

""And that's just not possible. It takes time and effort to make most things that have meaning. One has to stand for something.""

This is how Philo describes her own work, which involves loose jeans that unzip to the rear in the back, cave man trousers and coats covered in shaggy embroidery, high-collar almost military trenches and a pillowy silk ""scarf"" that looks like a cross between a giant padded doughnut and a neck brace.

""It's very intuitive,"" she said of her work.

""A response to what I see around me, how I see women dressing, how I feel myself, my relationship with clothes.""

Philo views her work as one continuous collection and does not believe in seasons. She prefers the word ""edit"" and divides those edits into ""deliveries"".

Delivery 1 of Edit 2 is on sale now, and Delivery 2 is planned to arrive at the end of March.

When the terminology was first introduced, along with the statement that the brand intentionally made less than the anticipated demand, it was widely misinterpreted as a strategy calculated to drum up extreme consumer FOMO, or fear of missing out.

Philo said that was not her aim. The point was to create a baseline of data to help her figure out how much she would need to produce to satisfy her market without ending up with lots of stuff to liquidate - and to encourage customers to build a coherent wardrobe slowly, over time.

That's why customers were asked to sign up via email to be alerted about deliveries.

For all her talk about not paying attention to the outside noise around her business, Philo knows some things have to change.

They are working on smoothing out the returns policy, offering more ways to pay and alerting subscribers when a piece they like is back in stock. As the collections get fuller, there will be a greater range of prices, with some jersey pieces that are (relatively) more affordable.

Although she isn't apologising for the prices.

""The intention, really, is that the pieces stick around for a while,"" Philo said. ""They have to be made well, and they have to be considered. And that tends to come at a price point.""

By summer, she hopes to open some sort of physical space - maybe temporary, maybe not - first in New York, then in London.

There may even be a show, in time.

But right now and, she said, ""In today's world, where there's so much fashion, and so much big fashion, I try to remember that most of the big houses started with one human being who had an idea about what they wanted to do."" - The New York Times",thestar.com.my,news,The Star ,,0.1215686274509804,448968942,1,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/03/20/2601995.jpg,

The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

If Nvidia is the king of AI, Arm Holdings is arguably the queen.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.

Very soon, on Monday, April 8, there will be a solar eclipse that will be visible to the people of the United States. They will observe a halo of light around the dark disk of the Moon as the Earth, the Sun, and our satellite line up.

The eclipse will be visible from several angles: from the Earth and directly from the Moon. Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at the University of Michigan, explained what this phenomenon might look like for astronauts.

If you were an astronaut who landed on the night side of the Moon, you would be able to see a solar eclipse from the outside.

What a solar eclipse looks like from the Moon

The inhabitants of the satellite would see a circular shadow moving across the Earth's surface at a speed of about 2,400 kilometers per hour.

On Monday, April 8, it will first appear in the Pacific Ocean, then make landfall in Mazatlan, and then move diagonally across Texas to Maine and off the coast of Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean to disappear. This path is called the path of totality.

Solar eclipse on the Moon

Surprisingly enough, solar eclipses also occur on the Moon, but they look completely different from those on Earth. In particular, because the Sun is hiding not behind the Moon but behind the Earth.

Our planet, which is much larger than the Moon, casts a shadow on the satellite in a special way. This was explained by astrophysicist and doctoral candidate Alfredo Carpineti

The shadow of the Earth is divided into a total shadow and a penumbral shadow. A partial eclipse will occur soon. From the late evening of Sunday, March 24, to the early hours of Monday, the full Moon will be visible from Earth as it loses its luster.

Astronauts, if they were on a satellite at the time, would be able to see either a total or a partial eclipse, depending on their location.

However, when a total eclipse occurs on the Moon, the event is spectacular. All sunlight coming directly from the Sun is blocked, but the shadow cast by the Earth is not completely black. As the sunlight is scattered in the atmosphere, it takes on a red tint, causing the Moon's silvery surface to glow this color.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,0.1137254901960785,448968859,1,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/3/24/d32483fc-6ef5-4060-b069-bb66d0ea3481.png?size=2010x1050,spa-3423064

The party's remarks came in the wake of nine MLAs - six Congress rebels and three independents -, who had voted in favour of the BJP nominee Harsh Mahajan in the Rajya Sabha elections on February 27, joining the BJP in Delhi on Friday.

''The strategy, face, and character of the BJP has been exposed in front of the public as Congress rebels joining BJP have made it clear that the BJP was behind the whole conspiracy,'' Health Minister Dhani Ram Shandil and Industries Minister Harsh Vardhan Chauhan said in a joint statement here.

The leaders said the six, who were already stripped of their assembly membership, hatched a conspiracy with the BJP to topple the democratically elected government.

The three independents were Ashish Sharma, Hoshiyar Singh, and K L Thakur from Hamirpur, Dehra, and Nalagarh assembly seats.

The six former Congress MLAs -- Sudhir Sharma (Dharamshala), Ravi Thakur (Lahaul and Spiti), Rajinder Rana (Sujanpur), Inder Dutt Lakhanpal (Barsar), Chetanya Sharma (Gagret), and Devinder Kumar Bhutto (Kutlehar) - were disqualified by the speaker for defying a whip to be present in the house and vote in favour of the government during the cut motions and passing of the financial bill (budget).

The ministers said the leaders who won the election on Congress's symbol and honoured with various posts are now raising fingers at the party.

''The truth is that all these rebels have left the Congress party due to personal interests and it has nothing to do with the interest of the people of the state,'' they said.

With the disqualification of six Congress MLAs, the strength of the ruling Congress came down from 40 to 34, including the Speaker who can vote only in the case of a tie during a floor test, in the 68-member Assembly. The BJP has 25 members.

Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Wangchuk recently posted on X, formerly Twitter.

Locals demand protection of fragile ecology, land autonomy","SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

During a total solar eclipse, the moon appears to completely cover the sun, casting its shadow along its trajectory above the Earth. This year's eclipse will be the second of its kind in the 21st century to touch the contiguous U.S. There won't be another one until 2044.

Experts say anyone in northern Mexico, parts of Canada, or one of 15 U.S. states from which the eclipse can be seen on April 8 should also prepare.

Ordinary sunglasses won't do that day. Anyone looking up to the sky should wear a pair of safe solar viewing glasses to protect from the sun's ultraviolet radiation and infrared light, which can cause serious injury to vision and possibly blindness. Even a glance at the sun can be risky.

Even though most people in the U.S. will be able to see at least a partial solar eclipse that day, only those in the 115-mile-wide (185.07-kilometer-wide) path of totality - right under the moon's shadow - will be able to take their glasses off for approximately four minutes briefly.

For specialists, safety is at the top of their minds. But understanding how the eyes absorb light and perceive color can help viewers enjoy a short-lived, possibly once-in-a-lifetime, stargazing event.

The eye will notice light dimming five to 10 minutes before the eclipse's totality. Two minutes before the main event, red colors will fade and contrast with greens and blues in a biological phenomenon called the Purkinje effect.

Normally, as day transitions into night, the eyes adjust to the dark as rod cells become more active than cone cells. This period, called dark adaptation, can take anywhere between 30 minutes and two hours.

So the retina takes a while to adjust to the quick change. This part of the eye has two types of photosensitive cells that convert light into signals sent to the brain that allow humans to see the world. Cones are the receptors responsible for colorful vision in the daytime. Rods are the receptors that work in low-light conditions and allow for nighttime vision.

This effect, named after the Czech physiologist who discovered it, occurs as cones struggle to absorb light under the moon's shadow and rods activate nighttime vision. This desaturates the colors the human eye perceives, decreasing the reds, slightly increasing the greens and blues and creating a gray hue.

Those who want to look at the sun as the moon partially or completely obscures it should secure a pair of safe solar glasses in advance. But eclipse viewers should also keep other things in mind, especially if they have eye conditions.

Often associated with eclipse viewing is a serious injury to the eye's retina that can cause temporary or permanent blurry vision from just a few seconds of looking at the sun. Those at higher risk for this retinal burn, called solar retinopathy, include people taking medication like tetracycline for acne or rosacea.

On the flip side, Bajic said those with a history of cataracts might be less sensitive to the sun because their cloudy vision would technically act as a filter. But that's not to say they shouldn't take the additional and necessary step of protecting their eyesight with viewing glasses.

Those who prefer not to venture a peek can get creative with the easy pinhole projection method, which works best during a partial eclipse or when a total solar eclipse has yet to reach totality.

When sunlight passes through small holes -punched in an index card or cardboard box, on a pasta colander or straw hat, or through outstretched fingers on crossed hands - and lands on a flat surface, it projects the sun's crescent shape in a grid pattern. Spaces between tree leaves can also create pinhole projections.

Importantly, this method of indirect viewing does not entail spectators looking directly at the sun through these holes but rather at its projections as they face away from the star. An Adler Planetarium blog post at adlerplanetarium.org/blog offers instructions on making a projector with a cardboard box.",dailysabah.com,news,Daily Sabah,Deutsche Presse-Agentur,0.223529411764706,448968614,1,https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/800x531/320836.jpg,eng-9413446

The party's remarks came in the wake of nine MLAs - six Congress rebels and three independents -, who had voted in favour of the BJP nominee Harsh Mahajan in the Rajya Sabha elections on February 27, joining the BJP in Delhi on Friday.

""The strategy, face, and character of the BJP has been exposed in front of the public as Congress rebels joining BJP have made it clear that the BJP was behind the whole conspiracy,"" Health Minister Dhani Ram Shandil and Industries Minister Harsh Vardhan Chauhan said in a joint statement here.

The leaders said the six, who were already stripped of their assembly membership, hatched a conspiracy with the BJP to topple the democratically elected government.

The three independents were Ashish Sharma, Hoshiyar Singh, and K L Thakur from Hamirpur, Dehra, and Nalagarh assembly seats.

The six former Congress MLAs -- Sudhir Sharma (Dharamshala), Ravi Thakur (Lahaul and Spiti), Rajinder Rana (Sujanpur), Inder Dutt Lakhanpal (Barsar), Chetanya Sharma (Gagret), and Devinder Kumar Bhutto (Kutlehar) - were disqualified by the speaker for defying a whip to be present in the house and vote in favour of the government during the cut motions and passing of the financial bill (budget).

The ministers said the leaders who won the election on Congress's symbol and honoured with various posts are now raising fingers at the party.

""The truth is that all these rebels have left the Congress party due to personal interests and it has nothing to do with the interest of the people of the state,"" they said.

With the disqualification of six Congress MLAs, the strength of the ruling Congress came down from 40 to 34, including the Speaker who can vote only in the case of a tie during a floor test, in the 68-member Assembly.

These individuals, once wielders of influence and authority, find themselves relegated to the sidelines of society's collective memory once their time in the spotlight fades. This essay explores the fallacy of power, politics, and fame in Nigeria, emphasizing the transient nature of these constructs and the tendency of Nigerian politicians to fade into obscurity once they lose their grip on power.

Power, in its various manifestations, is often perceived as the ultimate prize in Nigeria's political arena.

Let me explain briefly and with a smile...I say if you don't know you can know. In Nigeria, a governor is entitled to some mysterious humongous amount of money called security votes, sadly in most states no one is secure.

That same governor amongst the humble ones are those that are privileged to have at least 20 advisors, some have been known to have as much as 500 advisors with designation ranging from Special Advisers to Senior Special Advisers, this is for offices that have commissioners already, and in cases also personal assistants and advisers.

I have excluded the retinue of security aparachik, the Nigerian politician while in office does not do any work, and pays literally for nothing. I am not discussing the cost of governance but the opulence of governance.

Politicians invest significant resources and effort into acquiring and maintaining power, viewing it as a means to attain wealth, prestige, and influence. However, the reality is that power is ephemeral, subject to the whims of electoral cycles, shifting political alliances, and the unpredictable tides of public opinion.

Nigerian history is replete with examples of once-powerful politicians who have fallen from grace, their names consigned to the annals of history as mere footnotes in the country's political narrative. I will come back to this before I drop my pen!

Politics, too, is characterized by its transient nature in Nigeria. The pursuit of political office is often driven by personal ambition rather than a genuine desire to serve the public good. Nigerian politicians engage in cutthroat tactics to ascend the political ladder, forming alliances of convenience and betraying erstwhile allies to achieve their goals.

The AD-PDP-ANPP-CPC-AA-APC phenomenon where a politician has belonged to all these political parties in barely two decades of power.

However, once in power, many politicians prioritize self-interest over the welfare of the people, using their positions to amass wealth and consolidate their grip on power. Consequently, when their tenure ends, they are swiftly cast aside by the electorate, their promises forgotten and their legacies tarnished by allegations of corruption and malfeasance.

Similarly, fame in Nigeria's political arena is fleeting. Politicians bask in the adulation of the masses during their time in office, enjoying the trappings of power and the privileges afforded to them by their positions.

However, once their tenure ends, they find themselves relegated to the margins of society, their once-glittering reputations tarnished by scandals and controversies. The Nigerian public, ever fickle in its affections, quickly moves on to the next political sensation, consigning yesterday's heroes to the dustbin of history.

So, do we remember that governor that fought with his deputy, finally impeaching him for owning a poultry, I mean it, for owning a poultry. How about that governor that became a governor because the owner of the seat went on to become a Vice President that has been trying every electoral circle to get the big prize. The last I heard of him, he was the leader of the Association of Former PDP Ex-Governors.

There is another one I know, in fact a woman, and trust me in Nigeria forget all that noise of gender equality, I tell you, our women have not done badly, I know that was a councillor in the 70s, Commissioner in the 80s, Minister in the 90s, 20s, and even doubled as a deputy governor, and was still a minister a year ago. I don't recall where she is now.

There is one, a big masquerade, he was all over the place, he always gifted you a statue of yourself if he was pleased with you, his home-state has been unfortunate in governance, from a palm wine tapper to the current one lovingly called in the past, the Supreme Court Governor.

There was this other one in a state in the North, at some point he was in the Senate, and his wife was equally in the House of Rep, he had been governor, and at some point the wife was a minister of state for foreign affairs.

This is just a little click of a mouse between ""me and my family group of big political office holders"", a conglomerate of father in power, wife in power, and family members in power simultaneously.

They come with all kinds of slogans from engineering to re-engineering, redemption, to redeemer, they had their caps like the kwankwansia, in all colours but they all faded with time, in many cases no legacy.

I was talking the other day about Mallam Kachalla, and someone asked me who he was...the one-time governor of Borno, now a man from yesterday.

Another was and is the man who was popularly called SAS, he was party chairmen of two different parties, and has belonged to four at my last count. These days a whole six months and no mention of his name in the papers.

Where is Adamu Mauzu...where is Bode George, I am not sure where our one time VP under Jonathan is, very nice man, but nowhere to be found, where is Rochas Okorocha, Achike Udenwa, what does Babagida Aliyu do these days, Boni Haruna, or Mimiko...I remember the most handsome governor in that class, that Cross River dude, very nice guy with his Saxophone. My friend who left his state better than he met it...

Where is Suswan, and these days one hardly hears from his successor Ortom... What does Imoke do, and even a handful of the most current of them are fading, where is the professor of big sounding budget names Ben Ayade, Rotimi Amaechi is now a Barrister, I hopefully will drop by his chambers one of these days.

My dear friends Isa Yuguda, Danjuma Goje, Hashidu, and Orji Theodore, and Ipeazu, are all silent these days, and indeed the silence is loud, extremely loud as their times are fading away. Life is in time and phases, whether minister, legislator, head of some important parastatal, slowly we forget you all...

In conclusion, Nigeria's forgotten men serve as a poignant reminder of the fallacy of power, politics, and fame in the country's socio-political landscape.

While politicians may wield considerable influence during their time in office, their power is transient, and their legacies ephemeral. The true measure of a leader lies not in the pomp and circumstance of political office but in the enduring impact they have on the lives of the people they serve.

As Nigeria continues its quest for democratic consolidation and socio-economic development, it is imperative that its leaders prioritize the public good over personal gain, lest they too be consigned to the ranks of the forgotten men -- May Nigeria win!",thewillnews.com,news,"THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News",,0.223529411764706,448968497,1,https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nigeria_physical_map.gif,

The agreement, with a term of nine years, ensures the continued production of desalinated water by SMN Barka Power's desalination plant.

This strategic partnership reinforces SMN Barka Power's role as a significant contributor to Oman's water sector.

The company's desalination plant possesses a production capacity of 26.4 million imperial gallons per day (MIGD), playing a vital role in fulfilling the nation's water requirements.

""The successful execution of this long-term WPA with Nama PWP represents a significant achievement for SMN Power,"" the company said in a statement.

Locals demand protection of fragile ecology, land autonomy","SRINAGAR, India -- Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a''climate fast.''

''We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers'' in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ''water towers of the world,'' are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.''

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

MMC for utilities and regional operations and co-ordination this week called on residents who want to feed excess energy back into the City's grid to come forward and register.

He informed those interested in feeding excess energy back into the City's grid about the mandatory registration on the City's database.

Fosi said: ""Residents who have installed embedded generation systems like solar photovoltaics, waste to energy, energy storage, petroleum generators and bidirectional electricity meters are welcome to feed excess electricity back into the City's grid.""

The process, he said, required approval from the City and can only be allowed for registered embedded generation customers with installed bidirectional meters.

""Unauthorised feed-in of electricity poses safety risks and potential legal liabilities,"" he said.

Fosi said the City was developing a crediting process for customers who want to feed excess energy into its grid.

""Electricity tariffs for consumption and reverse feed are reviewed annually and implemented at the beginning of each financial year on 1 July,"" he said.

Recently, Fosi said the City was working hard to reduce the impact of load shedding by going to the market to revive the operations of both the Rooiwal and Pretoria West power stations.

Locals demand protection of fragile ecology, land autonomy","SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Thousands of people in the remote region of Ladakh have been protesting for over two weeks in freezing temperatures, demanding constitutional provisions from the Indian government to protect their territory's fragile ecology and to have autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change. Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Top climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh. He has been on a fast, since the protests started on March 6, in the open in sub-zero temperatures and surviving only on salt and water.

Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers"" in the region, Wangchuk told The Associated Press Sunday.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers, which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world,"" are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military standoff between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in (the) making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment. The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood with local legislature to frame their own laws on land and agriculture. The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Wangchuk recently posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh & continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""",apnews.com,news,AP NEWS,,-0.2627450980392156,448968368,1,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/8dcf071/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+312/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ff4%2Fb6%2F2123fb364888e45b3e05426e3de5%2F1b4299e1ed6b4f03925da8db5daf666c,

Zulazrai, 36, who has been in the business for five years, said that the bamboo is sourced from Raub, Pahang, and to date he has met the demand of approximately 50 lemang vendors in Melaka, Negeri Sembilan as well as Muar, and Tangkak in Johor.

""Last year, we started selling it in the middle of Ramadan, but this year we started at the beginning. The demand is very high. We will stop taking orders about five days before Hari Raya Aidilfitri.

""So far there are orders for 37,000 bamboo stems. The highest order is for 10,000 stems. We also sell small quantities if needed,"" he told reporters at his business premises in Pokok Mangga here today.

A native of Melaka, Zulazrai said that the suppliers have delivered 20,000 stems so far, with the rest expected to be staggered into four deliveries starting this Monday.

He explained that the wholesale price is RM1.30 per stem for purchases of 1,000 stems or more, and RM1.50 per stem for smaller quantities.

Zulazrai, who is in the business to augment his income during Hari Raya, said he preferred bamboo sourced from Raub, Pahang, emphasising its superior quality, with consistent lengths ranging from 43 to 45 centimetres.

""I used to get supplies from Kelantan and Terengganu, but they were shorter, between 33 to 35 centimetres, which are lower in demand among lemang vendors,"" said Zulazrai, who also runs a sugarcane business and sells health products online.

Aiming for gross sales of between RM70,000 to RM80,000 this year, he highlighted the numerous risks inherent in the lemang bamboo business, particularly the adverse effects of hot weather, which can potentially damage the bamboo.

Given the prevailing hot weather conditions in Melaka, he explained that the bamboo needs to be watered at least five times a day to maintain moisture levels and prevent cracking or splitting.

Zulazrai explained that upon arrival, the bamboo is sorted and separated by length, diameter, and quality before being bundled for sale.

""Usually, over 600 out of every 10,000 stems we receive are damaged and broken. We cannot return or exchange them as they are bought wholesale,"" he said.

He also mentioned that he has a stock of 4,000 lerek leaves for sale at RM0.50 each, which are used in making lemang. -- Bernama",malaymail.com,news,Malay Mail,,-0.04313725490196074,448968363,12,https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/400x400/197046.jpg,

Here's how the company has positioned itself to take advantage of this veritable windfall.

There's been a great deal of buzz over the past year or so about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (ARM 0.41%) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

If Nvidia is the king of AI, Arm Holdings is arguably the queen.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Danny Vena,0.223529411764706,448968350,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770046/a-circuit-board-with-ai-cpu-branded-on-the-processor.jpg,

Do you spend your free moments obsessing over every little detail from Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi epic? Then The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, a behind-the-scenes look at the film from Insight Editions, will be right up your alley.

Written by Dune producer Tanya Lapointe and Stefanie Broos, The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two dives headfirst into the making of the film. Gorgeous spreads of concept art and photography abound, as well as interviewers with the craftspeople who brought the planets of Arrakis, Giedi Prime, and more to life. Not only will you get to bask in the visual splendor of Dune: Part Two, but you'll learn a lot more about the movie as well. I've laid out five of my favorite tidbits from The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two below, but there are so, so many more where these came from.

Dune: Part Two's opening fight scene between the Fremen and Harkonnen soldiers takes place during a solar eclipse, making for some instantly memorable orange-tinted visuals courtesy of cinematographer Greig Fraser. In an exciting twist of fate, the cast and crew of Dune: Part Two witnessed an actual partial solar eclipse on October 25, 2022. The camera crew was able to capture footage of the eclipse, which wound up in the final cut of the film. To stay true to the lore that Arrakis has two moons, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and his team added a second moon to the eclipse footage.

In my review of Dune: Part Two, I praised the Harkonnens' insectoid architecture as one of the visual highlights of the film. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two confirms the insect inspirations when it comes to all things Harkonnen, but it also singles out one of production designer Patrice Vermette's most surprising points of reference: septic tanks. ""Black, shiny, and new,"" Vermette tells Villeneuve.

The septic tank is just one of many fascinating references for the design teams discussed in the book. Others include the Sardaukar's Excalibur-inspired swords and the Harkonnens' inkblot-esque ""negative fireworks.""

The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two contains no shortage of sandworm goodness, including a pages-long discussion of how the film brought Paul's first worm ride to life. Also of note is the section on the baby worm that lives in the Southern Fremen's Maker's Temple. While a CG worm was a possibility, Dune: Part Two ended up using practical effects, including a worm puppet.

According to The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two, the shot of the baby worm moving through the sand was the biggest challenge for the film's special effects team. They built the worm out of eight balls connected by a chain, then ran it under the sand on two sets of tracks -- one for its circular movements, one for its straight path towards the Maker Keeper (Alison Halstead).

My favorite side characters in Dune: Part Two are the black-clothed Harkonnen servants with distinct curved headdresses who assist Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in the fighting arena on Giedi Prime. They have their roots in Frank Herbert's Dune as Feyd's barb-men, but Lapointe and Broos write that Villeneuve specifically wanted picador silhouettes for these characters, ""just like in bullfighting.""

The bullfighting imagery enhances the showmanship and cruelty of the Harkonnens' war games, with the remaining House Atreides fighter Lanville (Roger Yuan) taking on the role of a doomed bull. It also ties back to House Atreides' deeper connection to bullfighting. As discussed in the first Dune, Paul's (Timothée Chalamet) grandfather fought bulls for sport, even dying in a bullfight. Later, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) walks into a treacherous ""arena"" of his own on Arrakis, and Paul will take on a dangerous, unpredictable enemy in his duel with Feyd. It seems the Atreides can never fully escape bullfighting, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense.

Villeneuve has said he won't release any deleted scenes from Dune: Part Two, which include sequences featuring Stephen McKinley Henderson's Thufir Hawat as well as Tim Blake Nelson in an undisclosed role (which some speculate was Count Fenring). The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also hints at other moments that were cut from the final film.

One such moment came after the funereal ceremony for Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), during which the Fremen take the water from his body. In an early version of the scene, Lapointe and Broos write, Paul receives water rings representing Jamis' water -- a key part of Fremen culture in the novel. The Art and Soul of Dune: Part Two also showcases artwork of the water rings, along with other props used in the ceremony.",mashable.com,news,Mashable,,0.2,448968228,1,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02BkMnKwzvjQFheqhSAhSfh/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1711129309.jpg,eng-9417349

As the moon prepares to blot out the surface of our sun in two weeks, it's warming up with a penumbral lunar eclipse on Sunday night or Monday morning, depending on your time zone.

In general, eclipses are the result of a delicate dance between the moon, the sun and the Earth. Lunar eclipses occur when the planet slides between the sun and the moon. That's in contrast to a solar eclipse, which happens when the moon interjects between the other two bodies.

""It's all about shadows,"" said Noah Petro, a planetary geologist who works on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter for NASA. The sun beams light on Earth, casting a long shadow behind it.

""And every once in a while, the moon wanders into that shadow,"" Dr. Petro said.

In the most dramatic version of the event, the darkest part of Earth's shadow washes over the lunar surface, making it shine crimson. This is a total lunar eclipse, also known as a blood moon.

But you won't see that happen overnight. At 12:53 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, the moon will start to pass through only the outermost part of Earth's shadow, known as the penumbra. As a result, its full face will slightly dim.

Is that worth trying to see? Dr. Petro thinks so. But the change will be difficult to catch with the naked eye, so he encourages using binoculars or a telescope, and taking note of how the moon's brightness changes through the night.",nytimes.com,news,The New York Times,Katrina Miller,-0.003921568627450966,448968078,1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/03/24/multimedia/24sci-first-lunar-eclipse-2024-blmw/24sci-first-lunar-eclipse-2024-blmw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,spa-3425543

Zulazrai, 36, who has been in the business for five years, said that the bamboo is sourced from Raub, Pahang, and to date he has met the demand of approximately 50 lemang vendors in Melaka, Negri Sembilan as well as Muar, and Tangkak in Johor.

""Last year, we started selling it in the middle of Ramadan, but this year we started at the beginning. The demand is very high. We will stop taking orders about five days before Hari Raya Aidilfitri.

""So far there are orders for 37,000 bamboo stems. The highest order is for 10,000 stems. We also sell small quantities if needed,"" he told reporters at his business premises in Pokok Mangga here on Sunday (March 24).

A native of Melaka, Zulazrai said that the suppliers have delivered 20,000 stems so far, with the rest expected to be staggered into four deliveries starting this Monday (March 25).

He explained that the wholesale price is RM1.30 per stem for purchases of 1,000 stems or more, and RM1.50 per stem for smaller quantities.

Zulazrai, who is in the business to augment his income during Hari Raya, said he preferred bamboo sourced from Raub, Pahang, emphasising its superior quality, with consistent lengths ranging from 43 to 45 centimetres.

""I used to get supplies from Kelantan and Terengganu, but they were shorter, between 33 to 35 centimetres, which are lower in demand among lemang vendors,"" said Zulazrai, who also runs a sugarcane business and sells health products online.

Aiming for gross sales of between RM70,000 to RM80,000 this year, he highlighted the numerous risks inherent in the lemang bamboo business, particularly the adverse effects of hot weather, which can potentially damage the bamboo.

Given the prevailing hot weather conditions in Melaka, he explained that the bamboo needs to be watered at least five times a day to maintain moisture levels and prevent cracking or splitting.

Zulazrai explained that upon arrival, the bamboo is sorted and separated by length, diameter, and quality before being bundled for sale.

""Usually, over 600 out of every 10,000 stems we receive are damaged and broken. We cannot return or exchange them as they are bought wholesale,"" he said.

He also mentioned that he has a stock of 4,000 lerek leaves for sale at RM0.50 each, which are used in making lemang.- Bernama",thestar.com.my,news,The Star ,,-0.04313725490196074,448967878,12,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/03/24/2608942.jpg,eng-9421074

According to reports from state media sources, the ruling party is pursuing amendments aimed at restructuring the roles of key institutions, particularly the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), to overhaul electoral processes.

Zanu PF's intention to redistribute responsibilities from ZEC to the Civil Registry Department marks a pivotal move to enhance efficiency in electoral management.

However, critics argue that such changes could pave the way for the manipulation of election outcomes, as Zanu PF has been accused of utilizing electoral bodies to sway results in its favour.

Furthermore, there are plans to reconsider the allocation of delimitation duties, suggesting a return to a previous system where an independent commission handled electoral boundary delineation.

This proposed shift seeks to address administrative redundancies within ZEC and streamline electoral procedures.

Under the envisaged amendments, voter registration processes would be centralized under the Registrar-General's Office.

This move, coupled with the automatic registration of first-time national identity card applicants as voters, aims to streamline the registration process while ensuring accuracy in voter rolls.

Moreover, the proposed amendments aim to expedite the removal of deceased individuals from the voters' roll, following the issuance of death certificates.

Such measures are purportedly aimed at bolstering transparency and integrity in electoral processes.

These proposed changes, influenced by recommendations from Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) legislators, underscore a contentious political landscape.

The amendments, which require constitutional revisions, have sparked debate and raised concerns about potential ramifications for democratic principles.

The evolving political landscape in Zimbabwe underscores the complexities and tensions surrounding efforts to reform electoral systems and consolidate power.

As discussions around constitutional amendments unfold, the implications for the country's democratic trajectory remain a subject of intense scrutiny.

The Raukūmara Range is rugged, dense -- and the last place Omaio man Jason Butler was seen alive in October 2021.

The 50-year-old was on unsanctioned work experience with a Department of Conservation contractor.

The family was told Butler was filing his drink bottle at a river when the contractor left to continue his pest control work.

The contractor emerged from the bush alone the next day -- and the alarm wasn't raised until four days later.

""We still don't really know what happened,"" his sister, Huia Mackley, said. ""We don't know where he is.""

She sent an email to police in November, asking for a progress update on the investigation.

It wasn't until March 20 she got a response, saying, ""significant staffing issues"" meant there had been no further progress, adding ""we have lost a number of staff for various reasons"".

""Sadly,"" the response concluded, ""there is no other available resource in the Eastern BOP.""

""What happens now?"" Huia says. ""Where do we go, the police can't complete their investigation because they don't have resources.""

In a statement to 1News, Detective Senior Sergeant Paul Wilson said the investigation into the disappearance of Jason Butler ""remains active"" and ""planning remains underway for a scene examination and additional search phases"".

However, he said ""Eastern Bay of Plenty CIB has been dealing with a higher-than-usual workload driven by gang-related crime. This includes several homicides involving gang members.""

This has been especially prevalent in parts of the region such as Ōpōtiki.

The Police Minister said the resourcing situation should improve in time but it was up to police leaders on the ground to decide where best to concentrate efforts.

""We've obviously announced an additional 500 new police officers over the next two years,"" says Police Minister Mark Mitchell. ""But in terms of where they're deployed and how they're deployed, that is an operational matter"".

Shortly before he went missing, Butler had been in Whakatāne Hospital under the Mental Health Act.

A Serious Incident Review by Te Whatu Ora stated that, at discharge, he showed no suicidal intent. The health agency has since described his disappearance as a suspected suicide.

""To these agencies, to the Government, to the Police... he's just a statistic, a number to them,"" his sister Huia, said.

Former Detective Inspector Lance Burdett said there needed to be some accountability.

""The launch of the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center will provide our partners across the country with valuable resources to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""The establishment of the Center is the latest example of the Justice Department's work to use every tool provided by the landmark Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to protect communities from gun violence.""

ERPO laws, which are modeled off domestic violence protection orders, create a civil process allowing law enforcement, family members (in most states), and medical professionals or other groups (in some states) to petition a court to temporarily prohibit someone at risk of harming themselves or others from purchasing and possessing firearms for the duration of the order.

In 2023, the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) awarded $238 million to states, territories, and the District of Columbia under the Byrne State Crisis Intervention Program (SCIP), which was created by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and is designed to help jurisdictions implement crisis intervention strategies, including ERPO programs. In addition, OJP awarded $4 million to support training and technical assistance under Byrne SCIP, including $2 million that was awarded to the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions to establish the ERPO Resource Center. In collaboration with OJP's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Center will support states, local governments, law enforcement, prosecutors, attorneys, judges, clinicians, victim service providers, and behavioral health and other social service providers in their efforts to implement ERPO programs to fit local needs, share resources and promising practices with the field, and help ensure that funding received through Byrne SCIP is effectively utilized.

""Supporting our law enforcement and community partners in curbing the scourge of gun violence is more critical than ever,"" said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer. ""In addition to other resources leveraged across the Justice Department, this Center will provide communities with new tools and technical assistance to help them implement effective crisis intervention strategies and reduce gun violence.""

""OJP's investment in ERPO programs demonstrates the Department's commitment to addressing the gun violence crisis in the United States,"" said OJP Assistant Attorney General Amy L. Solomon. ""This crisis cannot be solved at one level of government. We must use all of our resources and collaborate at the federal, state, and local levels to find innovative, evidence-based, and holistic solutions to help keep American communities safe.""

Through the Center and its newly launched website, states, local governments, law enforcement, prosecutors, attorneys, judges, clinicians, victim service providers, and behavioral health and other social service providers will have direct access to critical information that will enhance their ability to reduce firearm homicides and suicides. The website will be maintained and updated to include newly developed resources for the field created through the Center, in partnership with BJA. The website also provides a platform for the Center to highlight emerging and promising practices in successful ERPO implementation and connect states and localities to innovative strategies to reduce gun violence and save lives.

As of this month, 21 states and the District of Columbia have enacted ERPO laws. Successful and effective ERPO implementation requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that incorporates a wide range of stakeholders. The Center is designed to provide resources consistent with that need.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.03529411764705892,448967681,1,,eng-9420443

Physical space is often limited and staff turnover high, while client exit rates are low, especially in day activity centres (DACs) for those with higher support needs who cannot work.

The challenges are growing with the rising prevalence of autism, as those with this condition generally have moderate to higher support needs, said SPD chief executive Abhimanyau Pal.

Funding constraints also make it difficult to hire and retain trained professionals, especially in DACs, said Mr Bernard Chew, chief executive of St. Andrew's Autism Centre (SAAC). His organisation runs two such centres in Siglap and Sengkang which serve 124 persons with autism.

""It is a big concern for the families, and for society when the aged parents pass on,"" noted Jalan Besar GRC MP Denise Phua, who is president of the Autism Resource Centre and chairs Autism Association Singapore. ""We cannot afford to do business as usual.""

On March 6, it was announced that the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will add 500 DAC places and another 500 places to sheltered workshops by 2030. Sheltered workshops provide training or employment for persons with disabilities who can work, but are unable to take up open employment.

To start, 50 DAC places will be added at MINDS Jurong Training and Development Centre by 2025. About 100 sheltered workshop places will also be added to the APSN workshop at Kembangan-Chai Chee Community Hub in 2024.

There are currently eight sheltered workshops with a total capacity of 1,700 places, and 32 DACs with a total of 1,800 places.

As at December 2023, around 1,680 persons with disabilities were enrolled in sheltered workshops, and 1,560 persons were enrolled in DACs.

Some 190 people were waiting to enter sheltered workshops, while 250 people were on the waitlist to enter DACs.

The estimated wait time to enrol in a sheltered workshop ranges from six weeks to a year, while that for DACs ranges from one month to five years, according to service matrices on disability agency SG Enable's website.

One parent told The Sunday Times that his son's experience at a DAC changed drastically after the centre's supervisor and a coach he was familiar with both left.

The retiree, who wanted only to be known as Mr Robert, said his 37-year-old son Jonathan (not his real name) has autism and OCD, and had been in a DAC for the last eight years. After the new coach got frustrated with him, Jonathan refused to go to the DAC for five months.

Mr Robert wanted to pull Jonathan out of the centre, but was advised against doing so by other parents as it would be difficult to re-enter a DAC once he left.

He added that after the staff changes, he found the programmes less engaging and inflexible, even for minor changes such as teaching clients to bake a different flavour of cake.",straitstimes.com,news,The Straits Times,Shermaine Ang,-0.0117647058823529,448967498,1,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/03/24/DAC20clients20engaging20in20physical20exercises.JPG,

Leaders say Nigeria's woes would continue with current system

Since Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999, the suitability of the current federal and presidential system has been a subject of debate among political leaders, intellectuals, lawyers and media practitioners.

The stakeholders have canvassed a new constitution that would spell-out appropriate political system for the country; also reflect the heterogeneous state of the country, the wish of the people of Nigeria and as solution to the nation's numerous challenges.

Many stakeholders say the current system is unlike what obtains elsewhere with emphasis on strong regions and a weak centre and that the country had deviated from the way the system has been practised in other countries, especially from the United States of America where the country copied the presidential system.

This has fuelled agitation for the country to abolish the current system and return to the parliamentary system in several quarters as the National Assembly begins another round of constitutional amendment process.

This was the focus of discussion when eminent Nigerians gathered in Lagos last Monday to address the core challenges bedevilling the country and agreed that a new constitution should be enacted.

The leaders said that Nigeria needed a new constitution that would reflect true federalism and address the problem of the country.

Former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku; Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and leader of Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo, among others, believed continued whitewash of the 1999 constitution amounted to waste of effort and will not guarantee the progress that Nigerians crave for.

Lawyer and human rights activist, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, echoed a similar view, stressing that one million amendments of the 1999 Constitution will never work.

The leaders spoke at a national dialogue on the constitutional future of Nigeria in honour of renowned constitutional lawyer, Ben Nwabueze.

The forum was organised by The Patriots, a pan Nigerian group of eminent national leaders of thought, with the theme, 'Lawful Procedures for Actualising a People's Constitution for Nigeria.'

Anyaoku called for a new constitution to arrest the current deterioration in virtually every aspect of the country's existence.

He stressed that the 1999 constitution lacked the kind of legitimacy expected of a constitution in a pluralistic country like Nigeria.

Anyaoku's views were supported by Sanwo-Olu, Adebanjo, members of the National Assembly, former governors and eminent national leaders, who also demanded a new Nigerian constitution that would reflect true federalism and address the problems of the country.

They said Nigeria had two options in trying to get a truly federal constitution: either adopting the recommendations of the 2014 national confab or going for a relatively inexpensive constituent assembly on a non-party basis to produce a widely acceptable constitution for Nigerians.

Chairman of the Patriots, Anyaoku, said Nigeria was a pluralistic country, which had failed to develop like other pluralistic countries in the world that had succeeded by devolving powers to the federating units.

He cited examples of pluralistic countries, such as Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Sudan, which broke up due to issues bordering on lack of true federalism.

The former Commonwealth secretary-general said for Nigeria to get a truly federal constitution it should either adopt the recommendations of the 2014 national conferences.

He said, ""We go for a relatively inexpensive directly elected constituent assembly on non-party basis for producing such a widely desired constitution.""

He further pointed out that the present 1999 Constitution is not capable of addressing the myriad of challenges confronting Nigeria. He called for the adoption of the recommendations of the 2014 national conference or conduct of an inexpensive constituent assembly that would be nonpartisan in order to have a truly federal constitution.

Anyaoku further said: ""The country needs a new legitimate constitution. And the message of The Patriots, which I have the privilege to be the chairman, is quite clear that The Patriots should take this message to those in government. I like to say that The Patriots will take this message to the Presidency and to the National Assembly.

""We have had pluralistic countries that failed. Yugoslavia, for example, broke up into eight states. Czechoslovakia amicably broke up into two states, and coming home nearer, Sudan, which has existed for centuries broke up into two states.

""So, that should teach us that Nigeria should deliberately manage her diversity. The only way we can successfully manage our diversity, remain as one political entity, is by adopting a true federalist constitution.""

He added, ""First, Nigeria is a pluralistic country that is still struggling to become a nation with assured political stability and progressive socioeconomic development.

""The fact from across the world is that some pluralistic countries have succeeded in becoming nations while other pluralistic countries have failed and disintegrated. The lesson from this is that pluralistic countries, which have succeeded in becoming nations have generally practised true federalism with considerable power devolved to the federating units.

""This fact was acknowledged by our founding fathers, who negotiated painstakingly and agreed to the Independence constitution of ‪1960-1963‬.

""Our present 1999 constitution, as amended, not only lacks the legitimacy that flows from a democratically made constitution but also has proved to be unsuitable for tackling many of the serious challenges confronting our country.

""It is a widely recognised fact that the crucial areas of the country have significantly deteriorated and continue to deteriorate.""

He said that Nigeria had suffered deterioration on many fronts in the areas of security of the citizens' lives and property, economic well-being of the citizens, infrastructure, including roads and education and health facilities, social cohesion and social values and the sense of national unity.

""I am hopeful that we will have a listening hear in the presidency. Why do I say so, I believe we are fortunate at this time to have a president, whose democratic credentials have been very clear to me for many years. Because, the man who is now our president, Ahmed Tinubu, was very active in the NADECO days, and he was one of NADECO representatives who visited my residence in London a number of times. I also remember how he vigorously argued the NADECO cause.

""Even, after I retired as Commonwealth Secretary-General, I had the privilege of chairing a colloquium organised to mark his 60th birthday.

""At that colloquium I called for the restructuring of Nigeria. I said that from my close association of the governments of 54-member countries of the Commonwealth, one lesson I learnt is the pluralistic countries such as Nigeria succeed only on the basis of true federalism.""

In his keynote address titled: 'The never-ending call for a new people's constitution,' Ozekhome described the constitution as the birth certificate and identity card of a nation.

He said the fact that a dictatorial and autocratic military junta imposed the 1999 Constitution completely robbed it of its legitimacy, credibility and acceptability, as it did not represent the nation's identity card, covenant and the supreme will of the Nigerian people.

Ozekhome pointed out that the never-ending call for a new constitution arose from recognition of the inherent fundamental shortcomings of the present 1999 constitution.

He added that mere amendments to or replacements of the constitution under sections 8 and 9, would be akin to merely applying a superficial remedy to a deep-rooted ailment.

According to him, ""It simply cannot and will not work. I humbly submit, as I have done since the year 2000, that one million amendments multiplied by another million amendments, with the addition of yet another million amendments, will never work.

""Merely chopping off the branches of a tree without cutting off the taproot will never kill such a tree. It is akin to merely treating the symptoms of a serious disease.

""Just as one cannot cure cancer with medication meant for minor skin conditions, the need for a new beginning is dire. This is because the process and procedure for crafting a new constitution must be democratic and all-inclusive, as they are more important than the contents of the constitution themselves.

""The simple reason is that it is such a procedure or process that confers legitimacy, credibility and acceptability on the supreme document called constitution.""

Ozekhome added, ""Democracy must be rooted in the constitution. The people should be given a clear voice and mandate to manage the affairs of the nation, through appropriate measures of free and fair elections, and checks and balances.

""The people should be given the rights of access to information, participation in decision making process and access to justice.

""Democracy needs to take significance over politics in Nigeria, and oust the current practice of election malpractices, which prevent free and fair elections. Democracy and rule of law need to be revived once again in Nigeria, and that cannot be done merely by amending the present constitution.

""Rather, the present constitution must be discarded with, and a fresh, new constitution created through a referendum of the people as midwife by the NRC enacted into law by the NASS.

""One cannot amend a bad document; it is simply not possible. An illegitimate document remains illegitimate forever.

""The present Nigerian constitution is a child of bastard and nothing can cure it. Even one million amendments multiplied by another million amendments can never cure the present constitution of Nigeria of its original sin of its illegitimacy.""

Speaking at the event, Governor Sanwo-Olu backed the agitation for a true federal constitution for Nigeria to devolve power to the states and charged the National Assembly to put a legal framework in place for the birth of a new constitution that would be determined by the Nigerian people.

He said the conversation around the making of a new constitution should be driven further.

According to Sanwo-Olu, ""If eminent Nigerians; people who have used better parts of their time serving this country have a conversation and we cannot take it forward and make sure that we have a complete solution, then we are wasting our time. Given the number of people that are here, we should make this conversation very effective.

""Many speakers have said that it is not the National Assembly that will make those amendments and it makes a lot of logical sense. It is for the National Assembly to constitute a law where people will come together and make those amendments themselves.

""I stand here as a leader of the largest state. How well do we see the anomalies that we have in our country? Why would a federal agency come to control the water in front of Ozumba Mbadiwe? Why would a federal agency of 1,000 kilometers away come to see the needs of my people in Ozumba Mbadiwe? Those are some of the things that we need to take forward and say that indeed we need to have a true federating state and be able to amend this constitution.

""I am a willing convert. Whatever we need to do now, there are so many serving and former governors here, let us make the changes that we desire and let the soul of Ben Nwabueze rest in peace because this is something that he fought for over 60 years of his life. And we are still here talking about it. We have the opportunity to make those changes now and I stand here to say to you that we are willing to work with you to make those changes.""

Elder statesman and Afenifere chieftain, Ayo Adebanjo called for the implementation of the 2014 National Conference, which according to him represented how the people of Nigeria want to be governed considering the representation of the people from different parts of the country that attended the national conference.

He said what Nigeria needed was a brand new constitution and not the amendment of the current constitution, which the National Assembly wants to embark on.",businessday.ng,news,Businessday NG,Iwok Iniobong,0.1529411764705881,448967280,1,https://cdn.businessday.ng/2019/06/1999-constitution.jpg,

Mother Dairy, a leading milk supplier in Delhi-NCR, has nine company-owned dairy processing plants with a total capacity of more than 50 lakh litres per day.

In an interview with PTI, Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd MD Manish Bandlish said, ""Summer is the most anticipated season for our business, especially for categories like ice creams, curd and beverages"".

""With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multifold surge in demand for these categories,"" he added.

Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year.

The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to Rs 50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

""As we get into the season, we are all geared up to excite consumers in our golden jubilee year with an array of over 30 new delightful products. The upcoming range will feature around 20 new ice cream products, followed by Greek yoghurts and other dairy products,"" Bandlish said.

Overall, he said the company is very optimistic about the season.

""We expect the demand towards our dairy products to strengthen by 25-30 per cent over the last season's demand,"" Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy has also announced its expansion plan for dairy and fruits and vegetables (F&V) businesses.

These two plants are likely to be completed in about two years.

For the horticulture (fruits and vegetables) segment, the company has its own four plants, while for edible oils it manufactures through 15 associated plants.

Mother Dairy's turnover in 2022-23 stood at around Rs 14,500 crore.

On the expected turnover for this fiscal, Bandlish said, ""Despite a challenging year and subdued summer season last year, deflation in the edible oil sector, the company is likely to exit 2023-24 with a moderate growth rate of around 7-8 per cent in volume terms"".

Mother Dairy was commissioned in 1974. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

Put to bat first by Sunrisers Hyderabad, the Kolkata Knight Riders were off to a fine start as Phil Salt smacked Marco Jansen for three successives in the second over. However, on the last ball of the over, Sunil Narine, who was sent to open the batting, was run out for a duck. KKR was 23/1 in two overs.

This, however, opened the floodgates for some quick wickets, as pacer T Natrajan dismissed Venkatesh Iyer for seven after being caught by Marco Jansen, while the Indian also removed skipper Shreyas Iyer for a duck after he was caught by Pat Cummins. KKR was 32/3 in 3.5 overs.

Nitish Rana and Salt took KKR to a 50-run mark in 7.1 overs. Mayank Markande, however, dismissed Nitish for just nine as his reverse sweep attempt was caught by Rahul Tripathi at deep backward point. KKR had slipped to 51/4 in 7.3 overs.

Ramandeep Singh joined Salt at the crease. The right-hander attacked Cummins, smashing him for a four and six and dispatched Markande for a six. Halfway through the innings, KKR was 77/4, with Salt (36) and Ramandeep (20) unbeaten.

Ramandeep continued his onslaught, hitting Jansen for a four and six. KKR reached the 100-run mark in 11.4 overs. The duo brought up their 50-run stand in just 27 balls.

Salt-Ramandeep partnership was over, with skipper Cummins dismissing the latter and Markande taking a fine diving catch. Ramandeep was back in the hut for 35 in 17 balls, with afour and four sixes. KKR was 105/5 in 12.1 overs.

Salt reached his third IPL fifty in 38 balls, with three fours and three sixes. His entertaining knock ended at 40 balls for 54 runs, consisting of three fours and three sixes. Markande took his second wicket, while Jansen took a catch at deep midwicket. KKR was 119/6 in 13.5 overs.

Andre Russell and Rinku Singh were the fresh pair on the crease. Russell was at his aggressive best, smashing Markande for two sixes and then smoking Bhuvneshwar Kumar for two fours and a six in the 17th over.

KKR reached the 150-run mark in 16.3 overs and Russell-Rinku also recorded their 50-run stand in 22 balls.

Rinku-Russell continued to smoke KKR during death overs, with the duo taking 15 runs from Natrajan's 18th over.

Russell was in no mood to spare Bhuvneshwar, as in the 19th over, the pacer was smoked for two fours and two sixes, 26 runs in total. Russell reached his fifty in 20 balls, with two sixes and six sixes.

KKR reached the 200-run mark in 19 overs.

However, the 81-run partnership in 32 balls came to an end with Rinku being caught by Aiden Markram at long-on for 23 in 15 balls, with three fours. KKR was 200/7 in 19.1 overs.

KKR ended their innings at 208/7, with Russell unbeaten at 64 in 25 balls, with three fours and seven sixes and Mitchell Starc unbeaten at 6.

Natrajan (3/32) and Markande (3/39) were the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins got one wicket. (ANI)",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.01960784313725483,448967056,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ani1711220729.jpg,

lan Finkel (''⁣Yes, nuclear's an option. But let there be no confusion about its flaws''⁣, 23/3) is an eminent and successful man. However, his claims for nuclear power having a small footprint and low death rate are wildly optimistic. Its footprint crosses national borders, oceans and generations.

Chernobyl and Fukushima regions are uninhabitable for generations to come and their impacts measurable around the globe. The Ukraine war makes clear the danger of military and sabotage damage to any nuclear power reactor.

Populations downwind and downriver are constantly exposed to genetic damage and health issues, most of which become apparent only long after accidents, our food sources contaminated.

How can we consider any energy source from which we briefly benefit in the very short term, takes decades to dismantle, and leaves all following generations to suffer the consequences and costs of undetectable radiation?

Not all gas production is bad

Victoria has plenty of onshore gas in Gippsland. When I was chair of the Energy Users' Association of Australia I attended a meeting with the Victorian Labor government regarding the proposed fracking ban for onshore gas fields.

I was one of the few people who tried to get the government to understand that fracking wasn't required for onshore gas drilling in Victoria, but they didn't want to allow any onshore drilling for gas at all, so they put a ban on it. The opposition went along with them.

If drilling for gas in Gippsland was allowed, it could be brought on in a couple of years as all the facilities are already in place.

It would help stabilise gas supply and gas prices and shore up manufacturing in Victoria, as well as providing gas for generators so that coal fired generators can be fazed out without electricity supply shortfalls. If all gas users are made to convert to electricity immediately then there will be a huge shortage, and the cost will go through the roof.

Mother Dairy will launch this summer 30 new products, mainly in ice cream and yoghurt categories, as it expects a 25-30 per cent increase in consumer demand, a top company official said.

Mother Dairy, a leading milk supplier in Delhi-NCR, has nine company-owned dairy processing plants with a total capacity of more than 50 lakh litres per day.

In an interview with PTI, Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd MD Manish Bandlish said, ''Summer is the most anticipated season for our business, especially for categories like ice creams, curd and beverages''. ''With the Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) prediction of above-normal temperatures and a hot summer this year, we are expecting a multifold surge in demand for these categories,'' he added.

Already, Bandlish said there is an uptick in sales of ice creams compared to the previous year.

The company, he said, is fully prepared to match this growing demand and has invested up to Rs 50 crore to augment capacities to ensure adequate availability of its products.

''As we get into the season, we are all geared up to excite consumers in our golden jubilee year with an array of over 30 new delightful products. The upcoming range will feature around 20 new ice cream products, followed by Greek yoghurts and other dairy products,'' Bandlish said.

Overall, he said the company is very optimistic about the season.

''We expect the demand towards our dairy products to strengthen by 25-30 per cent over the last season's demand,'' Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy has also announced its expansion plan for dairy and fruits and vegetables (F&V) businesses.

The company will invest Rs 650 crore to set up two new plants for processing milk and fruits and vegetables.

It will also invest another Rs 100 crore to expand the capacities of its existing plants, taking the total capex to Rs 750 crore. ''In our endeavour to expand our distribution and reach to our consumers, we have earmarked a capital expenditure (capex) outlay of over Rs 750 crore to enhance our dairy and F&V processing capacities across key locations,'' Bandlish said.

Mother Dairy is coming up with a big dairy plant in Nagpur with an investment of around Rs 525 crore.

The greenfield plant will have a processing capacity of 6 lakh litres of milk per day.

''We also plan to commission a new fruit processing plant in Karnataka with an investment of over Rs 125 crore under our Safal brand,'' Bandlish said.

These two plants are likely to be completed in about two years.

For the horticulture (fruits and vegetables) segment, the company has its own four plants, while for edible oils it manufactures through 15 associated plants.

Mother Dairy's turnover in 2022-23 stood at around Rs 14,500 crore. On the expected turnover for this fiscal, Bandlish said, ''Despite a challenging year and subdued summer season last year, deflation in the edible oil sector, the company is likely to exit 2023-24 with a moderate growth rate of around 7-8 per cent in volume terms''. Mother Dairy was commissioned in 1974. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). Mother Dairy was established under the initiative of 'Operation Flood', the world's biggest dairy development programme, launched to make India a milk-sufficient nation.

Mother Dairy, one of the leading dairy players in India, manufactures, markets and sells milk and milk products, including cultured products, ice creams, paneer, ghee, etc under the 'Mother Dairy' brand.

The company also has a diversified portfolio with products in edible oils under the 'Dhara brand and fresh fruits & vegetables, frozen vegetables & snacks, unpolished pulses, pulps & concentrates, etc. under the 'Safal brand.

It has hundreds of milk booths and Safal retail outlets in Delhi-NCR.

Mother Dairy sells more than 35 lakh litres of fresh milk (pouched and token milk) per day in Delhi-NCR.

The Tournaneena man shot a three-under 68 on the feared Copperhead Course at Innisbrook resort in west Florida to go into the final round tied for second with Mackenzie Hughes and Paul Malnati on eight-under-par, just two shots behind the Chattanooga native.

Mitchell (32) produced a spectacular finish as he followed birdies at the 16th and 17th with a hole-out eagle two at the last.

Nobody had ever played the three-hole stretch known as Snake Pit in seven shots in the history of the tournament.

But after going out in one-over, Mitchell birdied the 12th from 20 feet and the 14th from just three before that special finish gave him a remarkable back nine of 28.

Power (37) is seeking his third PGA Tour win after a year spent battling a hip injury that's seen him fall from 28th to 103rd in the world and miss out on a Ryder Cup place.

A win would catapult him into the Masters next month and likely the rest of the majors, but he knows he'll have to reproduce the sensationally steady play of the first three days to pull it off in what could prove to be a shootout.

""I did everything pretty well today, to be honest,"" said Power, who made a 25-footer for birdie at the 15th before finishing with three pars, deftly chipping dead from up against the collar of rough at the last.

""Very pleased. It's a tough golf course, tricky conditions.""

The big Munster man opened with six pars before he made birdies at the sixth and seventh to move right into contention.

He dropped a shot when he drove into a fairway bunker at the ninth but birdied the par-five 12th before moving to eight-under and into a share of the lead with that two at the 15th.

""It wasn't the quickest start,"" he said. ""Didn't birdie one or didn't birdie five (the two par fives), but I was able to hang in there, hit some good shots.

""Eventually holed a good putt there on 15 to kind of feel a little better. But, yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.""

He's ranked second for driving accuracy, first for greens hit in regulation and 21st for putting, which bodes well for what promises to be a tight finish as the top 17 on the leaderboard are covered by just five shots.

When asked what's been the biggest challenge posed by the Copperhead Course, Power didn't lie.

""I think it's everything,"" he said. ""I think that's what makes it such a good golf course.

""You've got to drive it well; it's difficult when you're not in the fairways. And if you hit the greens, they're grainy, and they're tricky, and they're slopey.

""You've got to hit it in the right spots and try to make some putts on greens like that. I think it tests all aspects of the game. I think that's why it's such a good golf course.""

He's tied for second with Malnati and Canada's Hughes while the still winless Cam Young, Brendon Todd and Chandler Phillips are just one shot further back on seven under.

With more than a dozen players within striking distance, Power is under no illusions about what awaits him today - not a duel with Mitchell but a blanket finish.

""I would imagine so. I haven't really seen much of a leaderboard, don't watch too much of 'em, but it is tough to get a low one out there.

""No matter how well you played, it was going to be tough to get much better than 4-, 5-under, I thought.

""It's tough to get away from the pack, so it's going to be some guys in with a chance.

""I think they're going two balls tomorrow, so maybe some guys that get out early will have a chance to post something. So we'll see.

""Anything can happen, depends on conditions obviously as well.""

As for his game, Power would like to have holed a few more putts, but he's got the dogged game required to win in difficult conditions on a tough course

""I think it's just been pretty solid across the board,"" he said. ""I'll look at the stats again after today, but through two rounds, it's pretty steady, there were no major weaknesses.

""And, yeah, just maybe a couple more putts drop in today, but I hit a lot of good putts, which was cool, a lot of good speed putts, so maybe some of those drop in tomorrow, give myself a chance.""",independent.ie,news,Irish Independent,,0.1372549019607843,448966885,1,https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif,eng-9420877

Their installed capacity could reach 186 GW by the end of 2020. The cold climate sites impose the risk of ice accumulation on turbines during the winter due to the humidity at low temperatures. Since the atmospheric and operating conditions of the wind turbine leading to blade icing vary stochastically in space and time, the resulting ice accumulation is completely random, it is even different for turbines within the same site. Ice accumulation alters aerofoil shapes of the blade, affecting their aeroelastic behavior. The icing severity at different locations of the blade and their non-uniform distribution on blades have a distinct influence on turbine power output and vibrations. The current thesis proposes a methodology to investigate such behavior of wind turbines by considering the structural and aerodynamic property changes in the blade due to icing. An automated procedure is used to scale simulated/measured ice shape on aerofoil sections of the blade according to a specified ice mass distribution. The aeroelastic behavior of the blades is simulated considering the static aerodynamic coefficients of the iced aerofoil sections. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW baseline wind turbine model. The method can be leveraged to analyze the influence of icing on any wind turbine model. De/Anti-icing systems are installed on the turbines to mitigate the risks associated with icing. It is essential to detect icing at the early stage and initiate these systems to avoid production losses and limit the risks associated with ice throw. Ice accumulation increases blade mass and its spatial distribution changes natural frequencies of the blade. A detection technique is proposed in this thesis to characterize ice mass distribution on the blades based on its natural frequencies. The detection technique is validated using experiments on a small-scale cantilever beam and 1-kW wind turbine blade set-ups and its effectiveness is also verified on large-scale wind turbine blades using numerical models. The proposed technique has the potential for detecting ice masses on large wind turbines operating in cold climate as it requires only first few natural frequencies of the blade. These natural frequencies are usually excited by the turbulent wind in operation/standstill conditions and they can be estimated from the vibration measurements of the blade.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.01960784313725483,448966531,1,,eng-9420920

The stand-off between Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi and the Supreme Court is still on and this week, the lawyer roped in the Attorney General.

He moved to the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) seeking Sh200 million in damages over the ban to appear before the apex court.

In his petition, Ahmednasir wants the EACJ to issue an order directing AG Justin Muturi to reverse the pronouncement made by the Supreme Court that barred him from appearing before it.

Ahmednassir says the Sh200 million damages he is seeking are fees that he lost for cases he had conducted before the Supreme Court.

In January this year, the Apex court in a letter by Registrar Letizia Wachira barred Ahmednasir and employees of his law firm from filing cases before it over what it termed as incessant attacks.

It said he represented the land's purported vendor as his lawyer despite knowing that his client did not bid or participate in the tender with the Council.

It added that he had received the money as payment knowing that he was not entitled to the same.

""Among other recipients of the funds aforesaid was the defendant (Mutunga) who was paid the sum of Sh25.9 million over and above his legal fees as the lawyer acting for the purported vendor in the said fraudulent transaction,"" the court was told.

Justice Sifuna declines to recuse himself from Tanui case

A month, after he made a precedent on the withdrawal of cases by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Justice Nixon Sifuna, declined to bow out the case.

He refused to recuse himself from hearing an application filed by the ODPP that seeks to review orders blocking it from withdrawing the Sh30 million graft case facing former Kenya Pipeline Company boss Charles Tanui and two others.

In his ruling on Thursday, the Milimani Law Courts Judge said issues of bias on the court must be reasonable and not speculative.

""A judicial officer presiding in a case will have no difficulty recusing himself where he knows or it is sufficiently demonstrated that he is biased, likely to be biased or unlikely to be impartial,"" Sifuna said.

The DPP was opposed to the matter being handled by the Judge claiming he previously dismissed a similar application arising from the same criminal case.

The DPP was also opposed to the Judge handling the case because of the numerous times he has pronounced himself regarding their practice of withdrawing cases in court.

Former PC Chelogoi detained in Sh1.35 billion land case

On Thursday, the Milimani Chief Magistrates Court detained former PC Davis Chelogo in Sh1.35bn land case.

Chelogoi had previously failed to honour court summons, despite four previous warrants of arrest being issued against him.

The court had directed him to appear before it on Thursday morning for plea-taking but failed to show up.

Principal magistrate Dolphina Alego issued another arrest warrant before Chelogoi finally appeared in court.

He pleaded not guilty to six counts of fraud, conspiracy to defraud and forgery.

His lawyer Tom Ojienda requested for lenient bond terms saying Chelogoi was not a flight risk.

This was however opposed by the state as did lawyers representing the complainant Ashok Shah who claims his land was forcefully taken away.

The ruling on the former PC's bond application will be issued on Monday.

Court rules law limiting freedom of speech unconstitutional

The High Court in Nakuru has declared Section 77 (1) and (3) of the Penal Code unconstitutional.

Delivering the judgment on Monday, Justice Samwel Muhochi said the section is over-broad and vague adding that it limits the right to freedom of expression without clarity as to the purpose and intent.

""A Declaration is hereby issued that, section 77 (1) and (3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the Penal Code, Cap 63 is unconstitutional,"" he ruled.

Justice Muhochi added that the enforcement of the Section and its provision against any member of the public is unconstitutional.

The judgment stemmed from a petition filed before the court by the Katiba Institute, Law Society of Kenya, ICJ, Bloggers Association, KUJ, and KHRC among others.

They argued that Section 77 of the Penal Code had no place in a modern democratic state like Kenya, saying that it is of a colonial legacy that limits freedom of expression through the vaguely worded offence of ""subversion"".

The petitioners told the court that ""subversion"" is an antiquated way of suppressing and penalising the expression of political dissent.

They said this amounted to a violation of the right to freedom of expression under international law.",the-star.co.ke,news,The Star,,0.02745098039215677,448966421,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b0Fl-dzsIeFSF9zS1CH7mQ2qo2X61-YOmZCCUU43Rlau12fAUonmCzVv1TdN1AMgpp4cSGu-tYv4GcKsCySi1k5ml4kGTWBPLb3Pi8Gn=s1000,

But further growth will only be possible if the entire food chain is reformed - and everyone is willing to pay a fair price. The so-called short series still has a long way to go.

A customer reports to the counter and for a moment Rick Fransens takes his eyes off the cappuccino he's making. ""I'll be right with you."" He's used to multitasking. As the owner of White Label, a café located on Zonneplein in Noord, he does everything he can himself. It's a great job - especially if, like the Franssens, you prefer to work with local and organic produce.

He would prefer to choose all the suppliers himself, but this is not possible. ""You are also here on Earth. It is good to trust someone who can maintain this connection.""

That's why he's been working with Chef Centraal for years, a supplier that sells food and drinks from the region to Amsterdam's catering industry. Founder Karel Raymakers sees his customer base growing every week. ""We are doing well. We have 200 customers and 40 to 50 suppliers."" Its sales volume is estimated at 45 thousand euros per week, 50 percent higher than last year. ""And there are still many opportunities,"" Raymakers smiles proudly.

Rabobank says these opportunities are being exploited more and more. It is estimated that the amount of food produced locally in the Amsterdam region and also sold in that region has doubled since 2020.

Decision makers in the municipality and the province of North Holland will be satisfied with this. According to them, short series are the future. Now, each bite of food travels an average of 30,000 kilometers before it ends up on our plates - also calculations made by Rabobank. 50% of our food and drinks come from abroad.

This has to change, says Kees-Willem Rademakers. ""During Corona we suddenly saw that our food distribution is not as strong as we thought.""

CNN --

A significant storm in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest is expected to bring heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions through Tuesday morning, setting the stage for hazardous travel and power outages.

Back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow as they had all winter, and the latest storm is expected to have longer-lasting impacts than the last.

The ""high-impact"" storm is expected to produce strong, gusty winds and widespread heavy snow over parts of the regions through early next week, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The snow and wind will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow as well as possible blizzard conditions Sunday into Monday.

""Disruptions to daily life"" are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday.

Blizzard warnings have been issued for parts of Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.

""Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,"" the National Weather Service in Goodland, Kansas, warned. ""If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.""

Heavy snow will spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Sunday, continuing into Tuesday. At least 8 inches of snow could cover northern Nebraska and central South Dakota to central Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.

Minneapolis could see up to 12 inches in some areas by Tuesday, rivaling the 11 inches it received over the entirety of the winter season.

Earlier this week, another storm dropped several inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes, beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning. But the storm this weekend will usher in more widespread and troublesome.

More than 300,000 customers were already without power across three states early Sunday, including more than 190,000 in Maine, more than 74,000 in New Hampshire and more than 78,000 in New York, according to poweroutage.us.

""We have more than 6,000 utility workers in the state working to restore power,"" said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a statement Saturday. ""While the worst of the storm is over and snow and ice should taper off as the evening continues, we are closely tracking 80,000 power outages statewide.""

The weather service warned the storm over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will bring strong winds and dump heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines.

Hazardous travel and road closures in the affected areas are expected into early next week. Wind gusts over 50 mph on Sunday could also result in difficult travel, property damage and power outages in the Central and Southern Plains, the weather service warned.

Heavy snow will continue through late Sunday morning over Northern New England. Meanwhile, flood watches on the East Coast are lingering over coastal New Jersey and Delaware.

Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms that could also produce strong wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes are forecast to develop Sunday from central Texas into Kansas. Severe thunderstorms will move into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday, according to the NWS.

At its creation, the state was made up of the former llorin and Kabba provinces of the then Northern region, and was initially christened the West Central State, but was later changed to Kwara, a local name for the River Niger.

Of all the thirty-six state in Nigeria, Kwara is the sixth least populous with an estimated population of about 3.2million people, as at 2016. The sobriquet, State of Harmony, is such a perfect byname as the state is reputed for hospitality, and it is the gateway between the South and the North. Kwara is no doubt one of the religious states in Nigeria, as this is evidently palpable in the serenity and tranquility of things within the state. The people of Kwara are very courteous and charitable, both in conduct and character.

Unlike some other states, Kwara is not ethnically homegenous- in tongues and tribes. The state is made up with mostly three major ethnic groups who are indigenous to it. Yoruba(which is the majority), Nupe, Baruba, and Fulanis(minorities). The people of Kwara are heavily industrious in active farming with interest in principal crops like cotton, cocoa, coffee, kolanut, tobacco, benseed, palm produce, industries and services, livestock herding and ranching of cattle, goats, fishing and sheep.

As a north central state, it receives goods and other services from the north and south, and little wonder the cost of living in Kwara is bearable and affordable. And one admirable thing that one can not take away from Kwara is cleanliness which they say is next to godliness, and Islam enjoins that Muslims are encouraged to maintain cleanliness in all aspects of their lives, from personal hygiene to environmental cleanliness because this promotes spiritual purity, health, well-being, respect for oneself and others, and social interactions.

Politically, there is a huge disparity and inequality in Kwara. As stated by the Nigerian constitution, Kwara has three senatorial districts namely: Kwara Central, Kwara South, and Kwara North. Of all the aforementioned senatorial districts, it is only Kwara North that has never had the taste of the executive pudding- since the advent of democracy in 1999, which is almost twenty-five years now, Kwara North extraction has never presided over the affairs of the state.

To be more succinct, former governor Admiral Lawal Mohammed, who was the first civilian governor ruled state between 1999-2003, from the Central; and he was succeeded by former Senator Bukola Saraki, who ruled the state between 2003-2011, from the Central; former governor AbdulFatah Ahmed, from the South ruled between 2011-2019, before the O'toge struggle that eclipsed the Saraki's political dynasty.

The O'toge movement in 2019 birthed the present day government of governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq, who mounted the leadership saddle five years ago and he is also from the Central.

Ukraine has suffered a second day of intense bombing of its power stations, plunging half a dozen regions into darkness, as the Kremlin tries to take advantage of Kyiv's dwindling supply of air defence ammo.

At the same time, the US asked Zelenskiy's administration to curb its long-distance drone strikes on Russia's oil refineries, as production has dropped by 10% since the start of the year, threatening an oil product price strike ahead of US elections slated for this November.

On the night of March 21-22, Russian forces launched a combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine's critical infrastructure using a total of 151 aerial weapons that cost well over $300mn, according to reports.

Ukrainian air defence units managed to destroy 92 Russian aerial targets, but an increasing number of Russian missiles are getting through to hit their targets as Ukraine starts to run low on air defence ammo. Blackouts not seen for about a year were back as important power plants were struck and suffered major damage.

Emergency power outages are taking place in a number of Ukrainian regions after reports of damage to power generating facilities, the Ukrainian energy holding DTEK and regional authorities reported.

Blackouts have been reported in eight regions, including the Dnipro Region and in the Kyiv-controlled areas of the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as ""stabilisation outages"" in the Odesa Region.

According to the regional authorities, over 110,000 residents of the Poltava Region will be disconnected ""to balance the power grid"", while in the Sumy Region emergency cut-off plans will be implemented in several districts.

It appears that the Kremlin is trying to take advantage of Kyiv's increasingly dire financial state after the US ran out of money for Ukraine in January and halted supplies of badly needed weapons and ammo. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Western leaders last week to urgently send more munitions, but the Ministry of Finance (MinFin) admitted last week that Ukraine has only received 10% of the arms and cash promised last month at the 20 Ramstein meeting.

The barrage began on March 21, hitting cities across the country. A Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia on March 22 claimed the lives of three people: a father and daughter aged 35 and 8, and a 62-year-old trolleybus driver who was driving along the dam of the Dnipro hydroelectric power plant (HPP), the Kyiv Independent reports.

The target was the Dnipro HPP, a major source of power, which was struck by eight missiles and suffered extensive damage.

Ukraine is currently suffering from the most intense missile and drone attack since the start of the war more than two years ago - even more intense than the first barrage launched in January designed to run Ukrainian's stock of defensive missiles down, a tactic that now seems to be paying dividends for Russia.

Russian forces are exploiting Ukraine's air defence shortages to plunge the country into darkness and destroy the country's energy grid in the largest strike since the start of the conflict, according to a report from Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

More than 130 energy infrastructure facilities have been targeted across the country over the last two days. The Dnipro HPP is the largest facility in Ukraine and was a key target, but dozens of other power stations have also been hit and damaged, according to reports.

The Dnipro HPP is now reported to be in a critical condition after its turbine room and electrical equipment were seriously damaged, director Igor Sirota reportedly said.

""We are losing the station. The HPP-2 is in danger. We don't know at what capacity it will be able to operate. The HPP-2 is in critical condition. The HPP-1 has also stopped operations, so we are doing everything we can to raise the gates and process the water,"" Ukraine's Strana media outlet quoted him as saying.

""We will have to fully rebuild the turbine room and repair electrical equipment,"" he added, noting that there was no threat of a dam break.

The current onslaught has sent residents of cities around Ukraine scuttling back into air raid shelters that haven't been much used since the last assault on Ukraine's power infrastructure in the winter of 2022.

The air defences provided by the US and European allies have proved so effective that bne IntelliNews' correspondent in Kyiv reported the locals had become increasingly blasé about air raid siren alerts, often choosing to ignore them and continue going about their business. But that has changed dramatically in the few last days as the combination of falling levels of ammo and the sheer intensity of the attack have driven people underground again.

The skies are open again to a Russian assault that threatens to repeat the destruction of half the country's energy infrastructure, as occurred in the winter 2022 campaign. The Washington Post recently reported that the shortage of air defence ammo has become so acute that Kyiv may soon be limited to being able to shoot down only one in five inbound missiles.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the ISW said.

With international supplies of weapons falling off, Ukraine's strategy is to become a military production hub and make more of the arms and ammo it needs at home. Depriving Ukraine of power will make that task a lot harder.

Ukraine launched a counter-punch in February that is also designed to run down Russia's ability to supply its forces and earn money to run its war machine by targeting Russia's oil refineries with long-range missiles.

However, the Financial Times reported last week that the US has urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, warning senior SBU and GUR officials that drone strikes risk driving up global oil prices and provoking retaliation.

Russia crude oil refining production has dropped to a ten-month low and is down at 5mn barrels per day (bpd) from March 14-20, or a 10% fall year on year. after Ukraine began a drone war in February using new long-range domestically produced drones to attack Russia's refining capacity deep inside Russian territory.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak denied that Washington had called on Kyiv to halt the drone strikes on Russian assets.

""This is fictitious information. After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for waging this war. Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of warfare. Fuel is the basic tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy its fuel infrastructure,"" Podolyak said as cited by Ukrayinska Pravda.

Podolyak argued that Russia is in the midst of a major attack against Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure with genocidal intentions, while Ukraine has responded with its own attacks against the Russian infrastructure of war.

Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, followed up saying that Russia's oil refineries are ""legitimate targets of Ukraine from a military point of view."" According to her, Ukraine is acting in accordance with Nato standards in this case, in statements that defy the US concerns.

""We understand the requests of American partners. But we wage war with the capabilities, resources and practices that are available to us,"" she said during the second Ukrainian Security Forum.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on his Nato allies to ""close the skies"" from the very first week of the war, but Nato has never responded, leaving Ukraine vulnerable to missile attacks. The supply of sophisticated anti-missile systems, and the US-made Patriot system in particular - have alleviated the problem somewhat, but the Patriot missiles are expensive and in short supply, whereas Russia has ramped up the production of cheap weaponised drones that it is firing at Ukraine in their droves.

Commenting on the hostile attack by the Russians on March 22, Stefanishyna welcomed the words of support from Ukraine's Western allies, but words alone are insufficient, given the scale and intensity of the current attack.

""I want to draw attention to the fact that the situation is already very bad... Over the past two months we have received 10% of the planned financial resources necessary for the survival of the state, and also have not received military assistance, which was planned for almost a year within the Ramstein format by more than 50 countries around the world,"" Stefanishyna said. ""Reaction is one thing, but we expect weapons first of all.""",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.5058823529411764,448966040,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Ukraine_industry_factory_energy_power_station_electricity_business_0.jpeg,eng-9416762

The Delaware Emergency Management Agency has announced two upcoming events that residents within a 10-mile radius of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear-generating stations need to be aware of.

Siren activation and emergency alert system test

On Tuesday, April 2, at 7:20 p.m., DEMA, Delaware State Police and the Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. will conduct a quarterly test of the Alert and Notification system for the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations in Salem County, New Jersey.

During the test, which is done to monitor the integrity of the siren system, sirens will be activated for three to five minutes, followed by a test message of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on local radio stations, according to Delaware.gov.

There are 37 sirens in Delaware located within a 10-mile radius of the nuclear-generating stations. These sirens cover an area north from Delaware City, west to Middletown and south to Woodland beach.

During an actual emergency, the sirens would produce a series of steady three- to five-minute siren sounds that would alert residents to turn their radio to an EAS station for emergency instructions and information, according to Delaware.gov.

For more information about the test, call DEMA at 1-877-SAY-DEMA (1-877-729-3362) or (302) 659-3362 and ask for Georgina Harris-Sharper or Albert Samah.

Free potassium iodide tablets for residents

Free potassium iodide (KI) tablets will be distributed to those who live or work within a 10-mile radius of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations in Salem County, New Jersey, also known as the Emergency Planning Zone.

The effort is a partnership between DEMA and the Delaware Division of Public Health. The free tablet distribution will take place on Thursday, April 4, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Townsend Fire Company at the Volunteer Hose Co. Of Middletown at 27 West Green Street in Middletown.

KI tablets are available to residents who have received them in the past and whose tablets have reached their expiration date, as well as those who never received tablets before, according to Delaware.gov.

Residents with home or business addresses within the EPZ are eligible to receive KI tablets. To do so, recipients must bring a photo ID such as a driver's license, proof of residency such as a utility bill or proof of employment within the EPZ when they go to the pickup location.

If you have expired KI tablets, you can bring those to the distribution center to exchange them for new ones.

The 10-mile EPZ in Delaware is comprised of four Emergency Response Planning Areas:

To check whether you are within the EPZ, visit de.gov/epz.

KI does not protect against external radiation, but it can help protect the thyroid gland from ingested or inhaled radioactive iodine that could be released in a radiation emergency. The tablet is one of the protective measures outlined in Delaware's emergency plans developed for use in a nuclear incident and is provided through a program from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Delaware.gov.

If you live outside of the 10-mile EPZ and would like to get KI tablets, you can contact your pharmacist. KI tablets are also available over the counter at some local pharmacies.

The wind power project, located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from capital Dhaka, is invested by Wuling Power Corp., a subsidiary of China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC), and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp..

Upon full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households.

Md. Abdul Kader Goni, the executive engineer of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told Xinhua that Bangladesh entered the era of first commercial wind power with the establishment of the wind power plant at Cox's Bazar.

Hei Zhao, general manager of Bangladesh division of Wuling Power Corp., said this is the first time that Chinese enterprises have introduced wind power into Bangladesh as investors, filling the gap in the wind power field in Bangladesh.

""During the construction of the project, we used Chinese solutions, Chinese standards and Chinese equipment to promote the sustainable development of Bangladesh's renewable energy industry, while training the first batch of practical talents in the field of wind power for Bangladesh and providing more than 1,500 local jobs,"" he added.

The decommissioning of all units had been planned earlier. In order to save natural gas in power generation during the energy crisis, the German government had taken five units out of the so-called supply reserve. Two further units were allowed to continue operating beyond the originally planned shutdown date. All were allowed to sell their electricity wholesale. At the end of the winter of 2023/24, it will finally be over.

Units E and F at the Niederaussem power plant and unit C at the Neurath power plant in the Rhineland mining district were taken out of standby. All of them belong to the RWE energy group. In the Lusatian coalfield, units E and F at the Jänschwalde power plant, which belong to the energy company Leag, were reclaimed. In addition, two further units (D and E) at RWE's Neurath power plant were extended.

Former employees also returned from retirement to their old jobs for the reactivation of the plants from security standby. Others postponed the start of their retirement.

The seven units have a total output of around 3.1 gigawatts. By comparison, the Datteln 4 hard coal-fired power plant has an output of just under 1.1 gigawatts. According to the Federal Network Agency, electricity generation plants with a total capacity of 245 gigawatts were on the market in Germany in November. Renewable energy sources accounted for around 159 gigawatts of this.

The grid agency does not believe that the shutdowns will affect the security of supply. ""The closures have been planned and taken into account accordingly in all supply forecasts. Security of supply is still guaranteed,"" said a spokesperson. Electricity will be generated in the European network where it is cheapest. ""Germany and the other European countries benefit mutually from the most favorable generation conditions."" In each case, the cheapest generation technologies currently available would be used first, said the spokesperson.

The Federal Ministry of Economics is legally obliged to examine how much additional greenhouse gas has been emitted by the continued operation of coal-fired power plants. It must make proposals by the end of June as to what measures can be taken to offset these additional emissions./tob/DP/zb",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1372549019607843,448965441,1,,

""Unfortunately, the expected speed of the expansion of renewable energies does not yet match reality,"" said Michael Kohn, Head of Global Project Finance at Baywa r.e..

""Solar plants often take up to five years from planning to construction. Wind farms are more complex in terms of approval. It can take even longer."" However, the manager emphasized that this also applies to other countries: ""Not only in Germany, but in many markets."" The Munich-based company plans and builds wind and solar parks internationally with 5400 employees worldwide.

The German government aims to cover 80 percent of German electricity consumption from renewable energies by 2030. There is a consensus in the industry that expansion needs to progress faster to achieve this target - and that bureaucracy is one of the obstacles.

The German Association of Energy and Water Industries, the Association of Municipal Enterprises and management consultants Deloitte estimated in the fall that annual investment in the energy transition would have to increase almost fivefold by 2030 compared to 2022: from 22 billion to 100 billion euros.

Apart from the capital requirements, this would also mean more work for the authorities. However, according to Baywa r.e., they are already at the limits of their capacity at the current pace: ""This cannot be accelerated immediately and aligned with the expansion requirements, partly due to a lack of staff in the offices that process the permits,"" said Kohn.

In Germany, objections and lawsuits also make the procedures more difficult and unpredictable in terms of time and content. Appeals and lawsuits are very important, but ""in our opinion, they should be limited to the important areas worthy of protection,"" said Kohn. ""We see complaints from residents who have legitimate concerns, for example about the noise and shadows cast by a wind turbine."" These concerns are best addressed beforehand in dialog or as part of the approval process. ""However, it is often the case that people sue for the sake of it, even if there is no prospect of success. A lawsuit usually means a delay of up to several years.""

The next major obstacle in many markets is the grid connection. ""There is often a bottleneck in the availability of grid connection capacities. In some cases, connection points are allocated that are far too far away from the actual project.""

Easier financing

According to Kohn, however, financing new green energy plants in Germany is generally less complex than abroad: ""Instead of requiring extensive external advice - including legal, tax, technical and insurance advice - as is quite common in the international environment, the project assessment in Germany is generally carried out within the bank without the help of external consultants,"" said the financing expert. ""This means that very time-critical and often complex work packages are shortened.""

Baywa r.e. emerged from the green electricity business of the Baywa Group, which was originally active in agricultural trade, and generated sales of almost 6.5 billion euros in 2022. The parent company will publish the figures for 2023 at the end of the week. ""At the moment, we as an industry are dealing with very tense market parameters, still high inflation rates, high interest rates, high investment costs and one or two uncertainties in the supply chains,"" said Kohn. However, banks and other investors are still keen to invest. ""Overall, the industry in Germany is continuing to grow and we are very confident about the future thanks to our well-filled project pipeline.""/cho/DP/zb",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1764705882352942,448965438,1,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

BlackRock is the top fund manager in the world. In mid-2023, this fund manager filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) & finally secured regulatory approval in Jan 2024. The SEC body approved a total of 11 Bitcoin spot ETF products at once and currently, 9 of them are trading on the stock exchanges with strong dominance.

Recently Robert Mitchnick, the head of digital assets at BlackRock, talked about the company's inclination toward Ethereum (ETH) & Solana (Sol) spot ETF plans.

Mitchnick said that the company filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF application in the last year because of the very high interest of clients. Many clients requested the fund manager to launch the Bitcoin spot ETF product in the last bull & bear phase.

On the Ethereum spot ETF, the BlackRock executive said that demand for ETH ETF was very little over Bitcoin and for other crypto ETFs was very very little.

When Mitchnick was asked if BlackRock will soon be introducing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on one of the hottest Solana meme coins at the moment, Dogewifhat (WIF). Mitchnick responded & said that he didn't know what it was. In this way, the BlackRock executive indirectly dismissed all kinds of speculations around the company's other crypto spot ETF applications.

In Nov 2023, BlackRock filed for an Ethereum spot ETF product and so far no decision has come to light by the SEC body.

According to ETF experts, there are huge chance that the decision on ETH ETF applications by the SEC body will come somewhere in May of this year.

uhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, led the UAE delegation participating in the Nuclear Energy Summit that was held for the first time on Thursday in the Belgian capital, Brussels.

It was organised and hosted by the Belgian government and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The UAE's participation in this summit reflects the global confidence in the UAE's effective role and its achievements in the implementation of nuclear energy projects in a short period of time. These achievements are role model to be emulated by countries interested in nuclear energy, and the UAE's important role in spreading clean energy technologies and solutions around the world was highlighted.

On the sidelines of the summit, Al Mazrouei met Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; Marisa Lago, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Kadri Simson, European Commissioner for Energy, and Rafael Mariano Grossi, IAEA Director General. Mohamed Al Sahlawi, the UAE Ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium, the European Union, and Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; and Hamad Ali Al Kaabi, UAE Permanent Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), attended the meetings.

The first ever Nuclear Energy Summit gathered world leaders to discuss how nuclear power can help drive sustainable development.

Co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo and the Director General of the IAEA Rafael Mariano Grossi, the Summit came in the wake of the historic inclusion of nuclear energy in the Global Stocktake agreed at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai in December 2023, which called for accelerating its deployment along with other low carbon energy sources. More than 25 countries launch declaration to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at COP28.

Leaders and representatives from 32 countries at the Nuclear Energy Summit backed measures in areas such as financing, technological innovation, regulatory cooperation and workforce training to enable the expansion of nuclear capacity to tackle climate change and boost energy security. The declaration also includes a commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, including small modular reactors worldwide while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security.

'' We, the leaders of countries operating nuclear power plants, or expanding or embarking on or exploring the option of nuclear power support enhancing efforts to facilitate mobilisation of public investments, where appropriate, and private investments towards additional nuclear power projects, according to summit's declaration.

The declaration adds: ""We commit to work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy by taking measures such as enabling conditions to support and competitively finance the lifetime extension of existing nuclear reactors, the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, including small modular reactor.''

''We reaffirm our strong commitment to nuclear energy as a key component of our global strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both power and industrial sectors, ensure energy security, enhance energy resilience, and promote long-term sustainable development and clean energy transition.

Having been mesmerized by her first total solar eclipse experience in 2017, she has purchased 1,200 branded pairs of solar eclipse glasses for her clients and friends. She recalls the awe-inspiring moment and the excitement of planning to witness the next celestial event at her brother's ranch, which will be in the path of totality.

However, the importance of purchasing safe solar eclipse glasses cannot be overstated. In 2017, unsafe eclipse glasses flooded the market, leading to issues for online retailers like Amazon. To ensure safety, it is crucial to buy glasses from trusted vendors approved by the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Richard Fienberg, project manager of the AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force, warns against purchasing glasses from unreliable sources, emphasizing the need for ISO compliance and proper testing.

As the April 8 eclipse approaches, Fienberg suggests testing eclipse glasses indoors to ensure they provide adequate protection from the sun. Customers should be cautious and verify the authenticity of their glasses to avoid any potential risks. Additionally, for those looking to obtain free eclipse glasses, various organizations such as the STAR Library Network and optometry offices are offering complimentary pairs.

During the eclipse, it is essential to wear solar eclipse glasses or viewers for the partial phases of the event to protect your eyes. Fienberg advises using caution and avoiding the use of other optical devices in conjunction with eclipse glasses. For those who have old eclipse glasses from previous events, they can still be used as long as they are in good condition and free from any damage.

For individuals without access to solar eclipse glasses, alternative viewing methods such as pinhole projection can provide a safe and enjoyable experience.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

If the thousands of proposed solar, wind and battery energy projects got built, they would more than double the amount of electricity that is currently produced nationwide and get the U.S. much closer to its clean energy targets.

But there's one big problem: America's power lines can't carry that much juice.

The country's limited transmission infrastructure is causing a huge backlog: Wait times for regulators to approve grid connections now last about five years on average, a figure that stood at less than two years in 2008.

""We have a ton of resources sitting in [backlogs] that can't get connected to the system,"" said Byron Corum, technical adviser to Commissioner Allison Clements, who serves on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ""One of the big reasons is we're running out of space on the transmission grid.""

Building new transmission lines to swoop across the nation's landscape can cost billions of dollars and require decades of permitting and construction. As that work continues, some policymakers are pushing an interim solution: squeezing more capacity out of existing power lines.

Grid-enhancing technologies, or GETs, are low-cost, quick-to-deploy devices that can help existing infrastructure carry up to 40% more electricity. Backers say these upgrades could bring a surge of clean energy projects online, even as future transmission lines remain under construction.

Congestion on the grid cost consumers more than $20 billion in 2022, one analysis found, a massive spike from just a few years before. Some lawmakers think technology upgrades could significantly lower utility bills in addition to their climate benefits.

""They are very cheap in terms of how much money they save for the grid when compared to creating new lines, which can be billions of dollars,"" said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

But many utilities have been slow to deploy GETs. In most states, utilities can charge higher rates based on investments they've made to improve infrastructure. That means expensive projects -- such as building new power lines -- deliver a much higher profit return than low-cost upgrades.

""Utilities are definitely biased toward building big, expensive projects where they get a solid return and make a bunch of money,"" said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. ""That's not what GETs is.""

In eight states, legislators have put forward bills that would force utilities to evaluate grid-enhancing technologies in the planning documents they are required to submit to state regulators. Backers believe those reports will demonstrate that GETs can meet capacity needs at the lowest cost to ratepayers, which would force utilities to adopt them under their regulatory mandates.

Some proponents believe further changes to utilities' incentive structure may be needed to ensure widespread use.

While GETs-related bills have not drawn specific pushback along partisan lines or from industry groups, backers acknowledge that challenges remain.

Grid-enhancing technologies come in several forms. One technology uses real-time temperature and wind measurements to determine how much power can pass through lines without overheating, enabling more electricity to flow when it's safe. Such ""dynamic line ratings"" would replace static systems that limit electricity flow based on conservative estimates of potential high temperatures.

New system controls can redirect power from congested lines to corridors that are less crowded. And software technology can evenly distribute electricity over a transmission network, preventing overloads and increasing capacity.

Taken together, these tools can dramatically increase the carrying capacity of existing power lines under certain conditions. They also can make the grid more resilient and less vulnerable to overloads and outages.

""It allows [renewable electricity] to get to the market more efficiently, and that helps with more affordability,"" said Sandra Jenkins, director of grid controls with the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity.

The department has spent more than $8 million on grid-enhancing research and demonstration projects across four regions.

Jenkins said one ongoing challenge is that grid operators will need to adopt a standardized system of collecting data, since the analytics-heavy technology could create accessibility headaches without a single set of guidelines.

Several state lawmakers said they were encouraged by a report published earlier this year by the climate-focused nonprofit RMI. Looking at a grid sector covering parts of the eastern United States, the authors found that GETs could allow an additional 6.6 gigawatts of clean energy to come online by 2027. That added capacity could power about 5 million homes while yielding $1 billion each year in production cost savings, with an installation cost of $100 million.

""GETs are incredibly fast and cost-effective,"" said Katie Siegner, a manager focused on grid policy within RMI's Carbon-Free Electricity practice. ""They can be deployed in months, compared to the decades it might take to site a new transmission line.""

Last year, Colorado became the first state to enact a law advancing grid-enhancing technologies. The measure, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Chris Hansen, requires utilities to study the potential of GETs before breaking ground on a new transmission line. Forcing utilities to consider those upgrades, Hansen said, should allow the state's fast-growing renewable energy sector to bring more power online.

""We've got to play catch-up,"" he said. ""We've got to make the investments now to get the system where it needs to be in the next decade.""

In Virginia, state lawmakers passed a bill late last month requiring utilities to study grid-enhancing technologies in their planning documents. The measure is awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

""We're making them take a close look and see if it makes sense,"" said state Del. Phil Hernandez, the bill's Democratic sponsor. ""Knowing the promise they hold, we hope we'll be able to nudge them in that direction.""

Hernandez said the bill did not face pushback from the state's utilities. While some lawmakers voted against the bill, they did not explain their objections during a Senate hearing on the proposal. Republican state Sen. Mark Obenshain, who also serves on the General Assembly's Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, did not respond to an inquiry about voting against the bill in committee or on its final passage.

Minnesota lawmakers are considering a similar bill this session. The measure, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Larry Kraft, would direct utilities to evaluate congestion on their networks by 2025 and determine how GETs could be used to address it. Like many of the states pursuing GETs legislation, Minnesota has a law requiring a shift to clean electricity in the coming years. Coupled with a growing demand for electric cars and heating systems, legislators expect the state's transmission needs to increase.

""This makes so much sense,"" Kraft said. ""We are expecting a lot more renewables on the grid, and GETs could be really helpful in certain cases.""

Kraft said the measure will likely be included in an omnibus bill at the end of the legislative session.

In a letter to Minnesota lawmakers, the regional utility Xcel Energy expressed its support for GETs and credited the bill with ""jump-starting"" a conversation. However, the utility noted that its infrastructure in Minnesota connects to a multistate grid. The full benefits of GETs, Xcel wrote, depend on a collaborative multistate process rather than a utility-by-utility plan. The letter noted other examples in which the larger regional transmission organization that Xcel is part of would need to be considered in plans to use such upgrades.

In Utah, Blouin's bill passed the Senate without objection, but did not get a vote on the House floor before the end of the legislative session. An earlier version of the measure would have allowed utilities to retain a portion of the savings generated by the deployment of GETs. Blouin and some advocates said that might incentivize utilities to pursue such upgrades, even as the new transmission lines that deliver larger profits remain under development.

The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners did not respond to an interview request. Neither Dominion Energy, which supplies electricity in Virginia and other states, nor the Edison Electric Institute, an association the represents electric companies, responded to interview requests by publication time.

Lawmakers in other states -- including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and South Carolina -- have proposed similar bills, mostly focused on requiring their utilities to study GETs and provide reports on how they could benefit their systems.

Though many of the measures have drawn bipartisan support, all but South Carolina's are sponsored by Democrats.

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various industries. One significant area where AI is making profound strides is in robotics, particularly in the realm of robot learning. This fusion of AI and robotics is not only reshaping the capabilities of robots but also redefining how they perceive, interact, and learn from their environment. Let's delve into the transformative impact of AI on the robot learning landscape.

Understanding Robot Learning

Robot learning encompasses the process by which robots acquire new knowledge and skills autonomously or with minimal human intervention. Traditionally, robots relied heavily on pre-programmed instructions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments. However, with advancements in AI, robots can now learn from experience, akin to human learning, through techniques such as reinforcement learning and deep learning.

The Role of AI in Robot Learning

AI serves as the backbone of robot learning, empowering robots with cognitive abilities to perceive and interpret their surroundings. Through machine learning algorithms, robots can analyze vast amounts of sensory data, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions in real-time. This capability enables robots to adapt to changing environments, navigate complex terrains, and perform intricate tasks with precision.

Enhanced Perception and Sensing

One of the key areas where AI is transforming robot learning is in perception and sensing. Modern robots are equipped with sophisticated sensors, including cameras, lidars, and tactile sensors, to perceive their surroundings. AI algorithms process this sensory information, allowing robots to recognize objects, detect obstacles, and assess environmental conditions accurately. This enhanced perception enables robots to operate safely in diverse settings, from factory floors to outdoor environments.

Adaptive Learning Algorithms

AI-driven adaptive learning algorithms lie at the heart of robot learning systems. These algorithms enable robots to continually refine their behavior based on feedback from their interactions with the environment. Through reinforcement learning, robots learn to associate actions with rewards or penalties, optimizing their decision-making processes over time. Similarly, deep learning algorithms enable robots to learn complex tasks by analyzing large datasets, such as images or sensor readings, and extracting meaningful insights.

Applications Across Industries

The integration of AI into robot learning has far-reaching implications across various industries. In manufacturing, AI-powered robots can automate repetitive tasks, improve production efficiency, and enhance quality control processes. In healthcare, robots equipped with AI capabilities can assist in surgical procedures, monitor patient vital signs, and provide personalized care services. Moreover, in logistics and transportation, AI-driven robots are revolutionizing warehouse operations, delivery services, and autonomous driving technologies.

Challenges and Future Directions

While AI holds immense potential for transforming the robot learning landscape, several challenges must be addressed to unlock its full capabilities. These include ensuring the safety and ethical use of AI-powered robots, mitigating biases in machine learning algorithms, and fostering human-robot collaboration in diverse settings. Moreover, ongoing research is focused on developing more robust and adaptable AI algorithms that can handle uncertainty, ambiguity, and complex decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion

As we look to the future, the synergy between AI and robotics promises to usher in a new era of innovation and progress. By harnessing the power of AI-driven robot learning, we can create intelligent machines that not only complement human abilities but also extend the boundaries of what is possible. From enhancing productivity and efficiency to improving quality of life and advancing scientific discovery, the potential applications of AI in robotics are limitless. As we continue to push the boundaries of technological innovation, let us embrace the transformative power of AI in shaping the future of robotics and beyond.

The promoters of this initiative, led by the group Mighty Earth, demand a plan to reduce these emissions, arguing that in these sectors hardly any efforts have been made to combat warming.

This proposal has been formulated in the allegations presented to the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, where the Administration sets out its objectives for the decarbonization of the economy.

Mighty Earth, an international organization recently established in Spain, proposes that the Government set itself the goal of reducing methane emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 2020.

The request is directed especially at the agricultural and livestock sector as they generate large quantities of methane, which is the second greenhouse gas in volume after carbon dioxide (CO2), and with a warming potential 86 times greater than this. in a 20 year cycle.

The agricultural and livestock sector is responsible for 11.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Spain (2021 data) and is responsible for 62.7% of the methane thrown into the atmosphere.

And, within this area, the main focuses are the enteric fermentation of herbivores (belches and wind of cattle, especially), as well as pig or chicken farms and manure management. The other big focus is landfills.

The promoters of this initiative recall that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been insisting on the need to reduce emissions of methane and other gases if the temperature increase is to be contained below 1.5ºC.

And Spain signed the Global Commitment on Methane at the Glasgow climate summit (2021), although countries have shifted action towards methane reductions in the hydrocarbon extraction and transportation sector (leak control and so on). .

""It is very good to act in the field of hydrocarbons, but it is also key to do so in the field of agriculture, livestock and waste,"" says Carlos Bravo, representative of Mighty Earth in Spain and expert in public policies.

In their proposal to reduce methane emissions, these entities propose a progressive reduction in meat production levels, the promotion of healthy diets (vegetarian or with lower meat or dairy content) and the promotion of vegetable proteins.

""The Spanish Food Safety Agency recommends moderate consumption of meat since its continued and/or excessive consumption is related to health problems,"" says Carlos Bravo, representatives of Mighty Earth in Spain.

""Several studies have shown that methane reduction could be more easily achieved if EU citizens changed their diet to one with less meat and dairy consumption following national guidelines, which would lead to a reduction in the volume of livestock in the U. "", adds Carlos Bravo. These policies could mean a reduction of between 29% and 37% of the sector's methane emissions, according to the aforementioned allegations presented.

In December of last year, the European Commission made an evaluation of the updated draft of the National Energy and Climate Plan (Pniec) of Spain, and underlined precisely the shortcomings that Mighty Earth now reveals.

The Commission already warned then that the Pniec ""does not provide information on the implementation schedule, nor on the sources of financing"" related to measures to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector.

In addition, it was pointed out that the plan ""does not pay attention to methane emissions from enteric fermentation"" in the agriculture and livestock sector, despite ""which constitutes the largest source of emissions other than CO2,"" he points out, pointing out to methane from cattle and sheep.

The ""insufficient effort"" of these sectors is also considered worrying, according to the content of the Spanish long-term strategy aimed at achieving climate neutrality in 2050.

The scenarios drawn for the middle of the century foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions not from energy use for the primary sector, specifically 53% compared to the reference years (1990).

Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development and the Pacific, on Sunday announced 17 million Australian dollars (11 million U.S. dollars) in funding for the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis -- also known as the TB Alliance.

The funding will support the TB Alliance's efforts to develop and trial a new generation of treatments for tuberculosis.

The announcement was made to coincide with World Tuberculosis Day.

Wong said in a joint statement with Conroy that it reaffirms Australia's steadfast commitment to ending tuberculosis.

""Improving the health and well-being of communities in Southeast Asia and the Pacific is central to supporting a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,"" she said.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis globally in 2022, 1.3 million of whom died.

In addition to developing new treatments, Wong and Conroy said the TB Alliance will help governments including those of the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea roll them out.

Grid connection signifies the delivery of the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity from the fourth reactor of the nuclear energy plant, marking a pivotal moment in the nation's clean energy transition and journey towards Net Zero by 2050.

Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of clean electricity capacity to power the national grid, representing another significant step forward towards full-fleet operations, further supporting the UAE's efforts in enhancing grid stability and energy security through abundant around-the-clock zero-emissions electricity.

The Nawah teams at Barakah have worked closely with the Abu Dhabi Transmission and Despatch Company (TRANSCO), a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PSJC (TAQA), who constructed the overhead lines to connect the Barakah Plant to the Abu Dhabi grid - ensuring the power generated at Barakah is safely, securely and reliably delivered to consumers across the country.

Grid connection of Unit 4 solidifies the Barakah Plant's position as the cornerstone of the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategy, contributing significantly to the nation's clean energy portfolio. It not only propels the UAE towards achieving its ambitious climate goals but also positions the country as a leader in nuclear energy and decarbonization. The operational readiness of all four units underscores the UAE's commitment to diversifying its energy sources, ensuring the reliability and sustainability of its energy sector for the next six decades.

Mohamed Al Hammadi, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ENEC, said: ""We are proud to have achieved another critical milestone for the Barakah Plant, which stands as a testament to the UAE's leadership in the development of large-scale multi-unit nuclear fleets. Grid connection of Unit 4 puts us well on the path to full-fleet commercial operations, and with that, the ability to generate 40TWh of clean, baseload electricity annually to drive our Net Zero economy, offering a competitive edge to many businesses, decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries, while presenting a global benchmark for the entire nuclear energy industry.""

The fourth unit is nearing the start of commercial operations. Following grid connection, Unit 4 will undergo the process of gradually raising power levels, known as Power Ascension Testing (PAT). The process will be continuously monitored and tested until maximum electricity production is reached, while adhering to all local regulatory requirements and the highest international standards of safety, quality and security.

Each Unit has been connected to the grid more efficiently than the previous unit, as institutional knowledge and experience are applied to each subsequent unit. Unit 3 was delivered four months faster than the Unit 2 schedule, and five months faster than the Unit 1 schedule, demonstrating the significant benefit of building multiple units within a phased timeline.

Backed by the success of the Barakah Plant, ENEC is at the forefront of pioneering initiatives aimed at shaping the future of clean energy. ENEC's focus on advancing nuclear technologies, across large-scale PWR reactors through to Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and microreactors through the ENEC ADVANCE Program, aims to further strengthen the UAE's leadership in climate action and clean energy transition. This strategic direction not only amplifies the UAE's contributions to global decarbonization efforts but also showcases the potential of advanced nuclear technologies in meeting the world's growing energy needs sustainably.",eyeofriyadh.com,news,eyeofriyadh.com,,0.6941176470588235,448964214,1,https://www.eyeofriyadh.com/news_images/2024/03/35e09a04689b4.jpeg,

That essay evolved into a 2018 book and became the basis for Haidt's new line of work investigating child and teen mental health.

In his new book, ""The Anxious Generation,"" Haidt presents a broader theory of why an epidemic of mental illness in kids has bloomed since 2010 -- namely the transition from a ""play-based childhood"" to a ""phone-based childhood,"" a phenomenon he calls the ""Great Rewiring.""

Since the 1990s, he says, in-person, physical childhood play and interaction with friends, childhood independence, and unstructured time have all been declining. Instead, he argues, children today mostly mediate relationships and play through a screen. The average teen spends five hours a day on social media sites, not including time spent on screens for school, work, or other activities. The result? Teens now spend just 30 to 60 minutes a day in person with friends, down from two hours a day on average before 2010.

A life lived online, Haidt argues, is just not the same as a flesh-and-blood one. And it's harming a whole generation of kids.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Your book examines the reasons why children and teens have been experiencing high rates of depression and anxiety. But you actually set out to write a different book, right? What happened?

I got a contract to write a book called ""Life After Babel: Adapting to a World We May Never Again Share,"" and it's about how social media makes it difficult to have a shared reality, and without shared reality, it's very hard to have a stable democracy. My main work has been on politics, morality, and emotion, but I had this side project that came out of ""The Coddling of the American Mind"" looking at what's going on with Gen Z. And so I thought chapter one would be showing how social media had scrambled teens' social lives, and then the rest of the book would be about what it had done to democracy. But once I wrote the first chapter, I realized what is happening to kids is horrifying, and I can't just say, ""Oh, look, the mental health of a generation is falling off a cliff. Now let's move on to democracy.""

How is youth mental health related to these larger issues of democratic health and political polarization?

One thing to keep in mind is that social media has pushed politics and polarization down into middle school. It's pushed political activism down into middle school. Middle school kids should not be marinated in culture issues or threats to themselves, to society, and the world. They have major developmental tasks to do. They need to develop their social skills. They need to develop basic competencies. They should be insulated from the craziness of America's adult political life. But they're not.

How is what you call the ""Great Rewiring"" playing into all of this?

What I call the ""Great Rewiring"" of childhood is basically the complete transformation of what kids are doing with their days, how they're interacting with other kids, and of what [information] they're consuming.

There's no single human childhood experience around the world. But wherever you go, children want to play with each other. Children need play for their development. But one of the strangest changes to childhood began to happen here in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We began cracking down on unsupervised play and childhood independence, and pulling kids indoors because we thought the outside was too dangerous. Fewer people know their neighbors, and parenting has become more intensive. That's the backstory, but it's not the whole story.

Then the internet arrived. It didn't really affect millennials' mental health that much: Access wasn't universal, there were no smartphones, and internet speeds were slow.

And then a lot of things happened in rapid succession between 2010 and 2015. The smartphone becomes ubiquitous, and what [kids] do with their time changes radically in just a few years. Instead of playing at each other's houses in person, everything is now going through the phone.

Let's talk about TikTok. Congress is pushing for the Chinese company ByteDance to divest from TikTok, and a lot of people are afraid that could mean a US ban on the platform altogether. Setting aside the national security concerns of the app's Chinese ownership, what are your concerns about TikTok's mental health effects on young people?

I'm in support of a ban from a national security viewpoint. From a health perspective there are many reasons to think TikTok is much worse than any other platform, although I wouldn't necessarily support a ban for adults on social media. The main one is that TikTok comes the closest to what we psychologists call ""behaviorist conditioning"" of any platform ever invented. Behaviorist conditioning was discovered by psychologists in the 1930s and '40s -- they found that if you can give someone a small reward very quickly, you can make them do all kinds of things. Think about watching a dog or circus trainer at work. All social media platforms give these tiny little doses of pleasure to reinforce, reinforce, and reinforce again the behavior they want to see: tapping and swiping. But TikTok does this more powerfully than any other platform.

Young people themselves say it is the most addictive of all the platforms and a net negative contribution to society. A University of Chicago study found that individual students would actually pay the researchers to get all of their peers to shut down Instagram and TikTok. But they felt pressure to keep their accounts going if everyone else does. If they were the only ones deactivating their accounts for a month, the students wanted to be paid $50. It turns out most students were on these platforms only because everyone else was. Students told the researchers that the world would be better if TikTok was never invented.

That is the most damning evidence I can imagine against TikTok, and Instagram for that matter. They are sucking up billions of hours a year of people's time and spreading mental illness.

But there are a number of people, both kids and adults, who appear to be defending TikTok. Many say the app has given them a space for community and creativity.

First of all, social media is a very powerful tool that adults can use to achieve their goals. Photographers use Instagram for all sorts of business reasons. I would never suggest a ban on Instagram, and I would be very reluctant to tell adults that they cannot do what they want to do online. That would also be a good argument for allowing adults to get on TikTok as long as it wasn't unduly influenced by the Communist Party in China.

The whole argument in my book is that children are different from adults. Children are uniquely vulnerable neurologically as they go through puberty -- especially during early puberty. Children need to be having real-world interactions. And TikTok is the most powerful tool ever found to keep them glued to a screen.

What you say in your book is that we need to keep kids away from screens for as long as possible. Phone-free schools, no smartphones before high school, no social media accounts before 16. What is the single most important obstacle to making those things happen?

The big obstacle is that these are all collective action problems. When we contemplate any one of these things as individuals, they seem hopelessly difficult. If you're the only parent that keeps your kid off social media, it's difficult.

But if we all do them at the same time, then it becomes much easier. I actually do think that childhood is going to change by the end of 2025. Schools are already going phone-free. Norms are going to change so that we can get middle school kids just phones instead of smartphones. And I think a consensus will emerge that social media is really bad for children. I think we will see both legal efforts and parental efforts to delay entry until 16. So I think those three norms are actually relatively easy to implement.

The more difficult part will be giving kids far more independence, free play, and responsibility. That is also a collective action problem, because if you're the only one who is sending your kid out to the store to get a quart of milk by themselves when they are 8 years old, you could get arrested. Parents really are afraid of what's going to happen to their children if they take their eyes off them. We really have to change parental attitudes. Which is hard. But to some extent, if you do reduce the role that screens play in kids' lives, then there might be more willingness to give kids more independence.

If we're reducing access to screens, we have to give them a lot more access to each other. We have to give them a lot more time together. And that's going to take a lot more work for parents and schools. But let's say, for example, if every elementary school would simply open their playgrounds for an hour before school starts and for a couple of hours after school -- all you need is one adult who is nearby, not supervising, but just in case there's a problem. It's a physically safe place where kids can do things that might even sometimes be emotionally unsafe, like teasing each other. That would be incredibly beneficial for their development. And it's a lot more fun than piano or language lessons.",bostonglobe.com,news,The Boston Globe,,0.03529411764705892,448964065,1,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/oY6qLmua80tqm0WtAhWtTtrx4vU=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/SJX7TKKCWZC25KSHLMBA4YOVYE.jpg,eng-9417105

Droplet generation requires two immiscible fluids that act as a continuous phase and a dispersed phase. The two phases are carried in separate channels and are made to interact at a junction where they make an interface. Further fluid interaction causes the interface to deform under the shear stresses that initialize interfacial instabilities and finally result into continuous phase pinching off a drop of dispersed phase in a continuous fashion (Christopher and Anna 2007; Liu and Zhang 2011). Conventionally, these fluids are pumped into the microchannels either by (i) mechanical pressure (using pressure controllers or hydrostatic heads) (Bong et al. 2011) or (ii) positive displacement of fluid (using syringe pumps) (Zhu and Wang 2016). These methods not only provide a fine control over the flow rates of individual streams but also maintain the high pressures required during such fluid-flow operations. However, these methods come with some limitations. The cost associated with the two mentioned methods is considerably high and they also have a large footprint that hampers the mobility of the device. This in-turn reduces their applicability as point of care and diagnostic devices. The high reagent volumes required in these methods can also be a problem when using costly or limited reagents. The high pressures that accumulates within the channel during operation challenge the bonding of the fabricated layers and sometimes results in delamination and leaks in the device. Lastly, with multiple parameters to control, such devices require trained personals or high level of instrumentation control at some point of operation.

In this work, we characterized and optimized suction-based microfluidics as an accessible and significantly economical method for droplet generation to overcome the limitations of conventional microfluidic approach. The basic requirements for any microfluidic droplet generation device are: (i) driving force that induces the fluid-flow and (ii) a specific ratio between the flow rates of continuous and dispersed phase that insures the droplet generation (Zhu and Wang 2016). In this study, we use negative pressure or suction through the exit as the driving force for all operations, and control the flow rate ratio by the geometry of the primary channels i.e., the inlet channels (Abate and Weitz 2011; Panwar and Roy 2019). The suction is generated by the feedback-controlled pull-back of an empty syringe that generated enough suction pressure to drive the flow of dispersed and continuous phases. The geometry of the device enables the two fluids to interact at the required flow rate ratios resulting in droplet generation.

The primary objective of this study is to identify a governing parameter that can define droplet volume (V) and the droplet generation regime as a function of control variables. These variables include device geometry (length of dispersed and continuous phase inlet channels), fluid properties (viscosity, μ of both phases and interfacial tension, γ) and flow properties (velocity, v of phases before flow focusing junction). Such a governing parameter can help standardize flow-focusing droplet generator as a unit operation. The study also serves as a prerequisite to design suction-driven microfluidic devices with multiple unit operation where available suction pressure (limited to ~ 100 kPa) and each integrated operation has to be optimized for its pressure consumption. As flow rate control in individual channels is not possible in suction-based microfluidic platforms, characterizing droplet generation as a unit operation becomes pertinent.

Controlled droplet generation has many industrial applications and hence it has been extensively studied to understand droplet generation dynamics and its relation with flow parameters. To understand the droplet pinch-off in microfluidic channels, it is important to examine the local viscous stresses and the dynamic pressure field surrounding the emerging droplet. A few dimensionless numbers are used to express the relationship between viscous stresses and pressure fields. Most common among them is the capillary number (Ca) which characterizes the ratio of viscous stresses and capillary pressure.

Here G is the characteristic rate of strain and n is the characteristic size of the neck before the pinch-off (Stone 1994). The subscripts D and C are used to represent dispersed and continuous phase respectively. The other important dimensionless numbers are the viscosity ratio (λ) and flow rate ratio (\(\varphi \)).

Based on these fundamentals, there have been a few efforts to capture V mathematically. The earlier studies stated that droplets are formed when viscous stresses overcome the interfacial tension or when Ca tends to unity where the droplet diameter (d) was expressed as follows (Thorsen et al. 2001):

Here ϵ is the shear rate within the junction. The expression did not consider the relation between flow rates (Q) of the different phases. The subsequent studies provide a model to predict the droplet size based on the force balance (Eqs. 5 and 6) (Husny and Cooper-White 2006). It should be noted that the authors did not account for the viscous stresses from the dispersed phase that contribute to the resistance to deformation along with the interfacial tension.

Here d* = d/D is the droplet diameter scaled by continuous phase channel's hydraulic diameter, α is the ratio of effective cross section area of two channels, C is the correction factor incorporating the viscosity ratio and ω represents the ratio of droplet velocity to the average velocity of the continuous phase. The model predicts that the droplet size is only a function of Ca and is independent of flow rate ratio. The model however, does not report a strong quantitative agreement with the experimental findings (Xu et al. 2006). Even with these different considerations and hypothesis, both of the discussed models agree on the point that droplet pinch-off in a cross-flow geometry is dominated by the viscous drag in the dripping regime. Squeezing regime, on the other hand, is defined by the intervention of geometry (Garstecki et al. 2006, 2005). It was found that in squeezing regime, V is a strong function of geometry and Ca (Eq. 7) (Graaf et al. 2006).

Here V is the droplet volume before the breaking is initiated and t is the time between initiation of breaking and collapse of neck. V and t are calculated at Ca = 1 and n and m are channel geometry dependent parameters. Even though this model accounts for dispersed phase flow rate, without the inclusion of viscosity ratio, it cannot account for the viscosity of dispersed phase. These models indicated that increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase liquid results in decreased droplet size especially in dripping regime due to increased viscous drag and thus shear forces on the interface (Husny and Cooper-White 2006; Xu et al. 2006). It was also found that at a viscosity ratio of ~ 1, the transition from dripping to squeezing regime occurs at Ca ~ 0.015 (Menech et al. 2008). In another model, it was proposed that V and droplet diameter (d) depends upon continuous phase flow rate (Q) and Ca when dispersed phase flow rate is constant (Eqs. 8 and 9) (Lee et al. 2009). According to this model, the transition from squeezing regime is a function of microchannel dimension.

However, these models lack the contribution from the dispersed phase viscosity and velocity in droplet generation. Another point to note here is that all these studies were conducted over droplet generation in T-junction channels and not on the flow-focusing junction which is more widely used in the bioanalysis community in recent times (Zilionis et al. 2017; Jonghe et al. 2023). Empirical relationship between scaled V and continuous phase Ca has also been proposed for flow-focusing junction but they too lack the contribution from dispersed phase and channel geometry as seen in Eq. 10 where d in droplet length and w is channel width (Sontti and Atta 2020).

A compelling argument was proposed by Cubaud and Mason (2008), where both dispersed phase and continuous phase capillary numbers were found to be significant in defining droplet pinch-off dynamics along with the role of flow rate ratios. However, it did not provide a governing relationship that could comprehensively corelate V with the two capillary numbers as well as the device geometry. In our study, we attempted to bridge this gap by identifying and incorporating the role of dispersed phase viscosity and flow rate in the interfacial dynamics of droplet generation in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. To standardize droplet generation in suction microfluidics, we provide a simple yet effective model that outlines the design and driving force requirements for droplet generation and its corresponding regimes.",link.springer.com,news,Springer,,-0.1058823529411764,448963950,1,https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10404-024-02714-2/MediaObjects/10404_2024_2714_Fig1_HTML.png,

The Exiles were edged out in a scrappy encounter at Holker Street after Cole Stockton's finish in the 20th minute.

The striker was found in space inside the area by former County finisher Dom Telford and he made no mistake, drilling past Nick Townsend.

The Exiles failed to ramp up the pressure on the Bluebirds after the break - manager Graham Coughlan labelled the performance as ""cr*p"" - with Paul Farman having just one save of note to make, palming Seb Palmer-Houlden's strike away.

Here are some talking points after the clash in Cumbria...

County paid the price for not making the most of having the wind at their backs in the first half in Wrexham before Christmas and this time they failed in the second 45.

The Exiles were pinned back in the first half and failed to hold up the ball, with Palmer-Houlden guilty of giving away too many cheap free-kicks with his youthful exuberance.

They had no platform - one of those games where Omar Bogle is missed? - but in truth they would have been not too disheartened to be 1-0 down after Barrow failed to seriously ramp up the pressure.

The Bluebirds were arguably better after the break and their experience up front showed, giving the hosts the chance to get the ball down in midfield rather than slamming it up in the air and then back-pedalling.

Barrow are used to the meteorological challenges of Holker Street and it showed as they created the better chances in the second half.

Flat County, who lacked their usual snap and fire, failed to build up a head of steam and were poor with their accuracy to the front line and wasteful when they did get in the final third.

PRESSURE: Lewis Payne snaps away for County at Barrow (Image: Huw Evans Agency)

Kyle Jameson, on the left of the three and recently back from injury, was County's only first-choice defender in Cumbria.

Scot Bennett has moved back from midfield through necessity and done well while Matt Baker's absence duty to Wales Under-21s duty led to Harrison Bright getting a chance on the right.

It was a tough task for the 20-year-old from Blaenavon, who had never started in League Two and had last been in a County XI at Swindon in the EFL Trophy in November, 2021.

Added to that, Bright is a right-back by trade and he slotted into a side in which no player managed a performance above a 5/10.

The academy graduate was clanger-free but a little wasteful in possession - into the breeze he produced a lovely ball for Aaron Wildig to lob wide but he failed to adjust to the wind being at his back - and his pass accuracy was just 42 per cent.

Time will tell if Bright remains at the club next season but after a reasonable effort he will hope for another opportunity in the run-in, perhaps at the expense of Southampton prospect Lewis Payne in his proper position.

County, meanwhile, must assess whether they need more defensive options for next season; has it purely been misfortune or do they have a lack of durability?

Jameson had a long spell out, Ryan Delaney, James Clarke and Josh Seberry, who really grasped his Football League opportunity until a broken leg at Notts County, are currently sidelined, while injury-plagued Declan Drysdale is on the comeback trail again.

Baker will be back from international duty for Colchester on Good Friday.

Every cloud and all that - County are mathematically safe in a season where many of us were fearing a relegation scrap.

They will soon get the three points needed to beat last season's tally of 57, which is Coughlan's motivation tool.

But on what felt like League Two moving day, with Wrexham, Stockport and Mansfield tlooking good for the top three and MK Dons and Crewe faltering, the surprise bid for the play-offs looks to be a long shot.

That's not really down to the disappointment in Barrow - it was always going to be a tough game regardless of performance - but the result from Tranmere.

Crawley, who were mightily impressive when beating the Exiles 4-1 in a September heatwave, left Prenton Park with three points.

That was as big a statement of intent as the Exiles' success at AFC Wimbledon.

The Reds are now four points ahead of County and have a game in hand, although there are twists and turns ahead.

The Exiles travel to Colchester on Good Friday when Crawley host in-form Doncaster, then they meet at Rodney Parade.

The Reds then travel to Mansfield and Wrexham, so there is still hope of catching them, but that Bank Holiday Monday clash really needs to be one of at least five wins from the Exiles' last seven.

It's worth remembering Coughlan's comments in mid-February: ""If people get excited and carried away then I don't want them to get too disappointed if it doesn't come off.""

After Chesterfield secured one of 24 spots in the fourth tier by claiming the National League title on Saturday, the Easter fixtures will go a long way towards determining whether the Exiles will face the Spireites.

County are at least the equal of their play-off contenders when on it but they cannot afford any more off days.

By Yi Whan-woo

The government will introduce a set of measures this week to revamp weakened private spending to achieve a growth target of 2.2 percent this year, the Ministry of Economy and Finance said Sunday.

The ministry plans to establish a fund worth 300 billion won ($222.8 million) to encourage investment in rural areas.

The fund will be launched, Monday, in cooperation with the Korea Development Bank and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety-run fund operator, which is tasked with salvaging small towns hit by a demographic crisis.

On Thursday, the finance ministry will also unveil a plan aimed at easing regulations and simplifying steps for businesses nationwide to receive state support in a timely manner when needed.

Separately, the ministry plans to encourage builders to beef up infrastructure investment in rural areas.

The government's moves come as domestic demand is faltering worse than expected, fueling concerns that it can offset the positive economic impact stemming from a recent recovery in exports.

A twin engine growth, exports increased for the fifth consecutive month in February, with outbound shipments advancing 4.8 percent year-on-year to $52.4 billion compared to inbound shipments that slid 13.1 percent year-on-year to $48.1 billion.

In particular, the trade balance with China, Korea's top trading partner, swung back to black for the first in 17 months as demand for chips, cars, petrochemical products and other key items increased.

On the other hand, the business survey index (BSI), a measurement linked to domestic demand, continued to remain sluggish.

According to the Bank of Korea (BOK), the BSI for all industries was measured at 69 for the second straight month in February.

A reading below 100 means pessimists outnumber optimists.

The February figure is the lowest since September 2020, when it was at 64.

In its forecast for 2024 economic growth, the finance ministry projected that private spending will grow 1.8 percent while exports will grow 8.5 percent.

Such a growth goal for private spending assumes that inflation will continue to ease so that goods are offered at affordable prices, according to economic experts.

Consumer prices, however, rose 3.1 percent year-on-year in February, bouncing back above 3 percent again after marking a 2.8 percent increase in January, according to Statistics Korea.

As part of Bitcoin Investor Day, billionaire Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, shared his views on the future of demand for Bitcoin and predicted a significant increase in the next decade.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Scaramucci cited several factors that contributed to this prediction.

The event, which includes individual investors and important corporate participants, aims to make Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience. Scaramucci stated that the change in Bitcoin demand dynamics, especially with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC and the halving event planned to be held at the end of April, has turned from an individual boom to corporate comfort.

The halving event, scheduled for around the 20th or 22nd of April, will effectively halve the daily supply of new Bitcoin entering the market and could potentially lead to a surge in prices. Scaramucci emphasized the potential impact of this event on market dynamics and said he foresees a significant increase in demand.

However, Scaramucci also acknowledged the unpredictability of market movements, citing the unexpected halving of Grayscale's BTC holdings two months after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. He attributed this phenomenon to factors such as bankruptcy trustees flooding the market with GBTC and retail investors seeking lower fees from ETF products.

Discussing the broader economic landscape, Scaramucci cited Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz's views on the upcoming wealth transfer, saying the $84 trillion owned by U.S. baby boomers is expected to pass on to younger generations. He likened Bitcoin adoption to technological trends, suggesting that younger demographic groups are more inclined to adopt digital assets.

Scaramucci said he was bullish on the future of Bitcoin, citing $1 million Bitcoin predictions from names like Michael Novogratz and Cathie Wood. Scaramucci believes that even if Bitcoin does not reach such astronomical levels, it can establish itself as a digital gold standard.

As the conversation shifted to Bitcoin's role in political discourse, Scaramucci suggested that both political parties in the US may need to embrace cryptocurrencies to avoid offending the millions of voters who own Bitcoin.",en.bitcoinsistemi.com,news,Bitcoin Sistemi,Mete Demiralp,0.2941176470588236,448963658,1,https://www.bitcoinsistemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/scaramucci.jpg,

The focus is on deregulation of electricity retail markets and on the continued regulation of parts of such markets after the introduction of competition. The first essay is an empirical essay on the causes of deregulation. The timing of implementation of competition in retail electricity markets in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand is studied. One conclusion is that there exist important qualitative differences between the United States and Europe. While deregulation in the United States to a large extent seems to have been driven by consumer interest concerns, the influence from interest groups is more pronounced in Europe.The second (theoretical) and third (empirical) essays deal with the interaction between the regulation of distribution networks and the retail market. When the regulated and unregulated operations are conducted within vertically integrated companies the regulation may not only have an effect on the regulated market, but also affect the behavior in the unregulated market. In the third essay a test that uses prices to detect patterns of cross-subsidization is developed and used on Norwegian data. Especially the effects of a regulatory change on cross-subsidization behavior are analyzed. The results both highlight the importance of a well-designed regulation of the regulated market and give support to requirements of vertical separation between regulated and unregulated operations.The fourth essay is a study of domestic electricity demand. It is thus somewhat different than the other papers since it is not directly connected to the issue of electricity market deregulation. Since the energy sector is an essential part of any modern economy and energy production has considerable environmental effects, the sector has for a long time been subject to political interventions. To some extent the policy instruments available to the legislator are reduced by deregulations. The use of taxes to affect prices and thus the demand for electricity may at the same time become an even more important policy instrument and more difficult to implement due to the internationalization of the electricity market.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.223529411764706,448963603,1,,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (Kepco).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a US$20 billion contract won by a Kepco-led consortium in 2009. The project marked Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, Kepco said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" Kepco chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.

Of course, manufacturers are doing everything they can to improve the situation, they are constantly trying to reduce consumption and of course they are installing huge, lead-heavy batteries in their new models.

However, as usual, Mazda takes a different approach. Rather, the small Japanese manufacturer halved the already not very large axle and installed a gasoline tank and a special Wankel engine in the remaining space.

You can find out how well a recipe similar to the BMW i3 with the range extender function works in practice at the end of our article - the new Mazda MX-30 R-EV is being tested.

Disguised

Externally, the MX-30 R-EV differs only minimally from the MX-30 EV, which we have already tested extensively and compared with the sister model of the CX-30 with a traditional combustion engine.

At first glance it is not possible to tell which MX-30 is in front of us. Small tell-tale signs on the side include the planetary piston logo next to the front wheel arch, the fuel cap cover on the left side and the e-Skyactiv R-EV logo on the back, indicating the new drive type.

In addition, two new alloy wheels appeared in the range, which are slightly lighter and have lower aerodynamic resistance than the versions previously offered and in the case of the Edition R model, which is produced in limited numbers - and which can also be seen in the attached photos - the unique black/deep red paint is new.

The Edition R also features a unique key, a backrest with an embossed logo and a special carpet with a chrome logo.

Japanese bunker

There is a special door solution that opens similar to closet doors, which looks great but is not a very practical solution. The rear windows cannot be lowered, the space in the rear could be better and the rear view is quite limited when reversing. In addition, there is neither an air inlet nor a USB socket for the rear seats.

Apart from the specific contents of the dashboard, the passenger compartment has not changed compared to the base model. The quality is above average, the ergonomics quite excellent, but the large center console steals a lot of space and it is strange why such a large mechanical gear lever is installed in a car without a gearbox.

The traditional push-button steering wheel is very easy to grip and the strength of the recuperation or engine braking can be adjusted in five levels using the knobs behind it. The digital instrument cluster isn't really customizable, the user interface on the thin infotainment display is a bit old-fashioned, but the digital climate panel mounted above the center console feels very high-tech.

The luggage compartment still holds 350-1155 liters, which doesn't sound bad at first, although we have to add that the trunk of the CX-30, which has similar external dimensions, also holds 430-1406 liters of goodness. And if you also order the high-quality Bose hi-fi system, the size of the trunk is reduced even further.

A new feature is the socket in the luggage compartment, which can be used to operate up to 1,500 W of electrical consumers. This means we can operate a coffee machine, but also a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer, from the car, if that's how our lives go.

Exotic gasoline

In contrast to the EV version, the front of the MX-30 R-EV, which can be understood as an electric car with a range extension function or as a serial plug-in hybrid, no longer has a large gap because the extremely compact one was relatively light Wankel engine installed.

It is worth remembering that Mazda launched its first Wankel model, the Cosmo Sport, in 1967 and by 2012 it had sold about 2 million cars with this engine.

The Wankel drive, which combines relatively small size and weight with high performance, was out of the range for more than 10 years, but now it's back and basically uses less petrol/oil than before and hopefully there won't be any more complaints about its reliability.

The conclusion is: Unlike conventional combustion engines, this time the piston does not move up and down, but rather performs a special rotational movement in a specially shaped cylinder.

Mazda has always loved such and similar special solutions, just think of the recently introduced Skyactiv-X engine, which tries to combine the advantages of petrol and diesel engines in a unique way, without a turbo.

He never drives

The 830 cubic centimeter single-disc petrol engine installed in the MX-30 produces 75 hp and 117 Nm of torque, but never directly drives the front wheels.

The development of the brand new engine with direct injection and exhaust gas recirculation, 11.9:1 compression and 20 percent higher efficiency than its predecessor presented the developers with major challenges, which is why the technology was delayed by 1-2 years in any case. According to the promises, there will be no There may be problems with durability.

The battery's gross capacity was essentially halved from 35.5 to 17.8 kWh and the free space was expanded to include a 50 liter fuel tank. The planetary piston motor only functions as a generator, generating electricity for the electric motor with 170 hp and 260 Nm of torque.

In comparison, the Hitachi electric motor in the purely electric version produces 145 hp and 270 Nm.

How do you play music?

When you press the start button, the new Mazda always starts in electric mode, in EV mode only the electric motor works, except in idle situations.

In normal mode, the R-EV also behaves like an electric car, but when the battery charge drops to 45 percent, it automatically begins switching the Wankel on and off. In charging mode, the petrol engine continuously charges the battery; the desired charge level can be set between 20 and 100 percent in 10 percent increments.

The engineers originally thought of a fixed speed solution, but by pressing the accelerator pedal, which supports the driving experience a little better, the speed changer became variable within certain limits. The speed of the crankshaft fluctuates between 2,000 and 4,500, and incomparable rolling noises penetrate the interior.

There's a bit of a dusty opening, a bit of three-cylinder or two-stroke scooter organ, but no one should expect heartwarming petrolhead music. Of course, if anyone would have expected such a vehicle.

Due to the slightly higher power, the compensation time for the 0-100 sprint has dropped from 9.7 to 9.1 seconds, the latest MX-30 is very maneuverable in the city and overtaking maneuvers on the motorway can be completed quickly and safely.

The top speed, which is limited to 140 km/h, has not changed, but it could have been increased a little. 150-160, God forbid, we would be a little happier with a top speed of 180.

A smaller battery here or there, the total weight increased with the introduction of the petrol engine: instead of 1720, the scale now weighs 1853 kilograms. In any case, the R-EV covers the weight, which is half a ton higher than the CX-30, quite well; the steering and chassis are absolutely up to date and have traditional Mazda values.

Range? Money?

Mazda promises a total range of around 680 kilometers, well above the 200 kilometers of the purely electric version. The battery, which can be described as compact not only compared to electric cars, but also compared to plug-in hybrids, enables an emission-free journey of 85 kilometers on paper, plus an additional range of almost 600 kilometers using fossil fuels.

That's the theory, but now comes our practical experience, which we gained in early spring weather of 10-15 degrees at an average pace.

With a fully charged battery, we managed to drive 65 kilometers purely electrically, after which we used the car in normal hybrid mode. In the end, we measured an average consumption of 3.9 liters and 16.7 kWh on the 140 kilometer long mixed route.

Then we set off on a 20-kilometer stretch of city-only terrain with an empty battery, which of course isn't really practical, but situations like this can happen. We completed this stage with an average consumption of 5.7 liters and 13.1 kWh per 100 kilometers.

The gasoline and electricity consumption figures would not be bad individually and/or in proportion, but in such a combined form they are not the real ones. And the range also falls somewhat short of our expectations at around 460 kilometers.

The maximum power of DC charging has been reduced from 50 to 36 kW, but a quick charge from 20 to 80 percent is still possible in 25 minutes because the battery is very small. On the AC front, the standard MX-30's power has recently dropped from 6.6 to 11 kW. In this case, charging from 20 to 80 percent takes about 50 minutes.

Petrol can be ""filled up"" at the rear left and electrical energy at the rear right.

Conclusion, prices

The Mazda MX-30 R-EV is best suited to anyone who would primarily use their car on shorter city trips but would rarely travel hundreds of miles.

The electric Mazda with Wankel drive puts an end to the range couple, but we pay the price in the form of the not-so-pleasant engine sound, the fuel consumption that exceeds expectations and the higher weight.

Also a bit at the checkout, because contrary to what was previously promised, the R-EV will not cost as much as the EV version. The price difference is not big, but depending on the version, the version that can also run on gasoline costs HUF 100,000 to HUF 300,000 more.

While the standard MX-30 costs 13.5 million forints, its longer-range sibling starts at 13.6 million forints, and the price of the limited edition R we received is a hefty 16 million forints.

If you can afford it with a traditional petrol engine and/or want more practical passenger/luggage space, then Mazda's CX-30 is still the crossover for us, starting at HUF 11.1 million with 122 hp and a manual gearbox , and for you can get away with an automatic transmission for 11.8 million HUF.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,0.1607843137254903,448963164,1,,

The wind power project, located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from capital Dhaka, is invested by Wuling Power Corp., a subsidiary of China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC), and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp..

Upon full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households.

Md. Abdul Kader Goni, the executive engineer of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told Xinhua that Bangladesh entered the era of first commercial wind power with the establishment of the wind power plant at Cox's Bazar.

Hei Zhao, general manager of Bangladesh division of Wuling Power Corp., said this is the first time that Chinese enterprises have introduced wind power into Bangladesh as investors, filling the gap in the wind power field in Bangladesh.

""During the construction of the project, we used Chinese solutions, Chinese standards and Chinese equipment to promote the sustainable development of Bangladesh's renewable energy industry, while training the first batch of practical talents in the field of wind power for Bangladesh and providing more than 1,500 local jobs,"" he added.

Manik Ahamed, the Bangladeshi engineer of the project, said that Bangladesh needs this kind of energy. ""I have learned a lot from this project, such as how to produce more energy with wind and how to safely produce electricity in the grid of Bangladesh. It's hoped that I can do more for our power and energy development.""

""Now, the cooperation of the two countries in the energy field under the Belt and Road Initiative has achieved fruitful outcomes such as this first-ever wind power project in Cox's Bazar. In the future, we hope that we can have more and more highly qualified cooperation like this to contribute to our energy field development,"" Goni stressed. ■",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.192156862745098,448963120,12,,

The minister of Power, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, while speaking on this development said, one of the considerations is to mop up available meters assembled in-country and incentivize indigenous meter manufacturers to enhance their plant capacities to meet demand structure of the Presidential Metering Initiative(PMI).

Adelabu said, President Bola Tinubu has instructed that Nigeria's import dependency would be significantly minimised before it would eventually be ended.

The minister, who was on a working visit and inspection tour of Mojec Group, a major stakeholder in the power sector said, in addition to repositioning the meter production sector, a new Bill to promote local content implementation in the power sector is being perfected for consideration by the National Assembly.

He said, importation of goods, especially, smart prepaid meters is inimical to national development, employment generation and economic growth and that 90 per cent of the current hardship in Nigeria was caused by the country's import dependence.

The minister further said, the PMI is making move to embark on bulk procurement of smart meters, the development of indigenous Meter Data Management Systems (MDMS), and the reduction of Aggregated Technical and Commercial (ATC&C) losses to improve efficiency and reliability of the energy infrastructure in Nigeria.

He said, though the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) is not presently considering special intervention options because of issues arising from previous uncoordinated interventions but he is in talks with CBN to consider the dire demand of the sector and provide the necessary support for local meter manufacturers.

Earlier, group managing director of MOJEC Group, Chantelle Abdul said, Nigeria will face serious energy challenges in the next two decades except proactive measures are considered to deal with seeming problems being presented by the sector.

Abdul said, the anticipated local content drive being advocated by the minister will go a long way to strengthen local manufacturers who are in need of intervention by government.

She informed the minister that despite bank guarantees by Electricity Distribution Companies, DisCos, MOJEC has spearheaded deployment of meters at its own risk across the country.

According to her, about 5 million per-paid electricity meters have so far installed under different government meter deployment initiatives, saying, her company is responsible for 50 per cent of the number so achieved.

She said, the group is ready to enhance present installed meter production capacity to meet demand level by the PMI, adding that, her firm is inching towards increasing local content component of its meter assembly from 40 per cent to over 60 per cent and fully attain 100 per cent as urged by the minister.

The minister had earlier noted the substantial metering gap in Nigeria, and that citizens are tired of estimated billing.

'Before the end of this year, we are looking at the possibility of ending estimated billing because we want transparency and objectivity in our billing system,' adding that, the Presidential metering initiative will harmonise all metering acquisitions in the country.

He stated that, ""We have up to eight million meters gap in Nigeria and what the initiative seeks to achieve is to close this gap within three to five years. This means that an average of two million meters is required on a yearly basis and achieving the target is compulsory for citizens to enjoy stable power supply,''

According to him, the Meter Assets Providers (MAPs) would equally have to provide a minimum number of 2,000 meters to participate in the market, stating that, Nigeria should be self-reliant, adding that, Nigeria has a market for its products.",leadership.ng,news,Leadership,Chika Izuora,0.1529411764705881,448963110,1,https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prepaid-meters.webp,eng-9420303

Climate policies have become the biggest point of contention between Labor and the Coalition, with the two sides warring over which achieves a combined outcome of emission reductions and provision of energy relief to financially burdened households.

Members of the opposition have dismissed the government's assertions of nuclear being an expensive and environmentally-detrimental means of power, along with being an industry that would take too long to get up and running in Australia.

The Coalition is questioning why the government cannot look to incorporate nuclear in the energy mix by building small modular reactors (SMR) like its other Western counterparts including Canada, UK, and the US.

Canada, which has embraced nuclear in both small and large-scale capacities and cemented its status as a world leader in research and technology of the electricity source, generates about 15 per cent of its total power through SMRs.

Discussing the nation's energy operations exclusively with Sky News Australia, Energy Minister for Ontario Todd Smith said Australia should model itself on Canada's thriving nuclear industry which was ""at the forefront of the Western world"".

""One of the things that we have been able to do is eliminate coal from our system and I know that's something that you're aiming to do in Australia as well,"" he told Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood in an exclusive interview.

""The biggest reason why we were able to eliminate coal was because we have that reliable, baseload, emissions-free nuclear fleet that we continue to build on, to ensure that we have a green system in Ontario. And it's one of the cleanest electricity grids in the entire world, at about 90 per cent emissions-free.""

In Ontario, which is Canada's most populated state, about 50 to 60 per cent of electricity generation comes from 19 operable Candu reactors - a model pioneered by Canada - including what is the world's largest operating nuclear facility at Bruce Power.

Mr Smith said nuclear had not just helped bring down the cost of electricity but also helped tackle the ""intermittent, unreliable"" issues of generating renewable power amid periods of unfavourable weather including lacking sunlight and slow winds.

""Wind and solar installations just aren't there when you need them,"" the Canadian energy minister said.

""This sounds elementary but the sun doesn't shine at night. So your solar disappears at night. The wind... quite often, only produces at night.

""Both of them have capacity factors, meaning they are there only about 25 to 35 per cent of the time, whereas the nuclear facilities that we have in Ontario are there 94 to 97 per cent of the time, 365 days a year, 24-seven. You can count on them and we have counted on them for the last 40 to 50 years in Ontario.""

Mr Smith was also questioned about declarations by Australia's Climate Council that developing nuclear power would take too long to make a significant difference to energy output and the positive climate change and decarbonisation result Australia is seeking.

In response, the energy minister said an SMR which has been under development in Ontario's Darlington since 2022 was expected to be completed and functioning by late 2028 or early 2029.

This time period is in stark contrast to figures floated by the Albanese government, who claim it would take a minimum of 19 years to build a nuclear power plant.

Meanwhile, the Coalition's timeline for nuclear power to be instated in Australia is 10 years.

Mr Smith said embracing nuclear also had far-reaching benefits for the economy and would complement a renewable energy market, as it was a lucrative industry for investments, including from automakers, EV battery manufacturers, and green steel-making producers.

""Our population is growing as fast as it is, is because we have reliable, affordable electricity that comes from our nuclear facilities, our hydro facilities... we're preparing for the future so we can continue to see these types of investments and growth,"" he said.

""(We realised) if we want to hit the climate targets that have been set by the federal government, that there's really only one way that you can do that, and that's with reliable, affordable baseload power that really only comes from small modular reactors or large reactors.""

Paleontologist Rodolfo Salas said the skull belonged to the largest dolphin known to have inhabited the waters of South America, measuring 3 to 3.5 meters long (9.8 to 11.4 feet). It was named Pebanista yacuruna after the Yacuruna, a Peruvian mythological being that lived in deep water.

""This dolphin is related to the dolphin of the Ganges river in India,"" Salas said, adding the one found in Peru is much bigger than its living relatives in Asia.

The ancestors of both dolphins formerly lived in the ocean, Salas said.

""This allowed them to occupy large ocean spaces near the coasts of India and South America. These animals lived in the freshwater environments both in the Amazon and India. Sadly, they became extinct in the Amazon, but in India they survived,"" Salas added.

The study was published in the journal Science Advances.

Scientists found the fossil during a 2018 expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society at the Napo River.

The Amazon and Orinoco river basins still are home to a species known as the Amazon river dolphin, also called the pink river dolphin or boto.

This weekend marks the tenth anniversary of their involvement with this special fixture in the football calendar.

Since 2014, Prostate Cancer UK has worked with the National League, its sponsors Vanarama, as well as hundreds of clubs. They have reached hundreds of thousands of men as well as raising more than £250,000, attracting national media attention in the process. And this year will be no different.

I was at Eastleigh to watch my team, Hartlepool United, in National League action.

Prostate Cancer is a disease that affects one in eight men in the UK. That's thousands of dads, grandads, partners, brothers, uncles, sons and mates. Those odds shorten to one in four if you are black.

It's so key to raise awareness and football has been a key driver for doing so. From many Premier League managers wearing the Man of Men badge on their lapel in post-match interviews that are beamed to a worldwide wide audience to special events like this.

When we've done the marathon walks around the country over the years, the ideas was always to visit as many football clubs - from Premier to Non-League - that we could. So many people come into contact with their local football club.

Take Pools for example. Where else, on a good day, do you get 5,000 people together on a Saturday afternoon where you get the message through? Of course, it's also about supporting your team. You those see in the Premier League - Newcastle and Liverpool - when they're affected by injuries.

Of course, it's an excuse when it doesn't go well and lots of teams could give the same story. But further down the ladder you feel the impact of those injuries even more.

Ours have been beyond belief to a absolutely key players. Anthony Mancini, Josh Umerah, Danny Dodds hasn't kicked a ball since he was injured against Fylde in August. Those three are massive players for us. It's hard to find replacements of that calibre.

You pray players like Mani Dieseruvwe and Nicky Featherstone stay fit. They've dragged us kicking and screaming up the table.

Obviously we changed manager, like many teams do, and Kev Phillips has been doing well.

We're much stronger defensively. The arrival of Luke Waterfall and Tom Parkes have really helped that. They may not be blessed with pace but they have that real nous.

Without Dieseruvwe's goals we would be right down there so we know we need to score more goals. But having a manager who knew where the back of the net was can only be good.

I'm told he is really handson. He wants to coach, not just be a figurehead at the front.

This is a guy who was the Premier League's Golden Boot winner in 1999-2000, when he scored 30 goals for Sunderland and an England international who has played at the highest level.

But he's willing to get stuck in - as he did at South Shields - so far down the pyramid. There is a lot to like about that. Of course I am biased, but I wish him well because of how he is doing it.

It's possibly a misguided perception that with Chesterfield out of the division next season, it feels a bit more open. Whoever comes down out of League Two, won't carry the same financial and support clout Chesterfield have got.

If you'd asked at the start of the season who will be up there, everyone would have chosen Chesterfield. And all credit to them.

However, if you look at the six who come next in the table, not many would have picked teams like Altrincham or FC Halifax to be in the mix at this stage of the season.

It's such a wide open division - and that's one of the attractions of it.",thenonleaguefootballpaper.com,news,The Non League Football Paper - Daily football news,,0.003921568627450966,448962720,1,http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jeff-and-james.jpg,

Their work has succeeded in reducing the exhaust particles from the combustion of fuel, which has led to increasing interest in the contribution of particulates from lubrication oil. When discussing oil-related particulate emissions, hydrocarbon particles are customarily referred to. This thesis uses a broader definition, in which oil-related particulate emissions are modelled not only by the hydrocarbons, but also include the ash, carbons, and sulphate oil particulate emissions. The model developed in the project uses input data as oil consumption and oil ash content combined with tuning parameters, such as the oil ash transfer rate (ash emissions divided by oil consumption and oil ash content). Controlled engine tests have been performed to verify assumptions and fill knowledge gaps. The model can be applied to a variety of diesel engines, although the tuning factors might have to be reset. For example, introducing diesel particulate filters would dramatically reduce the oil ash emissions, since oil ash would accumulate in the filter. Oil consumption has played a central role in the present research. The modelling results indicate that special attention should be paid to oil consumption under running conditions with a low in-cylinder temperature, since the oil survival rate is high there.

China will make greater efforts to diffuse debt risks of financing platforms, said Chinese premier Li Qiang in a meeting focusing on mitigating risks of local government debt on Friday.

China will resolutely block the path for irregular and disguised debts and strictly prevent the risk of newly-added debts, said Li.

The Commerce ministry said on Friday that foreign investment into China fell 19.9% in the first two months of 2024 from the amount in January-February last year to 215 billion yuan ($30 billion).

China on Tuesday unveiled new steps to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment, including expanding market access and relaxing some rules.

Overseas firms have turned sour on China since it enacted ultra-strict COVID curbs during the pandemic then suddenly abandoned them in late 2022, with concerns over the business environment, a shaky economic recovery and rising geopolitical tensions with the West weighing on confidence.

A series of prolonged regulatory crackdowns on sectors from technology to education have also rattled domestic and foreign investors, adding to unease over policy transparency in China.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last year that American businesses had told her that China was becoming ""uninvestible.""

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China shank 8% year-on-year.

Of the foreign investment in the first two months, 71.44 billion yuan, or a third of the total, went into China's high-tech industries, including high-tech manufacturing, the ministry said.

Foreign investment in China's construction sector rose 43.6% year-on-year, while investment in wholesale and retail industries grew 14.5%, it added.

In return, China's central government accelerated spending at the start of the year, a sign it's taking on more financing responsibility to support the economy and to avoid worsening local government debt risks, Bloomberg reported.

Its general public expenditure jumped 14% from a year earlier to 482.8 billion yuan ($66.8 billion) in January and February combined, the fastest pace for the period in five years, according to data provided by the Ministry of Finance.

Bloomberg said Beijing is gradually shifting the responsibility for supporting economic growth to central government from local officials -- a way to maintain the level of investment while defusing local debt risks.

Local governments have been struggling after a property crisis reduced a critical source of income from land sales, and a slowing economy weighed on tax revenues.

The latest data shows Beijing intends to ""underpin growth while preventing risks,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.

Central and local authorities spent almost 700 billion yuan in the first two months on agriculture, forest and irrigation-related issues, as well as urban and rural community development. This is up 22% from a year earlier.

In a separate development, China's securities regulator launched onsite inspections of some mutual fund companies as part of efforts to strengthen management of the industry, unnerving fund managers.

The securities watchdog, under newly appointed Chairman Wu Qing, vowed a week ago to set up a ""textbook-style"" supervision model to regulate China's $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry, according to Reuters.

The latest round of inspections, conducted without notice by branches of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), covered daily operations, training, and strengthening internal Chinese Communist Party functions, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday. It did not name the asset managers inspected.

In response to a Reuters query, CSRC said: ""It's regular on-site inspection that we conduct every year.""

The CSRC branches inspected fund companies based outside their regions, which the article said can prevent local interference.

Abdillahi Maalin Sufurow

Jowhar (HOL) - Hirshabelle regional state President, Ali Gudlawe Hussein, fired the governor of Hiiraan region, Abdillahi Maalin Sufurow, on Saturday, who had held the position since June of last year, 2023.

Muse Salaad Weheliye has been appointed as the region's new governor despite the Hirshabelle State not providing a reason for Sufurow's dismissal.

Sufurow did not officially resume office after his predecessor, Ali Jeyte Osman, refused to give him the position.

Two weeks ago, local forces loyal to the recently formed Hiiraan State administration ousted governor Abdillahi Maalin Sufurow and his security guards from Beledweyne after a clash in the town that killed six people.

Governor Sufurow has been working in the El-Jale area since the clash after Hirshabelle Interior Minister Abdirahman Dahir Gure confirmed that they relocated the governor and his guards to El-Jale to prevent further clashes. Hirshabelle administration and Hiiraan State officials trade blame for the deadly clash that erupted in Beledweyne.

However, it's unclear how the new governor will be able to work in Beledweyne, as the Hiiraan State administration, which is against the Hirshabelle administration, controls the town.",hiiraan.com,news,Hiiraan Online,,-0.2,448962609,1,http://www.hiiraan.com/2024/images/Mar/2024324638468487978123832.jpg,

The drones were downed over parts of central, southern and southeastern Ukraine, the country's military said.

Energy workers are still working to restore electricity to some Ukrainians, though, a day after Moscow launched what Kyiv said was the largest attack of the war on the country's power grid, authorities said Saturday.

The ""technical possibility for electricity supply"" had been restored in most affected regions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. But the situation remained difficult in the region of Kharkiv, which was hit particularly hard.

People in Kharkiv city, as well as the western Khmelnytskyi region, were still without power, national grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement.

The Russian assault killed at least five people and left more than 1 million people without power. It also struck Ukraine's largest dam.

On Saturday morning, meanwhile, two people were killed and seven were injured in Ukrainian air attacks on Russia's Belgorod region, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said in a post on Telegram.

An overnight drone attack by Ukraine on Russia's Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery.

In turn, Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday its forces had taken control of the village of Krasnoye in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.

Many Ukrainians were plunged into darkness across several cities, at least five people were killed, and damage to the country's largest hydroelectric plant briefly cut off power to a nuclear plant that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

Russia fired off more than 60 exploding drones and 90 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as the most brutal attack against its energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began in early 2022.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, sustained the most damage, officials said, and the attack came a day after Russia had fired 31 missiles into the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Western allies for weeks to provide it with additional air-defense systems and ammunition, a period in which $60 billion in U.S. aid has been held up by divisions in Congress.

Smoke and fire are seen around high-voltage lines at a site of a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, outside Kharkiv, Ukraine, March 22, 2024.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state,' Zelenskyy said. ""It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions.""

Russia's defense ministry called the Friday attacks ""strikes of retribution."" Ukraine has increased shelling of Russia's Belgorod region along its northeast border and has launched drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries and other energy facilities.

Ukraine's latest strike inside Russia on Friday killed one person and injured at least three, according to local officials.

Putin has described Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod and other regions as an effort to frighten residents and derail the highly orchestrated election that ended Sunday. And he vowed to strike back.

The day after he declared victory, Putin said Russia would seek to create a buffer zone inside eastern Ukraine to help protect against long-range strikes and cross-border raids.

Russia has made progress on the battlefield in recent months against exhausted Ukrainian troops struggling with a shortage of manpower and ammunition along the front line that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).

When Putin invaded in 2022, he called it a ""special military operation,"" and his officials have mostly eschewed the word ""war."" But in a change of rhetoric Friday that may herald a new escalation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian newspaper that ""when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.""

In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts across the country. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat the strategy this winter, but Russia instead focused its strikes on Ukraine's defense industries.

While launching the strikes, Russia has combined sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles with waves of cheap Iranian-made Shahed drones in a bid to oversaturate and weaken Ukrainian air defenses.

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, head of the national utility Ukrenergo, described Friday's barrage as the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he said.

Kudrytskyi said that Russia 'tried to destroy every significant energy object powering the city of Kharkiv,"" leaving at least 700,000 without electricity. He estimated that several hundred thousand customers in other regions were also left without power.

In this photo provided by Telegram Channel of Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, smoke and fire rise over the Dnipro hydroelectric power plant after Russian attacks in Dnipro, Ukraine, March 22, 2024.

Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, said that 31 people were injured in the strikes, which also left 200,000 people without constant access to electricity in the Odesa region. He said that power supplies for most of 400,000 customers in the Dnipropetrovsk region were restored.

The huge Dnipro hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine's largest, halted operation after sustaining at least six missile hits that caused massive damage. Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhidroenergo company overseeing the country's hydroelectric plants, said it lost about a third of its generation capacity in a ""significant loss for the Ukrainian energy system.""

Syrota said that the extent of damage to the plant remained unclear because its equipment has been buried under concrete and metal debris from the blasts, noting that the repairs will be a ""long process.""

The strikes sparked a fire at the Dnipro plant, which supplies electricity to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. Power to the nuclear plant was lost for several hours before it was restored, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian troops since early days of the invasion, and fighting around it has raised the risk of a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding like what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper River collapsed.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.6941176470588235,448962479,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711197367.jpg,

MOSCOW, March 24. /TASS/. Gazprom supplies gas for Europe through Ukraine in the volume of 42.1 mln cubic meters per day via the Sudzha gas pumping station, a Gazprom representative told reporters, adding that the request for pumping through Sokhranovka had been rejected by the Ukrainian side.

""Gazprom supplies Russian gas for transit through Ukrainian territory in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side via the Sudzha gas pumping station of 42.1 mln cubic meters as of March 24. The request for the Sokhranovka gas pumping station has been rejected,"" he said. Earlier the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) confirmed the request for pumping of this volume of gas.

On Saturday, March 23, the pumping equaled 42.4 mln cubic meters.

The transit line through Ukraine remains the only route to supply Russian gas to western and central European countries. The pumping through Nord Stream has been fully suspended.

In May 2022, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of gas to Europe via the Sokhranovka transit point due to force majeure as the company allegedly was unable to control the Novopskov gas compressor station in the Lugansk People's Republic. However, the Russian gas giant did not see any proof of force majeure.

In the fall of 2022, Ukraine's Naftogaz company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Arbitration Court against Gazprom for allegedly being late with its payment for gas transportation services through Ukraine. Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller stated that the Russian company considered Naftogaz's arbitration to be illegitimate.

The wind power project, located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from capital Dhaka, is invested by Wuling Power Corp., a subsidiary of China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC), and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp..

Upon full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households.

Md. Abdul Kader Goni, the executive engineer of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told Xinhua that Bangladesh entered the era of first commercial wind power with the establishment of the wind power plant at Cox's Bazar.

Hei Zhao, general manager of Bangladesh division of Wuling Power Corp., said this is the first time that Chinese enterprises have introduced wind power into Bangladesh as investors, filling the gap in the wind power field in Bangladesh.

""During the construction of the project, we used Chinese solutions, Chinese standards and Chinese equipment to promote the sustainable development of Bangladesh's renewable energy industry, while training the first batch of practical talents in the field of wind power for Bangladesh and providing more than 1,500 local jobs,"" he added.

Manik Ahamed, the Bangladeshi engineer of the project, said that Bangladesh needs this kind of energy. ""I have learned a lot from this project, such as how to produce more energy with wind and how to safely produce electricity in the grid of Bangladesh. It's hoped that I can do more for our power and energy development.""

The average reference for the entire day in the wholesale market will be 6.69 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), according to the operator OMIE. Again, hour by hour there will be big differences.

The wholesale market figures are reflected in the consumer's receipt. The most expensive hour will be reached between 03:00 and 04:00, when the price on the invoice will rise to 0.06487 euros per kilowatt hour (kWh), based on data from Red Eléctrica. The cheapest hour, on the opposite side, will be recorded between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., when the kilowatt hour will be paid at 0.04576 euros.

These figures already include the cost of the daily and intraday wholesale market, adjustment services, financing, the cost of variable marketing, tolls and charges. It may also have other concepts such as payments for capacity, surpluses or deficits from renewable auctions and costs for interruptibility services.

The regulated bill prices are dynamic, indexed to the wholesale electricity market. As the energy demand per hour is the factor that determines the price of electricity in each time slot, the cost of electricity per hour varies constantly. Thus, with greater demand in peaks of cold - for heating - or heat - for air conditioners, for example -, prices rise.

''Action for water is action for peace. And today it is needed more than ever.''

''Our world is in turbulent waters. Conflicts are raging, inequality is rife, pollution and biodiversity loss are rampant, and, as humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, the climate crisis is accelerating with a deadly force - further threatening peace, Guterres remarked.

We must accelerate efforts to work together across borders, and I urge all countries to join and implement the United Nations Water Convention - which promotes managing shared water resources sustainably,'' he added.

Let's commit to work together, to make water a force for cooperation, harmony and stability, and so help to create a world of peace and prosperity for all, he concluded.

World Water Day, held on 22 March every year since 1993, is an annual United Nations Observance focusing on the importance of freshwater.

World Water Day celebrates water and raises awareness of the 2.2 billion people living without access to safe water. It is about taking action to tackle the global water crisis. A core focus of World Water Day is to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6: water and sanitation for all by 2030. (ANI/WAM)

But what if that something is as vast and unfathomable as solar energy, how do we do it? Under the maxim that knowledge is power, Factorenergia and Blockchain Digital Energy have joined forces to digitize energy through blockchain with one objective: to increase the efficiency and savings of solar communities.

Photovoltaic self-consumption is changing the role of the consumer within the energy production chain. Going from the end, with total dependence on large infrastructures combined with an extensive energy transportation network, to the origin of that same chain. In the era of renewables, photovoltaic energy is the only one that deploys its full potential without even having to leave home.

The energy that can be generated on our roofs under the sun is clean, cheap and kilometer zero. Rapidly deployed, it is capable of covering the needs of our homes immediately and exporting excess energy to the grid. That is, with self-consumption we stop being passive consumers and become active producers (prosumer). It is energy sovereignty that, with the help of Factorenergia, is reaching more neighboring communities.

By opting for a collective deployment, more affordable for the citizen than if it were implemented individually, it is estimated that self-consumption in neighboring communities could give access to energy sovereignty to 70% of the population. A giant step in the decarbonization objectives demanded by the 2030 Agenda and that the planet is crying out for. This is already a reality in a community within the residential development of La Mallola, in Esplugues de Llobregat (Barcelona).

Composed of 14 collective self-consumption facilities and a total peak power of 511.11 kWp, Factorenergia serves 159 participating neighbors who, thanks to blockchain technology, monitor and record the data generated in individualized readings for each neighbor and in real time. Information that, in a rigorous, safe and easy-to-interpret manner, provides them with greater knowledge of their consumption. It is the first time that energy has been digitized using blockchain technology, but the effects are already tangible. ""Those who have and are aware of the energy values associated with their installation or participation in real time, maximize the savings on their electricity bill,"" says Emili Rousaud, CEO of Factorenergia.

As a kind of digital notary of your consumption, all energy exports made by each user are registered, valued and secured thanks to Blockchain

Digital Energy, the company that developed the device. This knowledge allows them to modulate their energy behavior, know the surplus generated, share it with other nearby supply points or family members, or sell it to other users.

Joaquín Nora, a resident of La Mallola, lives alone with his wife, has very low expenses and redirects the excess energy generated to an apartment in Cubelles. In his case, he wanted to be part of the energy community for several reasons. ""The first, for the sense of community, for everyone being in the project. Second, for the ecological issue, which is very important to me. Third, obviously, due to the improvement in the electricity bill.""

The reasons do not end there, since the imminent purchase of an electric car and the foreseeable increase in its electricity consumption when plugging it in will be neutralized by the community's solar installation. A final unexpected factor, but much celebrated by the community, is the drop in the temperature of the attic by about five degrees. ""That has been very positive,"" highlights Nora.

Accustomed to consulting consumption records practically blindly on invoices that are barely or not at all understandable, the user can maximize their performance, objectively decide if they want to sell the surplus to the marketer, or move energy uses to other time slots, among other options. With this device, the information is updated every hour and is available through the mobile app. ""They have greater governance and trust in their data to decide when and how they consume the energy that is generated,"" adds Henry Daunert, CEO of Blockchain Digital Energy.

María Lorena Álvarez is another of the residents of La Mallola who, thanks to the application, can see first-hand how the energy generated on her roof impacts savings on her bill. ""I will be able to understand what my savings are and organize my consumption during the hours when energy is cheaper or has zero cost."" Together with the community of residents of La Mallola, this technological solution is already a reality in the Institut Torrent dels Alous and the Rubí Courts, which share the energy generated in the panels installed on the roof of the institute. The only requirement is that the participants in the installation be within a two-kilometer radius.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,Oliver Thansan,0.411764705882353,448962228,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_987e5.png,

Despite having more money at their disposal after the removal of fuel subsidy, there are mixed feelings over alleged failure of some states to deploy the increased revenue into tackling hardship in their states through life-changing projects, Daily Trust on Sunday reports.

Amidst the cost-of-living crisis, the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) is making more money available to states from the proceeds of the removal of subsidy.

Analysis of the allocation before and after subsidy for three months showed that incomes accruing to states have increased significantly, almost doubling what was accruable to them in the three months before the subsidy removal.

While some states have carried out tangible palliatives and interventions; in many others, it has been lamentation upon lamentation as residents said they were yet to feel the impacts of the increased allocations to the states.

Daily Trust on Sunday investigations showed that from February, March and April 2023, the 36 states got N776 billion as FAAC allocation.

Fast forward to October, November and December, 2023 after the subsidy had been removed, they got N1 trillion, an increase of over N200 billion.

Delta State got the highest allocation from February, March and April 2023 amounting to N104 billion; followed by Akwa Ibom, N74 billion and Rivers, N71 billion.

Bayelsa got N53 billion during the months under review pre-subsidy; Lagos, N34 billion; Kano, N23 billion; Edo and Ondo, N21 billion each; Jigawa had a three-month allocation of N19 billion; Oyo, N18 billion; Anambra, N17 billion; Borno and Benue N17 billion each.

Others were Katsina, N16 billion; Kaduna and Kebbi, N15 billion each; Adamawa, Imo, Enugu and Bauchi, N14 billion each; Niger, Sokoto, Nasarawa, Taraba, Kogi and Yobe, N13 billion each; Cross River, Zamfara, Ebonyi and Kwara, N12 billion each; Plateau, Gombe, Osun and Ekiti, N11 billion each.

States that had the lowest allocation in the months under review were Abia and Ogun which got N9 billion each.

Fast forward to the last quarter of 2023 (October, November and December) after the subsidy removal, with millions of citizens already feeling the pangs of the high cost of fuel, transportation, food items; and with inflation inching towards 29 per cent and the dollar exchanging for over N1,400, it was a new dawn for the states.

For instance, Abia, which got the lowest allocation in February, March and April 2023, received N22 billion (N13 billion extra) for the last quarter of 2023; while Ogun was also allocated N17 billion (N8 billion extra); Plateau, N18 billion (N7 billion extra); Gombe, N18 billion (N7 billion extra); Osun, N19 billion (N8 billion extra); Ekiti, N18 billion (N7 billion extra); Cross River, N18 billion (N7 billion extra) and Kwara, N18 billion (N6 billion extra).

Lagos State government has so far subsidised food items in some local markets which are open to members of the public on weekends. The government has also reduced transportation cost by 25 per cent on all state-run transport channels.

Also, a new work schedule for the workforce in the state's civil service was announced with workers on Grade Levels 1 to 14 permitted to work three times weekly until further notice.

However, civil servants on Grade Levels 15 to 17 will work four days in a week.

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the state government will be distributing combo packages of food items to vulnerable Lagosians, targeting 300,000 households.

The governor said the state had concluded the procurement of over 100 trailers of rice and other food items, but is currently fine-tuning the logistics for seamless distribution to the beneficiaries.

Osun

In Osun State, Governor Ademola Adeleke paid a wage award of N15,000 to each of the active workers in the state; and N10,000 to each of the pensioners in the state for three months.

Governor Adeleke equally enrolled some pensioners and vulnerable people in the state for health insurance.

Akwa Ibom

In Akwa Ibom, the state government said it had only received N2 billion fuel subsidy funds from the federal government in form of a loan alongside 3,000 bags of rice, but was silent on the FAAC allocation over which citizens are asking critical questions about utilisation.

Governor Umo Eno said that the state government purchased additional bags of rice for the people, which raised its contributions to the palliatives scheme to over N5 billion.

One of the beneficiaries of the palliative fund, a civil servant, Mr. Saviour Willie, said the sum of N10,000 was paid into his account last year after he filled and submitted a form.

Willie noted that though some other civil servants collected the money for three months, he was only paid once.

Kebbi

In Kebbi, some of the residents, who spoke to our correspondent, said they were not happy with the way the palliatives were distributed in the state. Some of them alleged that those in charge favoured the All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters.

A resident of Birnin Kebbi, Aliyu Abbas, said the government should take control and monitor how the palliatives were being distributed.

""Those appointed in the previous distribution disappointed a lot of people in the state.

""Now that the government is planning another palliative for Ramadan, it should be different. They should consider everybody because the government belongs to all of us"", he said.

The state government said it had spent N5.7 billion to procure 210 truckloads of 126,000 bags of assorted grains for 720,000 families across the 21 local government areas of the state.

It also flagged off disbursement of N3 billion to 15,000 people to invest in businesses, and it gave N20 million to widows of fallen soldiers, procured N3 billion worth of fertilisers to farmers, among other interventions.

Despite this, many were not impressed, saying many vulnerable people like widows, divorcees, and orphans did not benefit.

Kwara

Following the removal of subsidy, the Kwara State government rolled out what it called ""Multi-Sectoral"" palliatives that cut across different sectors in the state, including students and vulnerable groups.

The government also said it supported artisans with N265 million worth of palliatives, among several others, and distributed over N4 billion worth of rice and maize packed in 10kg and N50kg bags to residents.

According to the Commissioner for Communication, Mrs. Bola Olukoju, over N5.7 billion had been spent to support 124,170 households since the subsidy removal.

Speaking on the issue, a civil servant, who did not want his name in print because of fear of victimisation, said: ""Compared to the money that accrued to state, we only got N10,000 palliatives from the government.""

Another civil servant wondered whether such intervention would, in any way, change the life of a family.

""It has added no value to our standard of living and has not really impacted the family. It's not even enough to take us home when you look at the astronomical increase in transport fares,"" he said.

Ogun

In Ogun State, residents expressed mixed reactions over the palliative measures rolled out by the state government.

The measures by the government include the inauguration of 17 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) mass transit buses in Abeokuta and the announcement of an extension of N10,000 transport allowances for all workers and pensioners by six months.

The state government had, on September 1, 2023, flagged off the distribution of 300,000 10kg bags of rice to residents of the state.

However, the distribution of the palliatives has been marred by controversy and criticism as residents accused the government of poor distribution of the food item.

Kogi

Several citizens in Kogi lamented that they were wallowing in hardships, with many homes in ruins since the removal of the fuel subsidy.

The government distributed food palliatives. including rice, beans and vegetable oil in the last week of October 2023, repeating it in February 2024 under the new leadership of Usman Ahmed Ododo.

The food palliatives were distributed to the citizens in the 21 local governments, including professional organisations and security agencies.

Daily Trust on Sunday reports that the state government is yet to implement the N30, 000 minimum wage for workers up till this time, despite the enormous resources accruing to the state.

The state chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Barnabas Simon, during a protest recently, said the removal of the fuel subsidy was the death knell that brought about the prevailing economic woes.

The Bayelsa State government, however, said that the revenue saved from the federal government's fuel subsidy removal policy had not been reflected in its monthly allocation.

It, nonetheless, confirmed receipt of N2 billion as fuel subsidy removal palliative fund from the federal government.

Niger

Niger State had witnessed a series of protests by residents due to persistent hunger and hardship even when the government claimed to have shared billions of naira palliatives.

On September 1, 2023, Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago announced the distribution of N3.6 billion palliatives to citizens across the state.

Residents said despite the warning by the governor against diversion, items meant for the poor and vulnerable people were diverted by politicians and members of the distribution committees across the state.

Residents of Minna and other towns told our correspondent that they were yet to feel the impact of the palliatives' distribution by the state, even as the state government said it has spent over N3 billion on residents in September 2023.

The government also announced plans to purchase 200 CNG buses at N7 billion in September 2023.

Cross River

Upon the removal of subsidy, the administration of Governor Bassey Otu said it had distributed bags of grains, including rice and beans to 18 LGAs of the state as palliatives.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, James Anam, said that some of the bags of rice were given to Cameroonian refugees in Ogoja and other camps.

But ordinary citizens in Calabar said that many of them got three cups of rice each.

Edet Eteng, a shop owner, said, ""I have a wife and three children and I was given only three cups of rice.

""In our street of more than 1,000 people, only two bags got to us. So how long can this sustain the family?"" he asked.

Benue

In Benue, the state government said it distributed bags of rice and maize as palliatives from the federal government to people of the state in December last year through the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), but many residents complained that they did not benefit from the palliatives.

The food items reportedly distributed included 21 trucks of maize and 35 trucks of rice.

A resident, Terlumum Dikor, said the hardship inflicted on the masses following the subsidy removal was excruciating and even more painful that there were no palliatives in sight to cushion the attendant suffering.

Edo

In Edo, after the initial announcement of intervention from the federal government, there was the provision of free buses in some routes.

A second palliative programme said to have guzzled N1 billion tagged 'feed the hungry initiative' was launched by the state government, aimed at feeding over 60,000.

The state government said it had commenced many other programmes to cushion the hardship on the people since June last year.

Some of the residents, who spoke on the development, said they had not seen any palliative from the state government, aside the free bus ride since June 2023, when the fuel subsidy was removed.

Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, dismissed this claim, saying the government had been proactive in cushioning the hardship on people since cost of living crisis started in the country.

No meaningful developments in states - Experts

Many experts have said that with the exception of a few, the increased allocation from the federation account has not translated into meaningful developments in states.

They called for greater checks on what is happening at the state level.

Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr Muda Yusuf, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said there was the need for improved accountability at the state and local government levels, saying very few states were doing something meaningful.

He said, ""Well, I am not sure we are seeing the impact, but what I do know is that for some states, there are a few indications that they are doing something.

""There are intervention programmes and all of that, at least one good example that people always cite is Borno state governor and other states, actually I don't have the list.

""From what I can see generally, the impact is not in the increase in revenue, the states need to do more to justify the revenue that they are collecting.

""You know, some states, particularly in the South-South, will take a lot from derivation and other things like that, but when you look at it, there is no much to show,"" he said.

The Global Director of the Brain Builders Youth Development Initiative, BBYDI, Abideen Olasupo, said there should be greater focus on states.

""That is the reason why conversation should start going towards the state governments, enough of concentrating all our woes on the federal government; that is why local government autonomy should be deepened.

""State policing is only what our state governments are talking about. So, the issue of transparency and accountability by individuals should shift from the federal to the states because, year-in year- out, allocations are increasing, citizens are not seeing what is commensurate in terms of increasing allocation,"" he said.

Reacting to the development, Chairman, Arewa Economic Forum (AEF), Ibrahim Shehu Dandakata, alleged that the huge sums of money available to state governors were not trickling down because the governors were not investing in areas that would reflate the state economies, and appear not committed to providing palliatives for the people.

""The check we conducted on recent FAAC allocations showed that some of the states have had their allocations increased by up to 90 per cent, with little or no improvement in the lives of the people. The percentage increase in the allocations to states after fuel subsidy removal is humongous,"" he said.",dailytrust.com,news,Daily Trust,,-0.09019607843137256,448962157,1,https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/citizens-demand-life-changing-projects-as-states-get-more-funds-749x400.jpg,

VIJAYAWADA: Citizens For Democracy (CFD) organised a round table meeting here on Saturday on 'Free and Fair Elections - Challenges and Corrupt Practices', where the speakers expressed concern over the brazen deployment of money power in particular, making a mockery of the expenditure limits set by the Election Commission of India.

The ability to spend has become a key determinant in the selection of candidates, and posed a threat to democratic polity, they said and observed that the failure of the ECI to rein in political parties and candidates as was effectively done in the Seshan era, was clearly visible.

The members expressed grave concern over volunteers openly donning political colours and unashamedly canvassing for the ruling party unchecked, which has emerged as the most serious threat to free and fair elections in the State.

In this piece of great investigative journalism, we learned from interviewed experts that proposed technologies for characterizing the seafloor in support of understanding the feasibility of turbine anchoring/infrastructure have been/are employed by a multitude of organizations, with negligible impact to sea life. Onboard marine biologists will temporarily stop the survey if endangered species are observed. Biological surveys are planned for environmental impact studies along with identifying potential mitigating actions.

Yet the Morro Bay Group REACT is against the ocean surveys and plans to protest offshore wind at every step. REACT's leader indicated that they would consider taking money from the fossil fuel industry if it came down to a lawsuit. Really? REACT is open to taking money from an industry that has spread disinformation about climate change for decades and now admits to plans for unfettered oil and gas production going forward? That is extreme.

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for the excellent ""reality check"" article on the environmental impact of surveys conducted for proposed offshore wind (OSW) projects. Having worked for the city of Morro Bay, I know many of the folks in the REACT group and worked side-by-side with some of them to make Morro Bay the beautiful place that it is today. It saddens me to see them taking positions against OSW based on inaccurate information and, in turn, spreading that misinformation in the community.

I, too, have concerns about OSW and its impact on the local environment, but I try not to forget the bigger picture. Whales and other marine creatures are facing a present and growing threat from climate change fueled by the burning of fossil fuels. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt feeding grounds, alter migration patterns and harm vital ecosystems. As krill populations shift due to warming, whales struggle to find food, impacting their health and reproduction.

The transition to clean energy such as OSW is needed now and can be done responsibly. The future of the whales and the health of our planet depends on it!

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for your vital new ""reality check"" series and for including offshore wind development as the first topic of interest. We know that the climate crisis is largely caused by fossil fuels. As we work to preserve a livable world for future generations, we need to be well informed on the facts about sustainable energy sources, including one of the cleanest: wind energy. For constructive public discourse and sound decision-making to take place, we should inform ourselves with facts from trustworthy sources and data-driven research.

Your well researched articles clarify that the ocean surveys off the San Luis Obispo County coastline will be following safe, established practices. When it comes to our oceans, we should remember that it is climate change caused by using fossil fuels that is threatening marine life.

It is good news that many nations are adopting offshore wind as a major tool to transition to carbon free electricity. Just this month, America's first commercial scale offshore wind farm began delivering clean power to New York's electric grid. Later this year, another offshore wind farm will begin powering homes and businesses in Massachusetts. We need to be equally forward-looking in California.

""SLO readers opposed battery storage plant in Morro Bay,"" (sanluisobispo.com, Sept. 22, 2023)

Under Assembly Bill 205, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022, energy bills would take into account customers' incomes. People protested to the California Public Utilities Commission, asking them to either reject the proposal (partly because it would not reward customers who work hard to reduce energy usage) or provide guidance to the Legislature to change the law in a way that does not harm the middle class.

Reality Check: Is this law going to be implemented? Are rates going to be based on customers' incomes? Is that section taking effect? If so, when?

Another section of AB 205 applies to the permitting process of green energy projects, providing an expedited pathway for approval of projects that address climate change. The California Energy Commission could conceivably intervene and fast-track such a project.

Has this process been utilized by the CEC? How will this affect local control (such as in the case of the Morro Bay battery storage plant)?

""The Hur interview transcript offers a window into the life of 'frustrated architect' Joe Biden,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 15)

Special Counsel Robert Hur is probably not qualified to assess cognitive function, and his report contains statements about President Joe Biden's mental state that are gratuitous and political.

That said, Hur is an experienced prosecutor who is qualified to assess how a prosecution would go in front of a jury -- which is what he did. He followed the facts and the law and concluded that Biden should not be prosecuted, noting the huge differences between this case and the classified documents case against Donald Trump.

While we may feel that statements in Hur's report about Biden's memory were political, we should celebrate the fact that the Biden White House allowed a Trump appointee to do his job without political interference -- a process which would not have happened under the prior administration.

This should also put to rest Republican claims that the Department of Justice has somehow been ""weaponized"" against Trump and his cronies. In fact, Biden has bent over backwards to keep prosecutorial decisions at the DOJ from being politicized. As a country, we should be very proud of that.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.06666666666666665,448960941,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/san_luis_obispo_tribune_mcclatchy_articles_722/c764dcf57c330313b3b61c4248baa32a,

The wind power project, located in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district, some 400 km away from capital Dhaka, is invested by Wuling Power Corp., a subsidiary of China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC), and built by PowerChina Chengdu Engineering Corp..

Upon full operation, the project will provide Bangladesh with about 145 million kWh of clean electricity per year, reduce coal consumption by 44,600 tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 109,200 tons, as well as meet the electricity demand of 100,000 households.

Md. Abdul Kader Goni, the executive engineer of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told Xinhua that Bangladesh entered the era of first commercial wind power with the establishment of the wind power plant at Cox's Bazar.

Hei Zhao, general manager of Bangladesh division of Wuling Power Corp., said this is the first time that Chinese enterprises have introduced wind power into Bangladesh as investors, filling the gap in the wind power field in Bangladesh.

""During the construction of the project, we used Chinese solutions, Chinese standards and Chinese equipment to promote the sustainable development of Bangladesh's renewable energy industry, while training the first batch of practical talents in the field of wind power for Bangladesh and providing more than 1,500 local jobs,"" he added.

Manik Ahamed, the Bangladeshi engineer of the project, said that Bangladesh needs this kind of energy. ""I have learned a lot from this project, such as how to produce more energy with wind and how to safely produce electricity in the grid of Bangladesh. It's hoped that I can do more for our power and energy development.""

""Now, the cooperation of the two countries in the energy field under the Belt and Road Initiative has achieved fruitful outcomes such as this first-ever wind power project in Cox's Bazar. In the future, we hope that we can have more and more highly qualified cooperation like this to contribute to our energy field development,"" Goni stressed. ■",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.07450980392156858,448960642,12,,

Abdulazeez Abdullahi, the Head of Corporate Communication at Kaduna Electric, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday.

Recall that reports alleged that electricity consumers in Kebbi State, one of the franchises of Kaduna Electric, will not pay electricity bills for the period of Ramadan on the basis that the state government had cleared the bill.

However, the Disco said the Governor, Nasir Idris, only partially subsidized the differential, which arose from improved power from 6 hours to an average of 12 hours.

""It is pertinent to note that the improvement in electricity supply was supposed to lead to a tariff increase for the customers in Birnin Kebbi by the hours enjoyed.

""However, in his kindness, the Governor agreed to partly pay for the differential as a subsidy and support for Ramadan.

""Based on the stated facts, we wish to debunk the insinuations making rounds that the Kebbi state government has paid Kaduna Electric for electricity supply in favour of individual customers during the holy month of Ramadan, and, therefore, customers are not expected to pay for the electricity consumed during the period.

This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market.

The Philippine military said the nearly hour-long attack occurred off Second Thomas Shoal in the contested South China Sea, where Chinese ships have unleashed water cannon and collided with Filipino vessels in similar stand-offs in recent months.

The military released video clips that showed a white ship repeatedly dousing another vessel sailing alongside it with a water cannon.

One clip showed two white ships simultaneously firing water at the same vessel.

It said the videos were taken Saturday morning while the Unaizah May 4 was on its way to Ayungin Shoal -- the Filipino name for the outcrop garrisoned by a small unit of Philippine troops that is also claimed by Beijing.

""The UM4 supply boat sustained heavy damages at around 08:52 (am) due to the continued blasting of water cannons from the CCG vessels,"" the military said in a statement, without describing the nature of the damage or whether there were any casualties.

Despite the attack, the damaged vessel and a coast guard escort ship that came to its aid later delivered its cargo as well as six navy personnel to the Filipino outpost, the military said in an update.

The military also released another video clip which it said was taken after the water cannon attack and showed a Chinese vessel deploying ""floating barriers to prevent further entry of any vessels in the shoal"".

The Philippine soldiers stationed on the shoal live on a derelict navy ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, and require frequent re-supplies for food, water and other necessities as well as transport for personnel rotations.

China Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu said in a statement that the Philippine convoy ""forcibly intruded into the area despite the Chinese side's repeated warnings and route controls"", adding the Chinese carried out ""control, obstruction and eviction in accordance with law"".

""We sternly warn the Philippine side: those who play with fire will bring shame on themselves.

""The Chinese Coast Guard is ready at all times to resolutely safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,"" Gan added.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims from other countries including the Philippines and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.

The latest confrontation came four days after visiting Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States stood by its ""ironclad"" commitments to defend longtime ally Manila against armed attack in the South China Sea.

Two days after Blinken's visit to Manila, the China Coast Guard also tried to drive away Filipino scientists who landed on two cays near Scarborough Shoal, another contested South China Sea outcrop.

The Unaizah May 4 was joined Saturday by an escort of two Filipino coast guard vessels and two Philippine Navy ships, a Philippine military statement said.

In this piece of great investigative journalism, we learned from interviewed experts that proposed technologies for characterizing the seafloor in support of understanding the feasibility of turbine anchoring/infrastructure have been/are employed by a multitude of organizations, with negligible impact to sea life. Onboard marine biologists will temporarily stop the survey if endangered species are observed. Biological surveys are planned for environmental impact studies along with identifying potential mitigating actions.

Yet the Morro Bay Group REACT is against the ocean surveys and plans to protest offshore wind at every step. REACT's leader indicated that they would consider taking money from the fossil fuel industry if it came down to a lawsuit. Really? REACT is open to taking money from an industry that has spread disinformation about climate change for decades and now admits to plans for unfettered oil and gas production going forward? That is extreme.

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for the excellent ""reality check"" article on the environmental impact of surveys conducted for proposed offshore wind (OSW) projects. Having worked for the city of Morro Bay, I know many of the folks in the REACT group and worked side-by-side with some of them to make Morro Bay the beautiful place that it is today. It saddens me to see them taking positions against OSW based on inaccurate information and, in turn, spreading that misinformation in the community.

I, too, have concerns about OSW and its impact on the local environment, but I try not to forget the bigger picture. Whales and other marine creatures are facing a present and growing threat from climate change fueled by the burning of fossil fuels. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt feeding grounds, alter migration patterns and harm vital ecosystems. As krill populations shift due to warming, whales struggle to find food, impacting their health and reproduction.

The transition to clean energy such as OSW is needed now and can be done responsibly. The future of the whales and the health of our planet depends on it!

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for your vital new ""reality check"" series and for including offshore wind development as the first topic of interest. We know that the climate crisis is largely caused by fossil fuels. As we work to preserve a livable world for future generations, we need to be well informed on the facts about sustainable energy sources, including one of the cleanest: wind energy. For constructive public discourse and sound decision-making to take place, we should inform ourselves with facts from trustworthy sources and data-driven research.

Your well researched articles clarify that the ocean surveys off the San Luis Obispo County coastline will be following safe, established practices. When it comes to our oceans, we should remember that it is climate change caused by using fossil fuels that is threatening marine life.

It is good news that many nations are adopting offshore wind as a major tool to transition to carbon free electricity. Just this month, America's first commercial scale offshore wind farm began delivering clean power to New York's electric grid. Later this year, another offshore wind farm will begin powering homes and businesses in Massachusetts. We need to be equally forward-looking in California.

""SLO readers opposed battery storage plant in Morro Bay,"" (sanluisobispo.com, Sept. 22, 2023)

Under Assembly Bill 205, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022, energy bills would take into account customers' incomes. People protested to the California Public Utilities Commission, asking them to either reject the proposal (partly because it would not reward customers who work hard to reduce energy usage) or provide guidance to the Legislature to change the law in a way that does not harm the middle class.

Reality Check: Is this law going to be implemented? Are rates going to be based on customers' incomes? Is that section taking effect? If so, when?

Another section of AB 205 applies to the permitting process of green energy projects, providing an expedited pathway for approval of projects that address climate change. The California Energy Commission could conceivably intervene and fast-track such a project.

Has this process been utilized by the CEC? How will this affect local control (such as in the case of the Morro Bay battery storage plant)?

""The Hur interview transcript offers a window into the life of 'frustrated architect' Joe Biden,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 15)

Special Counsel Robert Hur is probably not qualified to assess cognitive function, and his report contains statements about President Joe Biden's mental state that are gratuitous and political.

That said, Hur is an experienced prosecutor who is qualified to assess how a prosecution would go in front of a jury -- which is what he did. He followed the facts and the law and concluded that Biden should not be prosecuted, noting the huge differences between this case and the classified documents case against Donald Trump.

While we may feel that statements in Hur's report about Biden's memory were political, we should celebrate the fact that the Biden White House allowed a Trump appointee to do his job without political interference -- a process which would not have happened under the prior administration.

This should also put to rest Republican claims that the Department of Justice has somehow been ""weaponized"" against Trump and his cronies.

Coal, often considered the dirtiest fossil fuel, is experiencing a resurgence despite global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. More than two years after climate negotiators attempted to phase out coal, the industry is proving remarkably resilient, fueled by a mix of factors including China's energy insecurity, rising Indian demand, the fallout from the Ukraine war, and challenges in international programmes to reduce fossil fuel reliance.

China's energy insecurity has pushed Beijing to rely more on trusted power sources, including coal, leading to a record-high output last year. Prices, while lower than the 2022 peak after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, remain high, with benchmark Newcastle coal futures trading at around $130 a tonne.

Asia, particularly China and India, will play a significant role in the coal resurgence, accounting for more than 70% of global coal consumption by 2026. These countries, along with Indonesia, are operating new coal power plants and have proposed additional ones, according to Global Energy Monitor.

Rob Bishop, CEO of Australian miner New Hope Corp, highlighted the continued demand for coal in Asia, indicating that coal will remain a significant energy source for the foreseeable future.

This extended reliance on coal is a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against swiftly shifting away from carbon-intensive power, citing benefits in terms of reliability and cost. However, this trend is concerning for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

Despite expectations of coal production plateauing, recent events like power shortages in China and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have bolstered coal demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects coal output to stabilise through 2026, aligning with industry forecasts of a gradual decline.

In China, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates as low-cost reserves have been tapped, leading to the need for deeper and more expensive mines. However, the growth of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, is expected to exceed the growth in electricity consumption, providing a lifeline for coal as a reliable baseload option.

India is forecast to see growth in coal output this year, surpassing 1 billion metric tonnes for the first time, as the country aims to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports.

Indonesia, the top thermal coal exporter, expects stable production for the next two years, driven by domestic demand from the nickel processing sector. However, accelerating the end of coal remains challenging in economies with newer plants, rising energy demand, and a need to create jobs.

Advancements in solar, wind, batteries, and energy storage systems are making renewable energy more affordable and could transform the energy mix in the future. However, the transition away from coal is expected to be gradual, testing previous expectations of a rapid decline in coal usage.

While coal's days are numbered, the world will need operators to mine coal and support the transition to renewable energy over many decades.

Mangaluru: An alarming incident of fuel theft has been reported in the Belthangady region, where perpetrators drilled a hole into a petroleum supply pipeline at Puduvettu and made off with fuel worth lakhs of Rupees. The incident has prompted authorities to take swift action, with a formal complaint filed at the Dharmasthala police station by the affected company.

The station in-charge of Neriya at Petronet MHB Limited, took the initiative to report the theft.

On closer inspection, however, its interior walls are lined with black polythene sheets, which you would not find in a poultry house.

""This is a solar vegetable dryer. The black sheet helps to attract and retain heat from the sun to dry vegetables faster,"" said Emmy Misoo, an officer from the University of Eldoret, about 260 km northwest of Kenya's capital Nairobi, during a recent exhibition in Eldoret, the capital of Uasin Gishu County.

Misoo then lifted a transparent nylon sheet that served as the dryer's door, removed a bunch of dried leaves from the gadget, and placed them in a plastic box.

She then stuffed the dryer with another bunch of freshly harvested traditional vegetables to dry.

""In about eight hours, I will remove them because they would have dried to the desired level,"" Misoo said.

The dryer is one of the solutions researchers in the East African country are presenting to fresh produce farmers and traders to curb post-harvest losses.

The dryers dry various kinds of vegetables for longer shelf life, as well as fruits such as mangoes and bananas, and tubers such as cassava and arrowroot.

Unlike vegetables, however, tubers and fruits must be chopped into small pieces for faster drying.

At least 30 percent of the agricultural produce harvested in Kenya is wasted due to poor post-harvest practices, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

Farm produce includes vegetables and fruits, which farmers harvest in bulk and find difficult to store as they seek markets, leading to waste.

Agriculturalists like Misoo, however, are keen to change this tide through local solutions that farmers can easily adopt and use on the farm.

""The fact that one does not need any specialized knowledge to use it makes it a perfect solution to the problem of food waste,"" Misoo said.

She uses the dryer to preserve traditional vegetables that she grows and exports to friends and relatives abroad, including Australia and the United States.

""Initially, I dried the produce and sent it to my relatives who live in the two countries, but they helped me find a new market and now even buy from me,"" she said, adding that she sends it once a month.

She sells a kilo for 3,000 Kenyan shillings (about 22 U.S. dollars), a cost that includes freight.

It is a business she said she will expand once she has a good source of vegetables.

At the exhibition, Misoo did not sell the gadget but rather educated farmers on how to make and use their own.

Not far from her stand was Isaiah Etemo, a lecturer at Moi University, also in Uasin Gishu County, who has invented a solar dryer that uses hot air to dry various agricultural products.

To dry farm produce, Etemo, who majors in agricultural engineering, said air is contained inside the gadget, creating a greenhouse effect as a fan circulates it.

The machine comes with a moisture meter he calls ""Mootle,"" which he also invented to allow farmers to monitor how their produce is drying.

George Ndirangu, a small-scale herb and spice farmer, was among those interested in solar drying technologies.

Ndirangu said he was keen to adopt solar drying technologies not only to reduce post-harvest losses but also to save costs, as he had been using an electric dryer.

With electricity prices rising in Kenya, Ndirangu said he had to look for alternatives.

""I grow coriander, basil, and rosemary. Most Kenyans don't consume these spices raw, so there's no way around drying and grinding them for business,"" says Ndirangu.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food losses for some fresh horticultural crops, such as bananas in Kenya, are as high as 50 percent at various stages, from production due to disease to transportation due to bruises.

The FAO noted that the solution to food loss should not be more expensive than the food loss itself.

He made the comments during a lengthy interview in which discussed his role as head of Operation Kenova, which is investigating the activities of British Army agent Freddie Scappaticci.

The Belfast man, code-named Stakeknife and who died last year aged 77, was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit which abducted, tortured and murdered dozens of people during Northern Ireland's Troubles.

Operation Kenova's interim report, published earlier this month, found that the running of Stakeknife, who was not named in the document, by the security services, probably resulted in more lives being lost than saved.

It also found that the security forces repeatedly withheld and did not action information about threats to life, abductions and murders in order to protect agents from compromise.

The interim report revealed that while the use of agents undoubtedly saved lives during the Troubles, there were occasions when preventable crimes were allowed to happen and went unsolved as a result of efforts to protect agents.

Scappaticci was named by the Sunday Herald in 2003 as 'Stakeknife' the Army's top informer inside the IRA. Photo: Pacemaker Press.

It also identified several cases of murder where the security forces had advance intelligence but did not intervene in order to protect sources; and found that a lack of legal framework to govern the use of agents during the Troubles created a ""maverick culture"" where agent handling was considered a high-stakes ""dark art"" that was practised ""off the books"".

Reflecting on what lessons people in Scotland should learn from the Troubles and from the Kenova interim report Sir Iain pointed to the close ties between Scotland, the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.

He said: ""What happened in the communities in NI is not something we should ever forget. It is important to remember just the brutality and how so many families were ripped apart.

""Everybody including people in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom should ensure that everything we do supports the peace process.""

He added: ""The United Kingdom and Ireland are so culturally linked, there is the old joke about half of Donegal in Glasgow and half of Glasgow in Donegal.

""So many of us have families and in laws [connected to Northern Ireland and Ireland].""

He added: ""And also I think we need to make sure that anything we do does not allow those Troubles to be reignited, that could be something like how you support your football team, to how you conduct yourself in your day to day business.

""Sectarianism is something I have an absolute revulsion for. I don't think it has any place in a civilised society, it doesn't have any place in Scottish society, and we need to ensure that how we conduct ourselves in Scotland doesn't underpin some of that sectarian hatred that lay behind the Troubles.

""I think it is really important to recognise what went on for the communities of Northern Ireland and for the people we are very close to and make sure that what happened can never be repeated.

""And that everyone in all walks of life, all political parties, and everyone who is committed to democracy, is committed to the peace process.""

The report drew attention to the overall level of violence during the 30 year conflict.

Meta should be legally forced to host news on Facebook and Instagram, a coalition of diverse news publishers say, taking away its key trump card in an escalating war with the Albanese government and Australia's big media companies.

The $2 trillion tech giant has declared it will not sign new deals paying upwards of $70 million a year to media companies to host their content on its platforms. It agreed to at least 13 deals under the threat of the then-Coalition government's news media bargaining code laws three years ago.

At the time, in 2021, Meta said it could pull out of allowing any news on Facebook as a last resort. Campbell Brown, Meta's vice president of media partnerships, wrote on Twitter (now X) that the Australian government had confirmed ""we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to a forced negotiation"".

When Canada tried to force Meta to negotiate payments last year, it blocked all news on Facebook and Instagram.

Now the Public Interest Publishers Alliance, which represents 24 outlets including Neos Kosmosc, Star Observer, Time Out and Australian Jewish News, has called on the federal government to consider a ""must carry"" law to prevent Meta from pulling out of news entirely.

Petrol prices are expected to increase again in April, while diesel prices are projected to decrease.

The mid-month data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF), for the end of week three of March, indicate that petrol prices are showing an under-recovery of around 18 cents per litre - slightly higher than last week - while diesel has an over-recovery of around 32 cents per litre.

As we head into colder months and potentially much higher fuel prices, we need to look at how to make petrol last longer.

This comes after a massive increase in fuel prices in March.

HOW CAN YOU SAVE FUEL?

MasterDrive CEO Eugene Herbert said basic driving adjustments could help with fuel consumption:

""South Africa is also heading into the coldest months of the year, and a temperature dip can also reduce a vehicle's fuel efficiency.

""Much of the research on this is conducted in areas that experience drops in temperatures of up to 25 degrees Celsius, and consequently, the reduction in efficiency can be as high as 12%. While South Africa is highly unlikely to see a 25-degree drop in temperature, there is still an inevitable drop in temperatures and, consequently, reduction in fuel efficiency.""

The development is unprecedented in itself given no sitting chief minister has been arrested in the independent history of India, let alone sign an order from inside the prison.

In the order, Kejriwal directed Delhi Water Minister Atishi to deploy water tankers in sufficient quantity so that there is no shortage in the national capital.

The Delhi chief minister is in the custody of Enforcement Directorate and currently lodged in Tihar jail.

Addressing a press conference, Delhi minister and AAP leader Atishi said that she was in tears after reading the chief minister's note and said that Kejriwal is thinking about people of the national capital despite being in jail.

""Arvind Kejriwal ji has sent me a letter and a direction. On reading it, I was in tears. I kept thinking who is this man, who is in prison, but is still thinking about Delhi residents' water and sewage problems. Only Arvind Kejriwal can do this because he considers himself a family member of Delhi's 2 crore people,"" Atishi said.

She said that Kejriwal has been reviewing the ongoing development works in all departments.

""All the projects and matters have been under his supervision. Now he is under the custody of the central government... Summers are also coming and several places face water supply problems, so he has given directions on how to address the issue... department and the officers will be directed as per the directions given by the CM,"" she said.

The order comes amid a debate over whether a chief minister can continue to work from prison. The BJP has slammed Kejriwal after his party announced that he will not quit and work from inside the jail.

Even though Small, a former vice-president of the company, was awarded $20,647,017 million by the courts five months ago for breach of contract by NiQuan, to date, no money has been paid to him.

On February 1, Small, through his attorney, Anand Ramlogan, initiated a wind-up petition .

Gill, in his application on March 5 to dismiss the wind-up petition, described Small's action as ""oppressive and unfair"".

""There are other more appropriate remedies available to Mr Small to recover any indebtedness owed to him,"" he said in his affidavit.

In his view, Small's challenge to get the sum owed to him will negatively impact the company and its other creditors.

""NiQuan is likely to have meritorious grounds for claiming substantial damages against Mr Small under the tort of malicious prosecution, and that cross-claim against Mr Small is likely to extinguish Mr Small's debt claim against NiQuan,"" he said.

""I further believe that the said petition was filed by Mr Small with the collateral purposes of putting pressure upon NiQuan, particularly under the threat of the prospect of damaging publicity,"" Gill argued.

In Gill's view, Small and his attorneys should have been cognisant that NiQuan could only pay the sum in the judgment if the plant was operational.

""NiQuan's ability to obtain certain approvals necessary for reaching commercial operations and generation of material revenues in United States dollars has been hampered by governmental bureaucracy, impacting an earlier restart of the GTL plant. This has inextricably affected NiQuan's ability to obtain interim debt and/or equity financing, which could have been used towards the satisfaction of any amounts finally adjudged to be due and payable to Mr Small,"" he said.

Gill said until legal matters between the company and the State are resolved, NiQuan will experience cash flow constraints, but the company is not insolvent.

""The bare allegation in the said petition that NiQuan is unable to pay its debts is therefore false,"" he said.

In his wind-up petition, Small wrote to all the financial institutions that NiQuan does business with -- Republic Bank Limited, Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago Limited, First Citizens Bank Limited, RBC Royal Bank (Trinidad & Tobago) Limited, PECU Credit Union Cooperative Society, JMMB Group Trinidad and Tobago, Firstline Securities Limited, and the Central Finance Facility Cooperative Society -- with notice of the judgment and his intention to petition to wind up the company.

""Unfortunately, there has been no response to these letters,"" the petition said.

Last week, all the financial institutions, through their lawyers, sought to have a hearing on Small's matter adjourned until their clients could make representations and be allowed to participate in the proceedings.

For his part, Gill's defence is that while ""NiQuan is experiencing cash flow difficulties, on a balance sheet analysis, its total assets exceed the value of the debt claimed by Mr Small and the aggregate value of all of its debts owed to its other creditors.""

According to Gill, the economic benefit of the damages as a contingent legal asset has been assessed by FTI Consulting, and the range of damages is, at a minimum, the costs incurred and assessed at US$476 million and upwards of US$800 million as a fair market valuation.

Small's judgment, in September 2023, came amid financial problems plaguing the company -- its debt had ballooned -- and has gone offline as a result of no permission to operate from the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries (MEEI) and no natural gas contract for the plant to continue with the project.

The Sunday Guardian understands that NiQuan's reach affects almost all of the country's financial institutions to varying degrees.

Its debt portfolio ranges from financiers to legal challenges to contractors, totalling about US$400 million.

According to documents filed in court, this is what the Sunday Guardian can determine:

1. Republic Bank is the collateral agent under a Short-Term Note Instrument (STNI) issued by NiQuan to approximately 20 noteholders from various countries. ""As at the date of this letter, the STNI covers debt owed by NiQuan to the noteholders in the amount of US$175,000,000,"" the bank's letter to the court said. The Sunday Guardian understands that NiQuan's debt to Republic is US$22 million.

2. According to legal letters, these companies are owed substantial sums: The Junior Sammy Group; Firstline Securities Limited; Central Finance Facility (CFF); PECU Credit Union; JMMB; Teachers Credit Union; and Waterloo Capital Advisors Limited. The sums were not disclosed, but their lawyers have made submissions to have the wind-up petition halted.

3. Sunday Guardian understands that First Citizens and Guardian Asset Management also face exposure to millions of dollars.

4. Massy Energy is also financially exposed to over $100 million.

5. JMMB's investment is significant. Last month, Patrick Ellis, the group chief financial officer of JMMB Group Ltd revealed the full extent of the company's exposure to NiQuan when he delivered the company's unaudited financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, at an investor briefing. ""In terms of our exposure to NiQuan, our principal debt that we have is approximately $65 million, just principal. The exposure itself, if you look at the total exposure, is about $175 to $200 million. The last valuation that we had internally was about $400 million, which was the last one that was done. So if you look at a debt-to-value exposure, it is less than 50 per cent in terms of the overall debt.

""And I know the strategy that is being pursued is one of operation, which has been proven; the plant has produced. So, we are very confident in terms of the outcome and looking forward to its conclusion,"" he had said.

On November 7, 2023, Republic Bank, along with other noteholders, passed a resolution to appoint a steering committee among noteholders to establish a plan for the now-defunct plant moving forward.

To this end, the steering committee has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to develop a plan to rehabilitate the company and make operations to settle its obligations to its various creditor groups.

That timeline is between eight and 12 months.

Republic Bank argued that an order to wind up the company could jeopardise the initiative to the detriment of secured and unsecured creditors.

In making its case to the court, Republic Bank argued that should the company become operational, Small would be repaid.

Gill, in his defence, argued that NiQuan had received a favourable outcome from mediation between the company and the Trinidad and Tobago Upstream Downstream Company (TTUDEOCL), delivered by Lord Neuberger of Abottsbury on January 24, 2024.

Abottsbury had said that the gas agreement was not terminated and that TTUDEOCL was obliged to supply gas to the plant.

On January 23, 2024, TTUDEOCL's attorneys said it did not accept the ruling on the contract and has appealed the matter.

Gill said that NiQuan was now proceeding with its claims against TTUDEOCL under ICC arbitration rules for significant loss, cost, and damages for breach of contract as opposed to specific performance of the gas supply contract.

Gill disclosed that in parallel with the ICC Arbitration proceedings, NiQuan and its parent entity (NiQuan Energy LLC, a United States registered limited liability company) will also be pursuing their claim against the Government of T&T under the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Arbitration Rules for breach of the GORTT of the extant Bilateral Investment Treaty between T&T and the United States of America.

""These parallel legal proceedings are supported by NiQuan's lead financial arranger and noteholders, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In the interim, the NiQuan Gas to Liquids (GTL) plant is under preservation of assets in silent mode. Further, the earlier legal proceedings initiated by NiQuan in the Trinidad courts seeking injunctive and declaratory reliefs against TTUDEOCL and the GORTT to compel the provision of the contracted guaranteed gas supply for NiQuan's GTL plant to restart operations have been discontinued,"" he said.",cnc3.co.tt,news,CNC3,,-0.2,448957632,1,https://www.cnc3.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4684394.jpg,

According to AI Services' Ivan Minford, this reflects the needs of milk producers with year-round calving herds to maintain a constant supply of replacement heifers.

""In addition, farmers with predominantly autumn and winter calving herds must plan to produce a greater number of replacement heifers than they actually need on paper.

""Not every calf survives up to point of calving as a replacement heifer. The use of sexed semen is allowing milk producers to more efficiently plan their breeding programmes.

""As a rule of thumb, they should plan to calve down an additional 10 to 15% of heifer calves above their actual herd replacement figure, simply to cover all eventualities,"" according to Minford.

Autumn and winter calving cows

Ivan is also cautioning producers with autumn and winter calving cows not to switch to beef semen too early this spring.

""The increased use of sexed semen over the past couple of years has brought about a significant increase in the number of replacement dairy heifers that are available right now.

""Milk producers must be thinking two to three years ahead in terms for their breeding programmes. In practical terms, this means sticking to a well thought out, long-term breeding programme, centred on the use of sexed semen.

""A strong push towards the use of beef semen at the present time could well result in a significant under supply of dairy replacement heifers two years hence.""

Ivan made these comments against the backdrop of AI Services launching the company's inaugural 'Holstein Spring Update'.

The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, has reiterated the Federal Government's plan to raise electricity generation from 3,500 Megawatts (MW) to 6,500MW within the next three to six months.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adelabu, who was on a working visit to various power projects in Lagos on Friday, said the aim was to enhance power supply across the country to meet the growing energy demands.

His visit included an inspection of the headquarters of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) and two 20 MVA injection substations at Randle, Surulere, along with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) monitoring rooms.

Adelabu emphasised the urgency of boosting electricity generation capacity, stating, ""3,500 megawatts is not acceptable, and we have plans to increase the capacity to a minimum of 6,000 to 6,500 within the next three to six months.""

He commended EKEDC for its achievements over the past decade and stressed the need for continuous improvement in the power sector to drive economic growth and development effectively.

Highlighting the critical role of the power sector in industrial and economic development, Adelabu compared Nigeria's power generation capacity unfavourably to that of countries like Korea and China, underscoring the need for substantial improvement.

Addressing challenges in the power sector, Adelabu emphasised the importance of prioritising baseload power generation and gradually transitioning to cleaner energy sources to meet the nation's energy needs effectively.

He acknowledged the persisting complaints about power outages and urged stakeholders to work collaboratively to address these challenges and improve service delivery.

Adelabu outlined the government's strategy to prioritise service provision to customers in higher billing bands while gradually extending improved services to all segments through strategic infrastructure investments.

Recognising the role of Distribution Companies (DisCos) in customer service, Adelabu said it was important to ensure proactive engagement and efficient operations at this level to address consumer needs effectively.

He stressed the need for comprehensive reforms and transformation in all segments of the power sector, focusing on issues such as metering, vandalism, debt collection, and customer relations.

Adelabu highlighted the necessity of stimulating demand through customer engagement to ensure effective utilisation of generated power and underscored the importance of efficient distribution to prevent wastage.

The minister noted the government's commitment to enhancing the sector's performance through substantial investments in infrastructure and efficient customer response.

In response to the minister's visit, Oritsedere Otubu, Chairman of EKEDC, commended the government's efforts to improve power supply and expressed the company's commitment to supporting the initiative.

Dr Tinuade Sanda, CEO of EKEDC, said the company would continue to collaborate with government agencies and consumers to protect power assets and curb vandalism within its operations.

Sanda said that the company, in the last six months, had invested over four billion Naira on transformers, cables and rehabilitation over 352 feeders to ensure stable supply during the rainy season.

She added that the debt profile of the company in the last 10 years stood at over ₦131 billion, inclusive of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).

The facility, Europe's largest nuclear energy site, was seized by Russian troops in the first days of the war but is powered by Ukrainian lines.

""This situation is extremely dangerous and risks sparking an emergency situation"", said Ukraine's atomic energy operator Energoatom.

In the event that the final power line is cut, it said the plant will be ""on the verge of another blackout, which is a serious violation of the conditions of safe operation of the plant"".

Since the beginning of the war, the Zaporizhzhia power plant has suffered multiple blackouts, falling back on emergency diesel generators and safety systems.

""In case of their failure, a threat of a nuclear and radiation accident will emerge,"" said Energoatom.

According to Zaporizhzhia's governor, 12 Russian missiles hit the region early Friday, destroying several houses and injuring an unknown number of people.

""According to initial reports, seven houses were destroyed, 35 were damaged,"" Ivan Fedorov wrote on Telegram, adding that people had been injured.

BT23 delves into available feedstocks poised for the production of biofuels aimed at decarbonizing transportation and industrial sectors.

The assessment evaluates varying market maturities to estimate biomass production capacities, pricing, and geographic distribution from around 60 sources. These include winter oilseed crops, forestry waste to mitigate wildfires, dedicated energy crops, ocean-farmed macroalgae, urban waste, and CO2 from industrial emissions. Emerging sources like algae could further augment biomass supplies by 250 million tons yearly, contingent on economic feasibility.

Currently, the U.S. utilizes approximately 342 million tons of biomass annually, contributing to 5% of the nation's energy needs. With an optimal market condition offering between 1.1 and 1.5 billion tons of biomass, the U.S. could potentially generate 60 to 85 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, achieving the goal of fully meeting the aviation sector's fuel requirements by 2050. This biomass could also be instrumental in generating sufficient electricity to supplant current fossil fuel-based power generation.

The report underscores the multifaceted sources required for biomass supply and pinpoints biomass production opportunities at the county level, considering local circumstances and emerging technologies. It provides resources and tools via the DOE's Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework website.

""An economy centered on clean, sustainable biotechnologies and biomanufacturing is achievable,"" stated Stephen Streiffer, ORNL Director. ""BT23 offers critical insights for devising science-based solutions towards a sustainable and affluent future.""

Matthew Langholtz, a natural resources economist at ORNL and project lead, emphasized, ""This report charts a course for realizing a biomass production capacity that aligns with economic and environmental guidelines, including safeguarding food production.""

Farmers and bioeconomy stakeholders are encouraged to explore the report for biomass production prospects. Perennial crops like poplar and switchgrass, requiring lesser water and fertilizer, alongside winter oilseed crops, could enhance farm incomes. Urban waste recovery also promotes a circular economy.

Spanning two decades, this series of reports have provided foundational data influencing local to national policy and decision-making.

Today, Jossou uses computer simulations for rational materials design, AI-aided purposeful development of cladding materials and fuels for next-generation nuclear reactors. As one of the shared faculty hires between the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and departments across MIT, his appointment recognizes his commitment to computing for climate and the environment.

A well-rounded education in Nigeria

Growing up in Lagos, Jossou knew education was about more than just bookish knowledge, so he was eager to travel and experience other cultures. He would start in his own backyard by traveling across the Niger river and enrolling in Ahmadu Bello University in northern Nigeria. Moving from the south was a cultural education with a different language and different foods. It was here that Jossou got to try and love tuwo shinkafa, a northern Nigerian rice-based specialty, for the first time.

After his undergraduate studies, armed with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, Jossou was among a small cohort selected for a specialty master's training program funded by the World Bank Institute and African Development Bank. The program at the African University of Science and Technology in Abuja, Nigeria, is a pan-African venture dedicated to nurturing homegrown science talent on the continent. Visiting professors from around the world taught intensive three-week courses, an experience which felt like drinking from a fire hose. The program widened Jossou's views and he set his sights on a doctoral program with an emphasis on clean energy systems.

A pivot to nuclear science

While in Nigeria, Jossou learned of Professor Jerzy Szpunar at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who was looking for a student researcher to explore fuels and alloys for nuclear reactors. Before then, Jossou was lukewarm on nuclear energy, but the research sounded fascinating. The Fukushima, Japan, incident was recently in the rearview mirror and Jossou remembered his early determination to address his own country's energy crisis. He was sold on the idea and graduated with a doctoral degree from the University of Saskatchewan on an international dean's scholarship.

Jossou's postdoctoral work registered a brief stint at Brookhaven National Laboratory as staff scientist. He leaped at the opportunity to join MIT NSE as a way of realizing his research interest and teaching future engineers. ""I would really like to conduct cutting-edge research in nuclear materials design and to pass on my knowledge to the next generation of scientists and engineers and there's no better place to do that than at MIT,"" Jossou says.

Merging material science and computational modeling

Jossou's doctoral work on designing nuclear fuels for next-generation reactors forms the basis of research his lab is pursuing at MIT NSE. Nuclear reactors that were built in the 1950s and '60s are getting a makeover in terms of improved accident tolerance. Reactors are not confined to one kind, either: We have micro reactors and are now considering ones using metallic nuclear fuels, Jossou points out. The diversity of options is enough to keep researchers busy testing materials fit for cladding, the lining that prevents corrosion of the fuel and release of radioactive fission products into the surrounding reactor coolant.

The team is also investigating fuels that improve burn-up efficiencies, so they can last longer in the reactor. An intriguing approach has been to immobilize the gas bubbles that arise from the fission process, so they don't grow and degrade the fuel.

Since joining MIT in July 2023, Jossou is setting up a lab that optimizes the composition of accident-tolerant nuclear fuels. He is leaning on his materials science background and looping computer simulations and artificial intelligence in the mix.

Computer simulations allow the researchers to narrow down the potential field of candidates, optimized for specific parameters, so they can synthesize only the most promising candidates in the lab. And AI's predictive capabilities guide researchers on which materials composition to consider next. ""We no longer depend on serendipity to choose our materials, our lab is based on rational materials design,"" Jossou says, ""we can rapidly design advanced nuclear fuels.""

Advancing energy causes in Africa

Now that he is at MIT, Jossou admits the view from the outside is different. He now harbors a different perspective on what Africa needs to address some of its challenges. ""The starting point to solve our problems is not money; it needs to start with ideas,"" he says, ""we need to find highly skilled people who can actually solve problems."" That job involves adding economic value to the rich arrays of raw materials that the continent is blessed with. It frustrates Jossou that Niger, a country rich in raw material for uranium, has no nuclear reactors of its own. It ships most of its ore to France. ""The path forward is to find a way to refine these materials in Africa and to be able to power the industries on that continent as well,"" Jossou says.

Jossou is determined to do his part to eliminate these roadblocks.

Anchored in mentorship, Jossou's solution aims to train talent from Africa in his own lab. He has applied for a MIT Global Experiences MISTI grant to facilitate travel and research studies for Ghanaian scientists. ""The goal is to conduct research in our facility and perhaps add value to indigenous materials,"" Jossou says.

Adding value has been a consistent theme of Jossou's career. He remembers wanting to become a neurosurgeon after reading ""Gifted Hands,"" moved by the personal story of the author, Ben Carson. As Jossou grew older, however, he realized that becoming a doctor wasn't necessarily what he wanted. Instead, he was looking to add value. ""What I wanted was really to take on a career that allows me to solve a societal problem."" The societal problem of clean and safe energy for all is precisely what Jossou is working on today.",nuclearpowerdaily.com,news,Nuclear Power Daily,,0.4509803921568627,448956904,1,https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/molecule-modification-improves-reprocessing-spent-nuclear-fuel-hg.jpg,

While those designs promise significant safety and performance advantages, there's a catch: Molten salt and the impurities within it often corrode metals, ultimately causing them to crack, weaken, and fail. Inside a reactor, key metal components will be exposed not only to molten salt but also simultaneously to radiation, which generally has a detrimental effect on materials, making them more brittle and prone to failure. Will irradiation make metal components inside a molten salt-cooled nuclear reactor corrode even more quickly?

Short and Weiyue Zhou PhD '21, a postdoc in the PSFC, have been investigating that question for eight years. Their recent experimental findings show that certain alloys will corrode more slowly when they're irradiated - and identifying them among all the available commercial alloys can be straightforward.

The first challenge - building a test facility

When Short and Zhou began investigating the effect of radiation on corrosion, practically no reliable facilities existed to look at the two effects at once. The standard approach was to examine such mechanisms in sequence: first corrode, then irradiate, then examine the impact on the material. That approach greatly simplifies the task for the researchers, but with a major trade-off. ""In a reactor, everything is going to be happening at the same time,"" says Short. ""If you separate the two processes, you're not simulating a reactor; you're doing some other experiment that's not as relevant.""

So, Short and Zhou took on the challenge of designing and building an experimental setup that could do both at once. Short credits a team at the University of Michigan for paving the way by designing a device that could accomplish that feat in water, rather than molten salts. Even so, Zhou notes, it took them three years to come up with a device that would work with molten salts. Both researchers recall failure after failure, but the persistent Zhou ultimately tried a totally new design, and it worked. Short adds that it also took them three years to precisely replicate the salt mixture used by industry - another factor critical to getting a meaningful result. The hardest part was achieving and ensuring that the purity was correct by removing critical impurities such as moisture, oxygen, and certain other metals.

As they were developing and testing their setup, Short and Zhou obtained initial results showing that proton irradiation did not always accelerate corrosion but sometimes actually decelerated it. They and others had hypothesized that possibility, but even so, they were surprised. ""We thought we must be doing something wrong,"" recalls Short. ""Maybe we mixed up the samples or something."" But they subsequently made similar observations for a variety of conditions, increasing their confidence that their initial observations were not outliers.

The successful setup

Central to their approach is the use of accelerated protons to mimic the impact of the neutrons inside a nuclear reactor. Generating neutrons would be both impractical and prohibitively expensive, and the neutrons would make everything highly radioactive, posing health risks and requiring very long times for an irradiated sample to cool down enough to be examined. Using protons would enable Short and Zhou to examine radiation-altered corrosion both rapidly and safely.

Key to their experimental setup is a test chamber that they attach to a proton accelerator. To prepare the test chamber for an experiment, they place inside it a thin disc of the metal alloy being tested on top of a a pellet of salt. During the test, the entire foil disc is exposed to a bath of molten salt. At the same time, a beam of protons bombards the sample from the side opposite the salt pellet, but the proton beam is restricted to a circle in the middle of the foil sample. ""No one can argue with our results then,"" says Short. ""In a single experiment, the whole sample is subjected to corrosion, and only a circle in the center of the sample is simultaneously irradiated by protons. We can see the curvature of the proton beam outline in our results, so we know which region is which.""

The results with that arrangement were unchanged from the initial results. They confirmed the researchers' preliminary findings, supporting their controversial hypothesis that rather than accelerating corrosion, radiation would actually decelerate corrosion in some materials under some conditions. Fortunately, they just happen to be the same conditions that will be experienced by metals in molten salt-cooled reactors.

Why is that outcome controversial? A closeup look at the corrosion process will explain. When salt corrodes metal, the salt finds atomic-level openings in the solid, seeps in, and dissolves salt-soluble atoms, pulling them out and leaving a gap in the material - a spot where the material is now weak. ""Radiation adds energy to atoms, causing them to be ballistically knocked out of their positions and move very fast,"" explains Short. So, it makes sense that irradiating a material would cause atoms to move into the salt more quickly, increasing the rate of corrosion. Yet in some of their tests, the researchers found the opposite to be true.

Experiments with ""model"" alloys

The researchers' first experiments in their novel setup involved ""model"" alloys consisting of nickel and chromium, a simple combination that would give them a first look at the corrosion process in action. In addition, they added europium fluoride to the salt, a compound known to speed up corrosion. In our everyday world, we often think of corrosion as taking years or decades, but in the more extreme conditions of a molten salt reactor it can noticeably occur in just hours. The researchers used the europium fluoride to speed up corrosion even more without changing the corrosion process. This allowed for more rapid determination of which materials, under which conditions, experienced more or less corrosion with simultaneous proton irradiation.

The use of protons to emulate neutron damage to materials meant that the experimental setup had to be carefully designed and the operating conditions carefully selected and controlled. Protons are hydrogen atoms with an electrical charge, and under some conditions the hydrogen could chemically react with atoms in the sample foil, altering the corrosion response, or with ions in the salt, making the salt more corrosive. Therefore, the proton beam had to penetrate the foil sample but then stop in the salt as soon as possible. Under these conditions, the researchers found they could deliver a relatively uniform dose of radiation inside the foil layer while also minimizing chemical reactions in both the foil and the salt.

Tests showed that a proton beam accelerated to 3 million electron-volts combined with a foil sample between 25 and 30 microns thick would work well for their nickel-chromium alloys. The temperature and duration of the exposure could be adjusted based on the corrosion susceptibility of the specific materials being tested.

Optical images of samples examined after tests with the model alloys showed a clear boundary between the area that was exposed only to the molten salt and the area that was also exposed to the proton beam. Electron microscope images focusing on that boundary showed that the area that had been exposed only to the molten salt included dark patches where the molten salt had penetrated all the way through the foil, while the area that had also been exposed to the proton beam showed almost no such dark patches.

To confirm that the dark patches were due to corrosion, the researchers cut through the foil sample to create cross sections. In them, they could see tunnels that the salt had dug into the sample. ""For regions not under radiation, we see that the salt tunnels link the one side of the sample to the other side,"" says Zhou. ""For regions under radiation, we see that the salt tunnels stop more or less halfway and rarely reach the other side. So we verified that they didn't penetrate the whole way.""

The results ""exceeded our wildest expectations,"" says Short. ""In every test we ran, the application of radiation slowed corrosion by a factor of two to three times.""

More experiments, more insights

In subsequent tests, the researchers more closely replicated commercially available molten salt by omitting the additive (europium fluoride) that they had used to speed up corrosion, and they tweaked the temperature for even more realistic conditions. ""In carefully monitored tests, we found that by raising the temperature by 100 degrees Celsius, we could get corrosion to happen about 1,000 times faster than it would in a reactor,"" says Short.

Images from experiments with the nickel-chromium alloy plus the molten salt without the corrosive additive yielded further insights. Electron microscope images of the side of the foil sample facing the molten salt showed that in sections only exposed to the molten salt, the corrosion is clearly focused on the weakest part of the structure - the boundaries between the grains in the metal. In sections that were exposed to both the molten salt and the proton beam, the corrosion isn't limited to the grain boundaries but is more spread out over the surface. Experimental results showed that these cracks are shallower and less likely to cause a key component to break.

Short explains the observations. Metals are made up of individual grains inside which atoms are lined up in an orderly fashion. Where the grains come together there are areas - called grain boundaries - where the atoms don't line up as well. In the corrosion-only images, dark lines track the grain boundaries. Molten salt has seeped into the grain boundaries and pulled out salt-soluble atoms. In the corrosion-plus-irradiation images, the damage is more general. It's not only the grain boundaries that get attacked but also regions within the grains.

So, when the material is irradiated, the molten salt also removes material from within the grains. Over time, more material comes out of the grains themselves than from the spaces between them. The removal isn't focused on the grain boundaries; it's spread out over the whole surface. As a result, any cracks that form are shallower and more spread out, and the material is less likely to fail.

Testing commercial alloys

The experiments described thus far involved model alloys - simple combinations of elements that are good for studying science but would never be used in a reactor. In the next series of experiments, the researchers focused on three commercially available alloys that are composed of nickel, chromium, iron, molybdenum, and other elements in various combinations.

Results from the experiments with the commercial alloys showed a consistent pattern - one that confirmed an idea that the researchers had going in: the higher the concentration of salt-soluble elements in the alloy, the worse the radiation-induced corrosion damage. Radiation will increase the rate at which salt-soluble atoms such as chromium leave the grain boundaries, hastening the corrosion process. However, if there are more not-soluble elements such as nickel present, those atoms will go into the salt more slowly. Over time, they'll accumulate at the grain boundary and form a protective coating that blocks the grain boundary - a ""self-healing mechanism that decelerates the rate of corrosion,"" say the researchers.

Thus, if an alloy consists mostly of atoms that don't dissolve in molten salt, irradiation will cause them to form a protective coating that slows the corrosion process. But if an alloy consists mostly of atoms that dissolve in molten salt, irradiation will make them dissolve faster, speeding up corrosion. As Short summarizes, ""In terms of corrosion, irradiation makes a good alloy better and a bad alloy worse.""

Real-world relevance plus practical guidelines

Short and Zhou find their results encouraging. In a nuclear reactor made of ""good"" alloys, the slowdown in corrosion will probably be even more pronounced than what they observed in their proton-based experiments because the neutrons that inflict the damage won't chemically react with the salt to make it more corrosive. As a result, reactor designers could push the envelope more in their operating conditions, allowing them to get more power out of the same nuclear plant without compromising on safety.

However, the researchers stress that there's much work to be done. Many more projects are needed to explore and understand the exact corrosion mechanism in specific alloys under different irradiation conditions. In addition, their findings need to be replicated by groups at other institutions using their own facilities. ""What needs to happen now is for other labs to build their own facilities and start verifying whether they get the same results as we did,"" says Short. To that end, Short and Zhou have made the details of their experimental setup and all of their data freely available online. ""We've also been actively communicating with researchers at other institutions who have contacted us,"" adds Zhou. ""When they're planning to visit, we offer to show them demonstration experiments while they're here.""

But already their findings provide practical guidance for other researchers and equipment designers. For example, the standard way to quantify corrosion damage is by ""mass loss,"" a measure of how much weight the material has lost. But Short and Zhou consider mass loss a flawed measure of corrosion in molten salts. ""If you're a nuclear plant operator, you usually care whether your structural components are going to break,"" says Short. ""Our experiments show that radiation can change how deep the cracks are, when all other things are held constant. The deeper the cracks, the more likely a structural component is to break, leading to a reactor failure.""

In addition, the researchers offer a simple rule for identifying good metal alloys for structural components in molten salt reactors. Manufacturers provide extensive lists of available alloys with different compositions, microstructures, and additives. Faced with a list of options for critical structures, the designer of a new nuclear fission or fusion reactor can simply examine the composition of each alloy being offered. The one with the highest content of corrosion-resistant elements such as nickel will be the best choice. Inside a nuclear reactor, that alloy should respond to a bombardment of radiation not by corroding more rapidly but by forming a protective layer that helps block the corrosion process. ""That may seem like a trivial result, but the exact threshold where radiation decelerates corrosion depends on the salt chemistry, the density of neutrons in the reactor, their energies, and a few other factors,"" says Short. ""Therefore, the complete guidelines are a bit more complicated. But they're presented in a straightforward way that users can understand and utilize to make a good choice for the molten salt-based reactor they're designing.""

However, even seasoned developers can encounter perplexing issues related to resource constraints. This blog post delves into common Kubernetes troubleshooting scenarios centered on resource constraints, offering insight and practical examples to navigate these challenges.

Kubernetes manages resources like CPU and memory to ensure that applications have what they need to run. However, improperly configured resource limits and requests can lead to issues such as pod evictions, insufficient resources, and pods stuck in pending status. Let's explore these issues and their solutions.

Scenario 1: Pods Getting Evicted

Problem: Your application pods are getting evicted unexpectedly, disrupting service availability.

Cause: Kubernetes evicts pods when a node runs out of memory (OOM) or disk space. If your pods are not specifying resource requests and limits, they may consume more resources than available, leading to eviction.

Solution: Define resource requests and limits in your pod specifications. This helps Kubernetes make better decisions about where to place pods and when to evict them.

Cause: This often happens when the cluster does not have enough resources to fulfill the request.

Solution: Use the command to check the events for the pod. If you see errors related to insufficient resources, you may need to adjust the pod's resource requests or add more nodes to your cluster.

Cause: This can occur if there are no nodes that satisfy the pod's scheduling requirements, such as taints and tolerations, node selectors, or if the requested resources are too high.

Solution: Review the pod's scheduling constraints and adjust them as needed. Ensure the resource requests are realistic and that there are nodes available that meet the requirements.

Tips for Managing Resource Constraints

Navigating resource constraints in Kubernetes requires a fine balance between specifying what your applications need and what your cluster can provide. By understanding common issues related to resource constraints and applying best practices for resource management, you can ensure your Kubernetes applications run smoothly and efficiently. Regular monitoring, coupled with a proactive approach to adjusting resources, will help you maintain a healthy and responsive Kubernetes environment.",sourabhkalal.medium.com,news,Medium,Sourabhh Kalal,0.1137254901960785,448956825,1,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*85S_qYuuTNKJDkqI-dwWGg.jpeg,eng-9420554

Beijing | China's economy is at a ""fork in the road"" between choosing between past policies or ""pro-market reforms"" to unlock growth, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday, as calls grow for Beijing to do more to boost domestic demand.

Speaking at China's flagship international business conference in Beijing, Ms Georgieva said the global economy showed remarkable resilience to shocks, but was headed for growth that was ""weak by historical standards"" in the medium term as low productivity growth and high debt levels curbed progress.

""China faces a fork in the road - rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" she told the China Development Forum, according to a copy of her speech.

Solar generation peaked at 4,162MW, with agreements securing additional power capacity. New power stations are operational to meet increasing demands.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu's electricity demand surged to a record high of 19,409MW on Friday, surpassing last year's peak demand (19,387MW on April 20, 2023) a month earlier than expected. By April, Tangedco officials expect the state's demand to go up by another 8%.

Officials say the early spike in demand is due to rising temperatures pushing up use of fans and air conditioners, and sanction of a three-phase power supply for irrigation.""The maximum demand was recorded around 11 am on Friday, coinciding with peak solar hours. We met the need without any difficulty as solar power generation was good,"" said an official.

When demand peaked, generation from solar energy was 4,162MW, nearly touching the maximum capacity of 4,200MW. Tangedco officials anticipate the peak may exceed 20,000 MW by the month-end or early April, and go up to 21,000 MW this summer.

The surge in demand began in Jan. Officials say it is normal to see an 8% year-on-year increase in power demand. The power demand in Jan went up by 11% compared to Jan 2023. In Feb there was a 9% increase compared to Feb 2023. In March and April, the surge is likely to hover over 9%, officials said. To meet demand, Tangedco has entered into short-term power purchase agreements with gencoms and power swapping agreements with northeastern states, securing an additional 4,321MW for April. To keep costs in check, power swap agreements have been signed.

North Chennai Thermal Power Station Stage III, which was recently inaugurated with an 800MW capacity, has commenced production at 260MW. This output is expected to increase after March 26, following the arrival of imported coal. Additionally, Vallur thermal plant units 1 and 2, which together have a capacity of 700 megawatts, will start generating power by March-end.

Oda's One Piece is absolutely spectacular, and, over the years, fans have seen him craft some of the most intriguing fighting styles and power-ups to excite the fans.

Related One Piece: 8 Devil Fruits That Can Kill In One-Shot These powerful One Piece devul fruits can kill in one shot.

While some power-ups are quite straightforward, others actually have a big asking price. Fans have seen quite a lot of One Piece power-ups that end up having adverse effects on the user themselves. These power-ups are rare, however, the trade-off made for them can be worth it sometimes.

9 Gear Second

Burned Luffy's Life Force Before The Timeskip

Gear Second is one of the very best power-ups invented by Luffy, and it is still one of the very best abilities that he has up his sleeve right now. Luffy invented Gear Second by making use of his rubber body and making his heart pump blood faster through his body.

This power-up made him quite exceptional, however, as put by Rob Lucci, Luffy was chipping away at his life by using this power. This was especially true when he combined it with Gear Third, and even the Straw Hats believed that this was having a negative impact on his life force. Thankfully, after the timeskip, Luffy has mastered Gear Second to a level where he can activate it in just parts of his body to avoid facing the negative side effects.

8 Gear Fourth

Burns Luffy's Stamina and Haki Too Harshly

Just like Gear Second, Gear 4 is another power of Luffy that has an adverse effect on him. Gear Fourth is quite an incredible ability, however, the strain that it puts on his body is way too much.

This is especially true and Luffy overuses his Haki and spreads it all over his body. The Haki consumption and the rate at which it burns his energy is way too high, and eventually, it ends up paralyzing him if overused.

7 King Of Hell: Three Sword Style

Can Kill Zoro If Overused

Zoro's King of Hell: Three Sword Style is an amazing power. He utilized this for the very first time in his fight against King in the Wano arc.l While this power was certainly spectacular, it clearly needed a big trade-off.

Simply put, this power-up drains Zoro's Haki, and at the same time, his life force as well. If overused, it can actually go on to kill Zoro, which just goes to show the severity of it. Zoro completely leaves his Haki unregulated in this form, which means that Enma can suck up as much as it wants.

6 Devil Fruit Awakenings

Take A Toll On Energy In Some Cases

Devil Fruit awakenings are powers that can be considered to be key in the Final Saga of One Piece. Essentially, Devil Fruits have a level that can be unlocked by those who can push them beyond all those limits. According to Kaido, when the mind and body catch up with the ability, then, a Devil Fruit awakens.

Usually, Devil Fruit awakenings cost a lot of stamina, and end up adversely affecting the body of the user. This was confirmed by Luffy, through his Gear 5, where Kaido suggested that if he overused this power, he would actually die. It was also confirmed through the likes of Kid and Law, both of which said that they use their Awakenings as a last stand, when they had no other choice.

5 Monster Point

Cripples Chopper When Overused

Chopper's Monster Point is a very intriguing power-up that fans have seen on many occasions in One Piece. This power-up, while strong, does have its side effects as well.

Copper used to lose the ability to move after utilizing Monster Point. Even worse, once he upgraded Monster Point and increased the time limit to 30 minutes, he suffered from a different side effect, which was being turned into a Baby Geezer.

4 Big Mom's Soul Sacrifice

Big Mom Removes Her Own Lifespan

To combat the threat of Kid and Law, Big Mom decided to showcase the true terror of her Soru Soru no Mi to them in Wano. Essentially, Big Mom decided to sacrifice quite a bit of her lifespan and consume it to gain further power.

When utilized, Big Mom grew tremendously in terms of strength and size. This version of Big Mom was strong enough to push back both Kid and Law in combat at once.

3 Hero Water

The Elixir From Arabasta

Not many fans of One Piece would remember Hero Water, which was introduced in the Arabasta Saga.

Hero of water was, simply put, an elixir that increased the strength of the individual consuming it manifold. However, the downside to utilizing this power was that in 5 minutes, the user would end up dying.

2 Dials

Some Dials Are Lethal To Use

While not all Dials can be considered to be dangerous to the user, there are some that certainly are. These usually fall along the lines of Impact and Reject Dials. Both of these Dials deal damage to the enemy at a tremendous scale.

However, they also have a very sharp recoil, which means that the user themselves feels a lot of pain that can potentially even dislocate their bones. This is especially true in the case of Reject Dials, which can obliterate the arm of the person who is utilizing it.

1 Energy Steroid

The National Treasure Of Fishman Island

Introduced in the Fish Man Island arc, energy steroids were known to be the Treasure of the Fishman Island. These energy steroids doubled the power of anyone who consumed them. The more pills they consumed, the more this bonus would stack. It is believed that by the time of the conclusion of the fight against Luffy, Hody had grown 320 times stronger than an average Fishman, which just goes to show how tremendous his level of strength was.

That said, these pills had a negative side effect, and that was premature old age. After overdosing on so many pills, Hody and his group were turned into old and dying individuals.

He further said the growth rate in Tier II and III cities is higher, and there is a lot of saturation happening in urban centres.

''Growth is being fuelled by these tier II and III towns,'' Gupta said.

Carlos Sainz came home to win at Albert Park, becoming the first non-Red Bull driver to win a race since his Ferrari came home to win the night race in south-east Asia.

And just like that race, when he crashed out trying to make a move on the final lap, Russell saw himself failing to finish after a bad collision with the wall on his second-last trip around the lake.

The Briton lost control chasing Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso heading into the turn 6 and 7 complex and went off into the gravel trap.

Losing downforce he got on the brakes, oversteered and went wide, catching the wall and ending up with the car on its side.

Russell was OK and escaped the Mercedes safely but missed out on a points finish.

He would've come home seventh but after Lewis Hamilton's mechanical retirement early in the race it gave the team a double DNF.

But do we really know who will actually receive them?

This is a modern-day conundrum.

We don't know when we are going to die, and as such, do not know our children's circumstances at that time.

They could be with a loving partner; they could be in a violent relationship or in a household with drugs, or they could be in a broken relationship.

How will grandchildren be looked after and what happens with blended families?

These are all vexing questions and ones which the traditional will which passes assets to the named beneficiary may not property handle.

Once your assets pass from you on death to the nominated person, they are available to liquidators, family law courts and there are punitive (60%) tax implications on income/capital gains that go to children under 18 if they did not have ""work"" for this income/capital gains.

So what is the answer?

While there is no 'one size fits all', there is an alternative direction and for once it is relatively simple and should not be cost-prohibitive for the majority.

That solution is a Testamentary Trust.

This is a different way to pass assets and unlike the more traditional will, assets do not go to the beneficiary; rather they go to a trust and the control of the trust is with the beneficiary.

As normal, on death, there is no Capital Gains Tax or Stamp Duty liability on the transfer.

You give your children control, not ownership.

They can be free to sell, keep, or share the assets or benefits within their desired family group, unlike a normal will which restricts these benefits to only the new owner.

The difference is your children do not own the assets, so in a liquidation or family law court proceedings the assets in the testamentary trust, if properly drawn up, would not normally be available.

They are protected. Also, income/capital gains directed to a minor child from a Testamentary Trust are taxable at adult tax rates with the tax-free threshold applying i.e. no 60% tax.

This sort of treatment can even occur between spouses to protect the assets of children.

So if the surviving spouse remarries and dies, assets can be retained for the original children and not the new partner (and family) of your surviving spouse.

A Testamentary Trust must be part of the will when prepared.

The bulk of the will remains the same i.e. which assets, who gets what (now controls), and any other special requirements but the new addition is the Testamentary Trust.

Your executor cannot put a Testamentary Trust in place if you did not include the requirement in your will.

Be prepared and get professional advice so as to leave a lasting legacy to whom you intend.

Oil marketing companies (OMCs) in India have announced the daily fuel prices for March 23. The prices are adjusted every morning at 6 am based on global crude oil prices and foreign exchange rates. Despite recent reductions, fuel prices continue to remain high, impacting consumers across the country.

Here is a city-wise breakdown of petrol and diesel prices as of March 23:

Mumbai:

- Petrol: Rs 104.21 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 92.15 per litre

Delhi:

- Petrol: Rs 94.72 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 87.62 per litre

Chennai:

- Petrol: Rs 100.75 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 92.34 per litre

Kolkata:

- Petrol: Rs 103.94 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 90.76 per litre

Noida:

- Petrol: Rs 94.83 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 87.96 per litre

Lucknow:

- Petrol: Rs 94.65 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 87.76 per litre

Bengaluru:

- Petrol: Rs 99.84 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 85.93 per litre

Hyderabad:

- Petrol: Rs 107.41 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 95.65 per litre

Jaipur:

- Petrol: Rs 104.88 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 90.36 per litre

Trivandrum:

- Petrol: Rs 107.56 per litre

- Diesel: Rs 96.43 per litre

Fuel prices are influenced by various factors, including the global price of crude oil, the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the US dollar, and taxes imposed by central and state governments. The recent reduction in fuel prices across India followed a period of stability since May 2022. However, prices remain high due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and other factors affecting the global oil market.

The government oversees fuel prices through mechanisms such as excise tax, base pricing, and price caps. Consumers are advised to stay informed about daily fuel price adjustments to manage their expenses effectively.

Impact of Crude Oil Prices:

The global price of crude oil is a major factor influencing petrol and diesel prices in India. Any fluctuations in crude oil prices directly affect the cost of production, transportation, and distribution of petrol and diesel.

Exchange Rate Influence:

As India is a major importer of crude oil, the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the US dollar plays a significant role in determining fuel prices. A weaker rupee against the dollar can lead to higher fuel prices for consumers.

Taxation:

Both central and state governments impose taxes on petrol and diesel, which vary across states. These taxes contribute significantly to the final retail price of fuel.

Demand and Supply Dynamics:

The demand for petrol and diesel in India also impacts their prices. If demand exceeds supply, prices are likely to rise. Conversely, lower demand can lead to a decrease in prices.

Refining Costs:

The process of refining crude oil into petrol and diesel incurs additional expenses, which can fluctuate based on factors such as the type of crude oil used and the efficiency of the refinery.

While recent reductions in fuel prices have provided some relief to consumers, the ongoing volatility in global oil markets underscores the need for consumers to remain vigilant about daily price changes. Monitoring fuel prices and adopting fuel-efficient practices can help mitigate the impact of high fuel costs.

Kardashian posted snaps of herself earlier this week, captioning them, ""On my way to go find Kate"".

Kate on Friday, March 22, revealed in a video post that he has been diagnosed with cancer. She had stayed away from the public eye for several days after an abdominal surgery she underwent, sparking rumours and conspiracy theories.

'I hope you publicly apologize to the princess'

Many commented on Kardashian's post now, demanding that she apologise. ""I think an apology is needed !"" one user commented. On user said, ""You should probably take this down now,"" while another wrote, ""Can you please go find an apology instead??"" ""After the news of her having cancer has been revealed, you should really take this down. It's extremely insensitive and you owe our princess an apology,"" one user said.

""Well I guess you found her in the chemo ward Kim. Your caption is distasteful,"" one user said, while another said, ""I hope you publicly apologize to the princess of wales"". ""Now she's confirmed she has cancer, are you going to take this down? So distasteful,"" one user said. Another wrote, ""Pathetic insensitive post. My heart goes out to Kate Middleton. On another note I mean is Kim K still relevant? Just asking..."". One user wrote, ""Really can not believe this post is still here!! Shows I don't care attitude"".

Announcing her diagnosis, Kate said in a video, ""In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London, and at the time, it was thought that my condition was noncancerous. The surgery was successful.""

""However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I am now in the early stages of that treatment,"" she added.",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,View All,-0.2,448954847,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/24/1600x900/Untitled_1711258254976_1711258255114.jpg,

This follows a press conference by Mayaro MP Rushton Paray at the Couva Point Lisas Chamber of Commerce Conference Hall on Friday, where he demanded that Kamla Persad-Bissessar call the Natex election when it's due in June.

So far, Naparima MP Rodney Charles and Cumuto/Manzanilla MP Rai Ragbir agree with Paray and have given him their support.

Guardian Media reached out to the 15 other MPs, 12 of whom have endorsed the stance of Persad-Bissessar. Chaguanas West MP Dinesh Rambally declined to comment, while attempts to reach two others, Tabaquite MP Anita Haynes and Chaguanas East MP Vandana Mohit, were unsuccessful.

Deputy political leader and Oropouche East MP, Dr Roodal Moonilal assured that internal elections will be held according to the party's constitution.

""There has been no discussion or decision to postpone any elections. Regrettably, MP Paray had a public discourse on this matter, which is premature and can only seek to destabilise and undermine the party and, in so doing, fully assist fully the PNM.""

He said, ""We have been able to place the Rowley Government on the back foot, and we are in pole position to return to national office. This is not a time to play the fool. Our country's future is at stake.""

Princes Town MP Barry Padarath said Paray's attacks against the political leader were unwarranted and baseless. ""Rushton Paray is a political neophyte and a coward who is only interested in internal elections to further his misguided and warped political ambition,"" he said. As a member of the current executive, he said they are engaged in preparations for a general election.

He said Paray was in for a hell of a ride if he thinks that the UNC will be allowed to fall into the hands of the PNM.

Couva South MP Rudranath Indarsingh gave this advice to his colleague, ""Don't rush the brush, and at the end of the day, all decisions in politics are guided by party discipline and collective responsibility, and I am sure that the UNC will continue to go forward as a disciplined party in dealing with the PNM Government.

Reminding his colleagues that at this time they must remain focused on key issues affecting people and the ""uncaring"" PNM Government, Couva North MP Ravi Ratiram said, ""Attempting to divert our focus and attention away from the key issues affecting our citizens, without any rationale, is completely absurd, selfish, and reckless. These actions should be viewed as self-motivated, mischievous, and malicious and should be ignored by all.""

Caroni East MP Rishad Seecheran said the political leader has exhibited an incomparable track record of championing the democratic ideals that are fundamental to their cause, and therefore, the issue of internal elections holds no relevance at this time.

Oropouche West MP Davendranath Tancoo, meanwhile, said the timing of Paray's action was extremely curious and misinformed. Noting that the UNC internal elections is not due for several months, he said, ""I have no issue with anyone having ambitions to lead. However, to call a press conference to attack the Natex and leadership of the UNC at a time when it is already publicly known that the PNM is in general election mode, as is the UNC and every other political party, suggests another motive."" He urged his colleagues to put their ambitions aside and continue the work towards removing the PNM Government from office.

St Augustine MP Khadijah Ameen said, ""I think Mr Paray is so misguided to try to destabilise the party when we are in the midst of preparation for a general election.

Noting that nominations close off on April 11, she said, ""I think for Mr Paray to ask the membership of the UNC to drop all of our preparations for general election and focus on an internal elections not even due because he says so, to me it is playing in the hands of the PNM. My question to him is whether he is UNC or PNM.""

Barataria/San Juan MP Saddam Hosein said all arms of the party's machinery are preparing to confront the imminent general election to remove the ""worst Government in our nation's history,"" but certain officials are trying to distract from that goal. Having served from a street captain to a youth officer and then MP, he reminded others that they cannot hope to ascend to the levels of leadership as ""one must first creep before one can walk.""

Caroni Central MP Arnold Ram had some questions for Paray.

""What has my colleague done for the UNC in the last nine years? Which marginal has he worked in? What if any resources he provided or brought to the party?""

He implored Paray to read the party's constitution or have his attorneys interpret it for him.

Deputy Political Leader and Pointe-a-Pierre MP David Lee said the executive has been functioning with intensity given the inroads the party made in the last local government elections, and they must remain ""laser-focused"" on the only political enemy, which is the PNM.

Having served as deputy political leader in the previous Natex, Fyzabad MP Lackram Boodram said he can attest to the extent to which the leadership of Persad-Bissessar has transformed and improved the UNC.

""Additionally, there has been no indication from the Natex regarding any postponement of internal elections,"" he added.

Moruga/Tableland MP Michelle Benjamin also indicated her support for Persad-Bissessar.

In response to Paray, Persad-Bissessar said elections will be governed by the party's constitution. ""You have some wannabes; I wish them good luck, and I say we remain committed to the party's constitution. We follow the party's constitution, and anyone who wants to jump the gun will wait their turn. Now is not the time for that. We must stay laser-focused on doing what we can to rescue the people of this country.""",cnc3.co.tt,news,CNC3,,0.1294117647058823,448954778,1,https://www.cnc3.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/app-settings-logo-dark.png,

Deputy po­lit­i­cal leader and Oropouche East MP, Dr Roodal Mooni­lal as­sured that in­ter­nal elec­tions will be held ac­cord­ing to the par­ty's con­sti­tu­tion.

""There has been no dis­cus­sion or de­ci­sion to post­pone any elec­tions. Re­gret­tably, MP Paray had a pub­lic dis­course on this mat­ter, which is pre­ma­ture and can on­ly seek to desta­bilise and un­der­mine the par­ty and, in so do­ing, ful­ly as­sist ful­ly the PNM.""

As a mem­ber of the cur­rent ex­ec­u­tive, he said they are en­gaged in prepa­ra­tions for a gen­er­al elec­tion.

He said Paray was in for a hell of a ride if he thinks that the UNC will be al­lowed to fall in­to the hands of the PNM.

Cou­va South MP Rudranath In­dars­ingh gave this ad­vice to his col­league, ""Don't rush the brush, and at the end of the day, all de­ci­sions in pol­i­tics are guid­ed by par­ty dis­ci­pline and col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­i­ty, and I am sure that the UNC will con­tin­ue to go for­ward as a dis­ci­plined par­ty in deal­ing with the PNM Gov­ern­ment.

'Tim­ing ex­treme­ly cu­ri­ous'

Oropouche West MP Dav­en­dranath Tan­coo, mean­while, said the tim­ing of Paray's ac­tion was ex­treme­ly cu­ri­ous and mis­in­formed. Not­ing that the UNC in­ter­nal elec­tions is not due for sev­er­al months, he said, ""I have no is­sue with any­one hav­ing am­bi­tions to lead.

Ca­roni Cen­tral MP Arnold Ram had some ques­tions for Paray.

""What has my col­league done for the UNC in the last nine years? Which mar­gin­al has he worked in? What if any re­sources he pro­vid­ed or brought to the par­ty?""

He im­plored Paray to read the par­ty's con­sti­tu­tion or have his at­tor­neys in­ter­pret it for him.

Indeed, almost the entire world 'is not surprised at all' by Russian President Vladimir Putin's retention of power at the recent presidential poll. Given Putin's tight grip on the Russian political system, his prolongation of power was only to be expected.

Since independent and impartial verification is not possible to the desired degree, it will remain an open question whether the presidential election was free and fair. However, the fact that what we have in Russia is an authoritarian system of government, which is intolerant of dissent, points to the non-existence in Russia of core democratic values and institutions.

This columnist wishes it was otherwise because Russians are heir to a great civilization. They deserve much more than they are being permitted at present as citizens. Just two among Russia's illustrious sons are Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, whose literary genius is hard to match on a world wide scale even today. The latter fact is a pointer to the cultural and spiritual heights to which the Russian people have easily risen.

Prominent Russian pro-democracy political activist, Alexei Navalny's fate establishes beyond doubt the highly repressive nature of the Russian state. Why wasn't he allowed to engage in his political activities if what we have in Russia is a country that is tolerant of political dissent and democratic opposition? Moreover, Navalny is not the only activist to suffer repression or be 'silenced' in Russia. These factors and more place a huge question mark over the authenticity and reliability of the 'mandate' received by Putin.

To be sure, Russia ranks among the most vibrant of economies and is a force to be reckoned with in the area of science and technology. However, human freedom is as important as these assets and achievements. A people who do not enjoy fundamental freedoms and rights is as good as being enslaved. Needless to say, people, wherever they may be, must be spared this tragic condition.

However, no illusions could be entertained in any quarter about the nature of the war in Ukraine. Russia's 'special operation' in Ukraine is nothing but an invasion considering that Ukraine was a sovereign nation. If Ukraine and other regions recently annexed by Russia were 'historically Russia's' and therefore could be re-integrated into Russia on the basis of military coercion, large countries in the Asian continent, for example, would be justified in over-running some of their smaller neighbours, using the same reasoning, if in fact these smaller countries came within the physical confines of their bigger neighbours at one time. South Asia is teeming with such examples.

However, in the event of such seizures occurring in contemporary times, the world would be having on its hands compounded anarchy and world disorder. There could be a temptation on the part of some observers to point to current developments in the Gaza as smacking strongly of such disorder, but the issues in the Gaza are more complex than those in the Ukraine and defy easy bracketing of the former with the latter. The 'dynamics', to borrow a term in vogue now, of the two situations are substantially different.

There are no exemplary major powers in the West on these questions in international politics. There is the case of the US, for instance, which, over the past two decades has militarily intervened in Afghanistan and Iraq, for the sole sake of self-interest and has reduced these states to lawlessness and helplessness.

Likewise, Russia has done grave harm to the Ukraine, rather than having done it any good, through its military incursion. The human death toll and linked devastation as a result of the 'special operation' by Russia has reduced the Ukraine to a condition of indefinite Longsuffering.

The history of the Ukraine invasion speaks for itself. Two or more years into the invasion Russia is no closer to succeeding in its efforts than it was at the inception. On the other hand, Ukraine is yet to show any tangible signs of decisively beating back Russia.

What we have in the Ukraine is a military deadlock which will benefit neither warring party. But civilian blood is being unconscionably spilt on a mind-numbing scale in the Ukraine and the impartial commentator is prompted to say that both sides are losing in the war.

Given this grim backdrop it is difficult to ascertain as to how Putin and his spokesmen could claim that the military invasion 'is not a war against Ukraine', whereas Ukraine is losing in every conceivable sense. Moreover, it is difficult to figure out as to how the bloodletting in the Ukraine is boosting the popularity of Putin at home.

The impartial observer would never be in a position to assess the veracity of these claims because there is simply no way of reliably verifying them in Russia. Russians cannot be blamed for this state of affairs because not all sections in Russia could speak their minds out on these issues without running the risk of inviting state persecution.

It is a debatable matter, moreover, whether the West, which is rendering military and moral support to Ukraine, is being beaten in the latter theatre, given the continuing military deadlock. A situation of deadlock in the kind of war that is raging in the Ukraine should be viewed as a victory of sorts for Ukraine because it is managing to hold back the enemy right now, more than two years into hostilities, though at great cost. The onus is on Russia to prove the commentator wrong on this score by decisively winning in the Ukraine, but this is unlikely to materialize any time soon.

Unfortunately, a deafening silence reigns on the foregoing crucial questions in international politics among those who claim to be progressive-minded the world over. Such silence is marked among the 'progressives' of the South in particular. Whereas, it is plain to see that those claiming to be 'progressive-minded' and representative of the political Left ought to be deeply troubled over the situation of the suffering civilians in the Ukraine, this is not at all the case. The Russian political establishment seems to be having an intimidatory hold on them.

Even-handed criticism of those wielding repressive power is expected of those who act as the 'conscience of nations' in the issue areas that have just been outlined. If Western military intervention and linked atrocities in the South are wrong, the same goes for the ills that are being perpetrated in the same hemisphere by Russia and its allies.",island.lk,news,The Island,Sahan Weerasooriya,0.1529411764705881,448954308,1,http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/president-vladmir-putin.jpg,eng-9416835

This is yet another move by the AMC to address the challenges of growing Solid Waste Management (SWM) in the City. The project has been awarded to Surat-based Steamhouse India Limited. The plant to be established on a 5-acre land at the Pirana Waste dumping site, is aimed at significantly reducing environmental pollution by curbing reliance on fossil fuels, thus aligning with global trends towards waste-to-steam projects. The total cost of the project as per tender is Rs 70 crore.

Ahmedabad, being the 7th Largest Metropolis in India with a population exceeding 63 lakhs, generates approximately 4000 Metric Tons of solid waste daily. The shift towards sustainable waste management is imperative as the decomposition of organic waste in landfills emits harmful greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change, and toxic substances from various waste types pose health risks to communities.

Dr Vijay Mistry, Jt Director Mechanical at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, told Zee News English that the total cost of the project is Rs 70 crores and the AMC will pay Rs 35 crore while Steam House India will pay rest Rs 35 crore. The deadline to make the project operational is by December 2024. ""Steam House will give Rs 17.75 lakhs as royalty per month to the AMC. They will be able to recover their entire cost in 8-10 years,"" Mistry said.

The AMC Jt Director further said that the decision to steer 300 Tons Per Day (TPD) of municipal solid waste to a steam plant under the PPP model is the AMC's another step towards sustainable practices and innovative solutions in waste management. Employing Waste to Steam (WTS) technology, the project aims to adhere to stringent emission norms while promoting a circular economy through the utilization of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF). The German-proven technology, being employed for the first time in India, promises several advantages, including reduced environmental impact, minimal operational costs, and efficient resource utilization.

""Till date, we have seen that only waste to electricity was considered the waste to energy model in India.

Rosianne Cutajar was left fuming after Robert Abela ""moved the goalposts"" and publicly demanded an apology from her to be admitted back to the Labour Party.

The Prime Minister's latest condition has angered the independent MP, who was hoping to return to the PL after Abela opened the door last January.

But sources close to the Qormi MP say that after being left in the dark for more than two months, Cutajar was angered by the demand for an apology, which was never on the cards.

In comments to journalists last week, Abela said that to be readmitted into the Labour parliamentary group, Cutajar must apologise. No such condition had been made in January when Abela said Cutajar had paid her dues after being forced to resign last year.

Cutajar remained an independent MP but her possible return to the PL remains uncertain.

Sources in Cutajar's Qormi constituency said the PM's comments did not go down well and described this as ""another case of Robert Abela shifting the goalposts"".

The sources said Abela's original demands for Cutajar's return to the parliamentary group were two-fold: She writes to the party's executive explicitly asking them to be allowed back into the parliamentary group, and that she drops her defamation proceedings in court against Mark Camilleri, who published the chats on his blog.

""She did both of those things, and now out of nowhere, she is faced with another demand from his end,"" a source close to the MP who spoke to this newspaper said. ""She is fuming and rightly so.""

A minister speaking anonymously said Abela's new apology demand was never raised in any Cabinet or parliamentary group meeting.

""I and most of the parliamentary group learned of Robert Abela's demand for an apology through the media. It came as a surprise to us,"" the minister said, describing the demand as ""demeaning and patronising.""

""I mean, yes, she made a mistake, and I agree that what she did was wrong, but let's be realistic, others before her and after her have done much worse, and they only got a slap on the wrist,"" the minister said. ""He cannot continue humiliating her like this.""

Another source close to the Labour Party said the move has done little to reignite grassroot support in Cutajar's home district. ""People from outside the party will say that he absolved her for her 'sins', while people from inside the party will say that he has, once again, gone back on his word,"" the source said.

Cutajar was forced to resign from the parliamentary group in April 2023 in the wake of mounting criticism after the publication of leaked WhatsApp exchanges between Cutajar and Daphne Caruana Galizia murder suspect Yorgen Fenech from 2019.

In one exchange, Cutajar told Fenech - then not yet charged with the journalist's assassination - that she would seek a paid consultancy with the Institute for Tourism Studies to emulate 'everyone else pigging at the trough' - ostensibly a reference to others in the PL.

Cutajar had resigned as parliamentary secretary before the 2022 election pending an ethics probe over the receipt of brokerage fees from a property sale involving Fenech. She subsequently contested the election and was elected but forced to resign from the PL last year.

Her ITS job was slammed by the National Audit Office after an investigation concluded the consultancy was ""illegitimate"" and had breached regulations.",maltatoday.com.mt,news,MaltaToday.com.mt,,-0.2235294117647059,448953896,1,https://content.maltatoday.com.mt/ui_frontend/thumbnail/684/400/1.1_rosianne_cutajar.jpeg,

German firm develops projects in Taean, Sinan, IncheonBy Ko Dong-hwan

The Korea country manager of Germany's RWE Renewables, a major player in the renewable energy market which is part of RWE Group and the world's second-largest offshore wind power generator, highlighted on Monday that the company's technologies, if fully implemented in Korean waters, could produce enough clean electricity to help the country achieve its carbon neutrality goal by 2050.

In an interview with The Korea Times, RWE Renewables' Country Manager in Korea David Jones pointed out the country's globally competitive supply chain, power consumption and advanced industrial economy as its strengths.

Arriving in Korea in 2022 as the head of RWE's offshore development -- a year after the establishment of the regional office in Seoul -- the Australian national has been meticulously assessing the country's potential, exploring ways to boost partnerships and expand a pipeline of projects. His primary objective was to work together with local communities, partners, industry and supply chain to build a long-term sustainable business and offshore wind industry.

Over the past two years, RWE's offshore wind power project portfolio has expanded by over 3 gigawatts (GW) in total, exclusively in the waters off western Korea. The company anticipates the development of a new 500 megawatt (MW) farm off the coast of Taean, South Chungcheong Province, as well as another 500 MW in the waters off Sinan, South Jeolla Province. Additionally, in Incheon, RWE intends to deploy wind measurement equipment for a local 2 GW wind farm site.

During his tenure in Korea, Jones has forged new partnerships with major Korean companies, including Hyundai Engineering & Construction. RWE's corporate network in Korea further extends to LS Cable and POSCO, both of which have provided subsea cables and steel, respectively.

Due to the firm's accomplishments under his leadership and his assessment of the country's industrial, environmental, and legal conditions, Jones has concluded that RWE stands a strong chance of enhancing its energy business in Korea. He has also considered the potential contributions his company can make to the country, particularly as the Korean government aims to develop 14.3 GW of offshore wind power by 2030 and 26.7 GW by 2036. Presently, the national capacity amounts to less than 200 MW.

""Korea has strong fundamentals. It is the eighth-largest power consumer globally, the third largest per capita consumer, and is an advanced, industrial economy with export-led growth and needs to decarbonize to maintain competitiveness,"" Jones said. ""Korea also has a globally competitive and capable local supply chain supporting offshore oil and gas as well as shipbuilding. This has a great potential to support the build-out of renewable energy projects in Korea.""

Jones emphasized that RWE's involvement extends beyond merely constructing offshore wind turbines in various countries. The company also oversees their operation throughout their entire lifespan, from inception to decommissioning, often described as ""from cradle to grave."" Over the past two decades, RWE has been particularly active in the waters off the European coasts, building and operating turbines in countries such as Germany, the U.K., Sweden, and the Netherlands. Moreover, it is currently planning additional projects in countries including Denmark. Additionally, RWE has secured projects in the U.S. and Japan and is going through further auction phases as part of its expansion efforts.

Constructing turbines in waters of various countries represents only a fraction of the complexities involved in RWE's projects. In addition to building infrastructure, the company must also cultivate trust and secure consent from local communities for every new offshore wind farm. Maintaining positive relationships with these communities throughout the entire lifecycle of the project is crucial. When Jones assumed his position in Seoul, he recognized that the landscape presented not only business prospects, but also challenges, particularly from local fishery communities that may oppose turbine construction. Furthermore, the regulatory framework in Korea to support the clean energy sector remained largely incomplete at that time, presenting further hurdles for development.

However, the country head said he was undeterred by the challenges.

""We understand that our best projects will never be built without support of and working together with local communities,"" Jones said. ""There is no 'one-size-fits-all' model. We want to draw on our global experiences and work closely with local communities to find the best ways for our offshore wind farms to coexist with local stakeholders.""

To strengthen its connection with local communities, RWE Renewables Korea initiated the recruitment of local graduate talent. Last year, the company selected a Korean male intern from applicants to participate in a year-long program. This program focused on various aspects such as business site location, obtaining legal permits, and managing local stakeholders. Additionally, the intern had the opportunity to visit RWE's headquarters in Germany and inspect some of its wind farms worldwide. Upon completing the program next month, he will transition into a full-time employee of the company.

""This program shows our commitment to the Korean market to say we're here for the long term and to have a fully sustainable Korean company operating,"" Jones said. ""We'll bring on board more local graduates to the program in the future.""

Korea's legal landscape has proven to be challenging not only for RWE but also for other foreign clean energy firms seeking to invest in the country. Despite Korea's conducive natural environment for offshore wind power, European investors and developers have cited the nation's unstable energy policies and stringent regulations as significant hurdles when pursuing long-term projects. Shell, for instance, previously refuted rumors regarding its withdrawal from the Korean offshore wind market. However, the company ultimately decided last month to divest its entire 80 percent stake in a project off the coast of Ulsan.

In the midst of the turbulent environment, the emergence of the Special Bill for Offshore Wind, aimed at fostering coexistence between the offshore wind industry, fishermen, and local residents, served as a silver lining for Jones.

""The good news is that to accelerate the energy transition in Korea and achieve its ambitious offshore wind targets, the Korean government recognizes that regulatory change is required to provide better certainty for developers and address the concerns of local stakeholders,"" Jones said. ""Political parties here have been working on the special bill so that experienced and capable developers will be able to compete for the rights to develop. We believe the bill will be a win-win for all parties involved in offshore and urge the government to pass the bill as soon as possible.""

Who is David Jones?

Hailing from Perth, Australia, Jones previously served as a project director for RWE in Taiwan from 2020 to 2022. His career at the RWE Group began in 2011 in London, where he first handled commercial solutions management and then served as head of joint ventures and commercial asset management until 2017. He then moved to Essen, Germany, where he worked for the energy firm Innogy under RWE.

Alexander De Croo told the Financial Times that Belgium had taken a ""180 degree"" turn in its attitude to nuclear power, prompted in part by the bloc's laws aimed at curbing carbon emissions across Europe.

Pressure to meet those targets and a rush to move away from Russian gas has prompted renewed interest in nuclear power in Belgium and other European countries. But with Russia's enriched uranium making up 30 per cent of EU supply in 2022, there was a risk that the bloc could swap one dependency for another.

""Changing supply chains especially for nuclear is complicated but we need to do it as fast as possible . . . we need to disconnect from Russian nuclear fuel but you need to make sure you can still produce zero emission electricity,"" he said.

Belgium decided in December to extend the lifetime of two nuclear reactors that had been scheduled to be closed in 2025. They will now run until 2035 although De Croo said he personally thought their lifetime should be extended by 20 years.

The enthusiasm of the Belgian premier was echoed by leaders from more than 30 countries at the first International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear summit that took place in Brussels on Thursday.

A senior EU official said the nuclear summit was a ""reflection of a shift that is happening and it is quite remarkable"".

The renaissance of the once ostracised industry started last year at the UN's COP 28 climate summit, when 25 countries including Canada, the UK and the US signed a pledge to triple nuclear power by 2050. That marked a comeback after years in the doldrums for atomic energy plans following the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in Japan.

Han Gyu Joo, president of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, said that much of the emphasis at the Brussels summit had been on energy security, adding he'd been surprised to see it hosted by Belgium.

Seth Grae, chair of American Nuclear Society's International Council, said the difficulty of finding alternatives for Russian enriched uranium was in part due to a lack of investors. ""Enrichment capacity is a multibillion-dollar cost . . . we need guaranteed offtake from governments.""

But IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi dismissed pressure for countries to accelerate a move away from Russian fuel.

""Let's make sure this is not about using nuclear energy as a political pawn,"" Grossi told a news conference. ""I would warn against this point of good nuclear against bad nuclear, it's not conducive to what we need to have in the global energy market.""

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is EU's most Russia-friendly leader, name-checked France and Austria, who are working on Hungary's nuclear plant expansion plans piloted by Russian constructor Rosatom.

""We are happy to note that regardless of geopolitical difficulties a wide range of international, professional and scientific co-operation still exists in the field of nuclear energy,"" Orbán said.

Austria, Luxembourg and Germany have been opposed to any EU money going towards nuclear energy fearing that it will take much-needed funding from renewables, although the new government in Luxembourg has recently signalled that it may shift position.

An EU diplomat said that EU funding for nuclear power would be a ""Christmas present"" to France, home to Europe's biggest fleet of 56 reactors.

""Each nuclear project spans decades and incurs exorbitant costs, posing a risk of market distortion when EU funds are directed towards such expensive endeavours,"" Leonore Gewessler, the Austrian climate minister, told the FT.

De Croo said the summit was not a gathering of ""nuclear fanboys"".

""[It] was quite nuanced,"" he said, noting that with a history of budget overruns and a looming skills shortage ""the industry has quite some promises to deliver on"".",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,0.09019607843137245,448953672,12,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa5119d80-3b6f-4204-a4a5-ae9373e13ad6.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9416365

This was revealed by the German consultancy group VGBE Energy, which the National Treasury commissioned to recommend how Eskom can improve its performance.

The group of German engineers with extensive experience in running coal-fired power plants spent four and a half months studying South Africa's ailing power utility.

The report pointed to one issue in particular with Eskom -- its dysfunctional and overly complex management system.

This system leads to unnecessary wastage of resources meant to be directed at improving the performance of its power stations.

However, while Eskom has immense sums of money set aside for the maintenance of its plants, much of this is wasted.

This results in the utility spending more than its international peers on maintenance yet having much worse plant performance.

""Compared to international benchmarks, the maintenance budgets of Eskom's coal fleet is higher - although the Energy Availability Factor (EAF) is much lower,"" the report said.

The EAF shows the percentage of time the power station was available for use when it was needed. It is a core measure of performance for any power utility.

The engineers used maintenance budget figures from coal-fired power plants operating in Europe, the US and Asia to define an international benchmark.

From 2013 to 2027, Eskom's budgets for plant maintenance are well above the international benchmark, they said.

Thus, the money spent by Eskom should have been sufficient to execute proper maintenance and to keep the power plants in good condition.

But, the EAF of Eskom's coal fleet is currently at about 51%, whereas international benchmarks are in the range of 78%.

The report said the only way to improve the EAF is to ensure the execution of thorough operation and maintenance practices and procedures.

Eskom's complex management system and onerous procedures complicate this and prevent plant managers from addressing challenges without approval from Megawatt Park.

Eskom's EAF plummeted to 50.84%, a new record low for February towards the end of the month, despite claims from government officials that the utility had performed intensive maintenance on its plants.

The declining EAF is particularly concerning because it is the core metric for Eskom to lighten and eventually stop load-shedding.

In January 2023, then-Eskom chair Mpho Makwana said they had embarked on a turnaround journey to improve plant performance and reduce load-shedding.

Makwana set targets of 60% EAF by 31 March 2023, 65% EAF by 31 March 2024, and 70% by 31 March 2025.

These targets formed the foundation of Eskom's plan to meet the country's electricity demand and end rolling blackouts.

Unless Eskom succeeds in increasing the reliability of its generation fleet, South Africa should expect many more years of load-shedding.

The table below shows how much more money Eskom spends on maintenance compared to the international benchmark while its performance deteriorates further.

During the inspection of the power lines, an American anti-personnel mine M18A1 ""Claymore"" and a Bulgarian artillery mine HE 60MA were discovered. The detected ammunition was destroyed using controlled charges.

It was previously reported that Russian sappers had begun demining roads and buildings in the liberated town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR). The military department noted that specialists neutralize up to 400 mines daily.

It is noted that engineers are surveying and clearing the area on main roads, as well as in residential and administrative buildings, to ensure the safety of local residents and the unhindered movement of Russian troops.

Earlier, developers from Grozny created a swarm of drones for demining the area.

Russian sappers, part of the International Center for Anti-Mine Action of the Russian Armed Forces, have successfully eliminated mines on power transmission lines in the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR). This operation was necessary to protect the local population from potential harm caused by these explosive devices. However, it is important to note that these mines were discovered near electricians who were working to restore electricity to nearby settlements. This raises concerns about the safety measures taken by the LNR authorities, as they failed to ensure the protection of these workers.

During the inspection of the power lines, it was discovered that an American anti-personnel mine M18A1 ""Claymore"" and a Bulgarian artillery mine HE 60MA were planted in the area. These findings highlight the presence of foreign-made weapons in the region, which raises questions about the involvement of outside actors in the conflict. The Russian sappers promptly destroyed the detected ammunition using controlled charges, demonstrating their commitment to ensuring the safety and security of the local population.

In addition to their efforts in the LNR, Russian sappers have also been actively involved in demining operations in the town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR). These operations aim to clear roads and buildings of explosive devices, thus creating a safer environment for the local residents and facilitating the movement of Russian troops.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that developers from Grozny have recently created a swarm of drones specifically designed for demining purposes. This technological advancement showcases Russia's commitment to utilizing innovation in order to effectively address the challenges posed by explosive remnants of war.

Overall, the successful demining operations conducted by Russian sappers in the LNR and DNR demonstrate their professionalism and dedication to ensuring the safety and security of the local population. It is essential for all parties involved in the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and work towards a peaceful resolution.",dcweekly.org,news,DC Weekly,,0.1686274509803922,448952850,12,https://dcweekly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Саперы_разминировали_ЛЭП_в_ЛНР.jpeg,

The Apostle closed the previous quotation with the gracious assurance that ""whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved,"" (Acts 2:21). Calling on the name of the Lord, that is, turning away from sin and trusting Him as the only Lord and Saviour grants us pardon, remission of sin, justification and salvation.

But who is the Lord to whom we turn for salvation? Peter affirmed that He is Jesus Christ, the One they crucified, who God raised from the dead. Speaking confidently and convincingly, he reminded them of the life and ministry of Christ (Acts 2:22), the betrayal, crucifixion and death of Christ (Acts 2:23), the resurrection of Christ (Acts 2:24,32), the ascension, glorification and exaltation of Christ (Acts 2:33-36).

Peter emphasised that Christ's substitutionary death and supernatural resurrection happened by ""the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,"" (Acts 2:23). And David, the king ""being a prophet"" (Acts 2:30) saw and prophesied that God ""would raise up Christ.""

In conclusion, he laid the guilt of their sin before them. ""Ye crucified"" ""Christ, the Lord of glory,"" (Acts 2:36; 1Corinthians 2:8).So irresistible was the convicting power of the Holy Ghost that there was an immediate response. The people that heard Peter, cried out, ""what shall we do"" to be free from guilt and to escape everlasting condemnation and eternal punishment? The answer rings loud and clear throughout the whole Bible: Repent (Ezekiel 14:6;18:30; Matthew 4:17; Mark 1:14,15; Luke 13:3,5; 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 17:30,31; 20:20,21; 26:20; Revelation 2:5,16; 3:3,19).

True repentance is known by the accompanying fruits - ""save yourselves from this untoward (perverse, crooked, sinful) generation,"" (Acts 2:40). The truly repentant people were to separate themselves from all the sinful practices and lifestyle of their society.

After repentance and faith in Christ and accepting Jesus as their Saviour, the people were to be baptised in water (Mark 16:15,16). Water baptism does not save, neither does it wash away sin. Only the blood of Jesus washes away sin and only Jesus saves when we repent and believe on Him. But by water baptism, the new believers declared their separation from the nation that crucified Christ and proclaimed their identification with the risen Lord.

Submitting to Christ in obedience and continuing steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine, many precious promises will be theirs, including ""the gift of the Holy Ghost.""

Peter Uzoho and Oluchi Chibuzor

The federal government has charged all the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country to be ready to receive and distribute not less than 6,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the next six months.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, who stated this, also announced the government's plan to secure funding ranging from N250 billion to N300 billion to close the over seven million metering gap in the country on an annual basis over the next four to five years.

He explained that the government intended to raise that fund through a N75-billion seed capital to be provided by President Bola Tinubu's administration, along with additional debt capital injections from the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

Adelabu revealed these at the weekend when he visited Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) in Lagos and the Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited (MEMMCOL) in Ogun State.

He revealed that a bill for legislation to replicate local content law in the power sector was underway.

Speaking at the Eko Disco office, Adelabu said the charge to the Discos to be prepared to uptake 6,100MW became necessary after the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) successfully conducted system stress tests, where it demonstrated its ability to transmit over 8,100MW, alongside the proposed plans for a partial Sovereign Risk Guarantee (SRG) to enhance generation companies' (Gencos) capacity.

With Eko and Ikeja Discos having exceeded a specified threshold through improved collection efficiency and service quality, Adelabu said he had unveiled a strategic plan to utilise the two Discos as model Discos to pilot test the anticipated effective supply to be implemented sector-wide in the next few months.

He said the two Discos would serve as a standard for emulation by others.

However, at the MEMMCOL meter plant in Ogun, Adelabu also stated that in line with President Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, the government was targeting to provide about 2.5 million prepaid meters every year to close the nation's metering gap.

This, he said, would help the government in the promotion of import substitution policy of locally-made products in the power sector and encourage backward integration in the areas of technical training.

He equally expressed the current administration's commitment to support local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by working on a bill that would promote local content for the power sector.

""We have a Presidential Metering Initiative that has the target of installing a minimum of two million to 2.5 million meters every year for the next five years, for us to close the huge metering gap that we currently have in the power sector.

""Even if we cannot close it 100 per cent as there will be new connections, we have to reduce it significantly and the government cannot do it alone. We have to do it jointly with all parties because we all contributed to the decay in the sector and we must also contribute to reversing the decay"", the minister stated.

He maintained that the initiatives would encourage investors to risk their equity and debt capital to establish local industries.

""In the power sector, it is our choice to have significant local content in our projects and our contracts. We are trying to work on a bill now that will legislate local content for the power sector just like we have in our oil and gas. That is the only way we can sustain local producers. So, that is the reason I am here.""

In his earlier briefings to the minister, the Chairman of MEMMCOL, Mr. Kola Balogun, thanked Adelabu for the courage and commitment he had shown so far to reverse the ugly trends in the power sector

Balogun, however, noted that the demand for prepaid meters in Nigeria surpasses the volume of other countries in Africa, noting that local patronage was still needed for them to meet the investment threshold.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.09019607843137245,448951864,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/power-sector.jpeg,

Launch of new models by automakers is also helping attract new buyers into this segment. This year's sales performance would mark a 67% jump from the 60,910 electric PVs sold in FY23.

iElectric vehicles (EVs) are set to scale a new milestone, breaching the 100,000 sales mark this financial year (FY24), fuelling the government's ambitious aim of electrifying up to 30% of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030.

The sales surge would be propelled by falling battery prices and resultant product price cuts by some automakers, robust government support for eco-friendly vehicles, higher prices of fossil fuels and growing environmental awareness among consumers. Launch of new models by automakers is also helping attract new buyers into this segment. This year's sales performance would mark a 67% jump from the 60,910 electric PVs sold in FY23.

In the electric two-wheeler segment too, sales are expected to climb 25% to an all-time high of more than 758,000 units this fiscal, according to market research firm Jato Dynamics.

Despite the robust sales, EV penetration in India remains low due to consumer concerns over affordability, range anxiety and inadequate charging infrastructure.

EVs currently comprise about 2.3% of all passenger vehicles sold in the country. In two-wheelers, the electric share is 4.8% of the domestic market.

Carmakers are raising their bets by launching more electric mass models. Tata Motors dominates the EV market with its Tiago, Nexon, Tigor and Punch models, followed by MG Motor India, and Mahindra & Mahindra. China's BYD, a relatively new entrant, is also making strong inroads, surging ahead of even established rivals such as South Korea's Hyundai and Kia.

Tata Motors, with a more than 70% share of the EV market, plans to expand its portfolio in this category by rolling out the Harrier EV and Curvv EV models over the next few months.

The automaker, India's third-largest, has lofty electric ambitions. EVs already account for 14-15% of the company's sales, which it aims to increase to 25% by 2027 and 50% by the end of the decade.

EVs continue to make up a major share of MG Motor India's overall vehicle sales, accounting for about 33% of total units sold in February. Gaurav Gupta, deputy managing director at MG Motor India, said, ""Around 30% of our total sales come from our EV models, as the company is continuing to enhance its product portfolio.""

MG is one of the first automakers to launch EVs in India, starting with the ZS model, and the Comet launched last year.

China's SAIC Motor Corp-owned MG Motor India and JSW also kickstarted a joint venture that will produce both electric and internal combustion engine cars with the aim of capturing a large chunk of the Indian market.

In the two-wheeler segment, Ola Electric leads the pack with the highest sales and market share, followed by TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto, and Ather Energy.

While EVs have a higher upfront cost, their lower fuel and maintenance expenses, coupled with government incentives, make them relatively more cost-competitive compared with petrol and diesel vehicles in the long run, especially for high-mileage drivers, CareEdge Ratings said in its latest report.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.2313725490196079,448951822,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108743925,imgsize-92220,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/industry/indians-electric-love-to-power-ev-sales-to-a-record.jpg",eng-9418000

Lights at public places and prominent sites in various cities of India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were turned off between 8.30 pm to 9.30 pm last night as part of the global 'Earth Hour' event. The annual event is observed to raise awareness about energy conservation.

Lights at India Gate and the famous Akshardham temple in the National Capital were turned off for an hour. According to power distribution company BSES, 206 MW of electricity was saved on account of the Earth Hour in Delhi as a whole.

At Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, lights were switched off for an hour to mark Earth Hour. In Kolkata, too, the lights of the iconic Howrah Bridge were turned off to mark the annual event observed globally to promote awareness about climate change. The lights of the Dr BR Ambedkar Telangana State Secretariat were switched off, and candles were lit in the shape of the number '60' symbolising 60 minutes of an hour at the state secretariat during this time.

Raj Bhavan in Hyderabad also joined the nationwide Earth Hour initiative by turning off all lights in its iconic premises, staff colony, officer's quarters, and administrative building for one hour. In Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) also observed Earth Hour at the Napier Museum by lighting candles. The lights at the Assam Legislative Assembly in Guwahati were also turned off to conserve energy.

Through Earth Hour, WWF encourages people worldwide to turn their lights off for 60 minutes to raise awareness about environmental issues. Started in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour is an annual international event, that has been held since 2007 on the last Saturday in March by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

Peter Uzoho and Oluchi Chibuzor

The federal government has charged all the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country to be ready to receive and distribute not less than 6,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the next six months.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, who stated this, also announced the government's plan to secure funding ranging from N250 billion to N300 billion to close the over seven million metering gap in the country on an annual basis over the next four to five years.

He explained that the government intended to raise that fund through a N75-billion seed capital to be provided by President Bola Tinubu's administration, along with additional debt capital injections from the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

Adelabu revealed these at the weekend when he visited Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) in Lagos and the Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited (MEMMCOL) in Ogun State.

He revealed that a bill for legislation to replicate local content law in the power sector was underway.

Speaking at the Eko Disco office, Adelabu said the charge to the Discos to be prepared to uptake 6,100MW became necessary after the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) successfully conducted system stress tests, where it demonstrated its ability to transmit over 8,100MW, alongside the proposed plans for a partial Sovereign Risk Guarantee (SRG) to enhance generation companies' (Gencos) capacity.

With Eko and Ikeja Discos having exceeded a specified threshold through improved collection efficiency and service quality, Adelabu said he had unveiled a strategic plan to utilise the two Discos as model Discos to pilot test the anticipated effective supply to be implemented sector-wide in the next few months.

He said the two Discos would serve as a standard for emulation by others.

However, at the MEMMCOL meter plant in Ogun, Adelabu also stated that in line with President Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, the government was targeting to provide about 2.5 million prepaid meters every year to close the nation's metering gap.

This, he said, would help the government in the promotion of import substitution policy of locally-made products in the power sector and encourage backward integration in the areas of technical training.

He equally expressed the current administration's commitment to support local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by working on a bill that would promote local content for the power sector.

""We have a Presidential Metering Initiative that has the target of installing a minimum of two million to 2.5 million meters every year for the next five years, for us to close the huge metering gap that we currently have in the power sector.

""Even if we cannot close it 100 per cent as there will be new connections, we have to reduce it significantly and the government cannot do it alone. We have to do it jointly with all parties because we all contributed to the decay in the sector and we must also contribute to reversing the decay"", the minister stated.

He maintained that the initiatives would encourage investors to risk their equity and debt capital to establish local industries.

""In the power sector, it is our choice to have significant local content in our projects and our contracts. We are trying to work on a bill now that will legislate local content for the power sector just like we have in our oil and gas. That is the only way we can sustain local producers. So, that is the reason I am here.""

In his earlier briefings to the minister, the Chairman of MEMMCOL, Mr. Kola Balogun, thanked Adelabu for the courage and commitment he had shown so far to reverse the ugly trends in the power sector

Balogun, however, noted that the demand for prepaid meters in Nigeria surpasses the volume of other countries in Africa, noting that local patronage was still needed for them to meet the investment threshold.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.04313725490196085,448951645,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/power-sector.jpeg,eng-9420303

Under these stable conditions, localized areas on the Big Island could experience Wind Advisory conditions with gusts as high as 50 mph.

Rainfall has been modest and confined to windward slopes this afternoon, and the best chances for showers will be on windward Big Island and Kauai into tonight.

An upper-level trough runs southward over the Big Island and is supporting a 500 mb low a couple hundred miles to the south.

Easterly winds on the flank of the 500 mb low have not been as strong as expected today, but a Wind Advisory remains posted for the high Summits of the Big Island, where stronger winds should fill in tonight.

Trade winds will ease to moderate strength Sunday night and Monday as the high to the northeast weakens.

The mid- to upper- level low will weaken and drift a little closer to the islands.

The latest guidance suggests that the main impact will be mid to high clouds over much of the state, with just enough low-level ridging to maintain some stability.

For now, it appears that there will not be a significant increase in shower activity, but it will need to be monitored.

The shift in the position and intensity of the low aloft will cause winds at the high summits to shift out of the south and likely ease.

A return to breezy and gusty trade winds will occur Wednesday into at least Friday as another strong surface high sets up north of the state.

There is no clear signal for any enhancement to rainfall. Thus, the forecast favors a typical pattern of mainly windward showers.

The five landmark locations also took part last night. They were the Grand Palace, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, or Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, Wat Saket and the Rama 8 Bridge.

And prior to that, it could show off its streaks across the sky.

The devil comet, officially called 12P/Pons-Brooks, will treat the skygazers this month by showing off its streaks across the night sky.

One can see this celestial nomad with a decent pair of binoculars or a telescope. Nevertheless, by the end of March, its brightness will reportedly increase to fifth magnitude, making it bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.

On April 8, 12P/Pons-Brooks might even show up during the total solar eclipse. During the day, 12P/Pons-Brooks would normally be much too faint to view, but if the eclipse makes the Sun darker, there is a chance the comet will emerge from the darkness.

If it occurs, it will appear roughly the width of two fists held at arm's length or about 25 degrees away from the Sun. The exact location on the clock face in relation to the Sun will primarily rely on your point of view when viewing it from Earth.

At most, the comet will resemble a tiny speck in the sky. The total eclipse will be sublime; it will peak in southwest Texas and endure no longer than four and a half minutes or less from certain other spots along its path.

After that, on April 21, it will vanish into the dusk light of April and arrive at the perihelion, or the point closest to the Sun. People in the Southern Hemisphere will be able to see it as it starts to wane.

The upcoming solar eclipse will be the best in centuries for several reasons. First, it's the longest since 1806. The total eclipse could last for 4 minutes and 28 seconds in Mexico.

The last totality of this length occurred in North America on June 16, 1806, when a total solar eclipse lasted 4 minutes and 55 seconds and passed over Boston, Baja California, Kansas City, and Albuquerque on its route to Cape Cod.

Also, it will be a solar maximum. The Sun's corona will look wider and more symmetrical during solar maximum, more like a sunflower than a thorny patch. Because of the Sun's magnetic activity, it is anticipated that the Sun will reach solar maximum later this year.

The upcoming eclipse will also be the darkest in 217 years. The level of darkness depends on the solar eclipse's magnitude. On April 8, when the magnitude is 1.05, and the line of totality is around 115 miles wide, Jupiter and Venus will be visible.

Several cities will witness the total solar eclipse. Among the important cities along the route of totality are Mazatlán and Torreón in Mexico; Dallas-Forth Worth-Arlington, Austin, and (portions of) San Antonio in Texas; Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, and Hamilton; and Niagara, St. Catharines, Kingston, and Montreal in Canada. This means that approximately 10 million people will have the opportunity to see the anticipated total solar eclipse.",sciencetimes.com,news,Science Times,Caleb White,-0.02745098039215688,448951310,1,https://1721181113.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/52729/820/0/0/0/devil-comet-might-appear-during-the-anticipated-total-solar-eclipse.jpeg,eng-9413446

The Bishop's Stortford Cemetery Act became law on Wednesday, March 20.

It gives the town council powers to ""lift and deepen"" graves in its Old Cemetery and New Cemetery if those plots are at least 75 years old. This involves digging up the remains in an existing grave, digging that grave to a greater depth, and then re-interring the remains, sometimes in a new coffin. The rest of the grave could be used for fresh burials.

The new law also gives Bishop's Stortford Town Council the power to extinguish people's right of burial, if a person has not exercised that right for at least 75 years.

London borough councils already have similar powers, through the London Local Authorities Act 2007. Special laws similar to the Bishop's Stortford Cemetery Act also apply at the private Highgate Cemetery in Camden, the resting place of Karl Marx and Wham! star George Michael, and New Southgate Cemetery in Barnet.

Town council chiefs feared Bishop's Stortford would run out of cemetery space by the mid-2030s without new powers. ""It is vital that the shortage of cemetery land is addressed as soon as possible, so that people continue to have access to local, affordable burials, and that cemeteries remain sustainable,"" said Julie Dunk, chief executive of the National Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management (ICCM).

""We're really pleased that the Bishop's Stortford Cemetery Act has now been passed and that the people of Bishop's Stortford will be able to be buried locally into the future. Hopefully, this will be a spur to the government to answer the calls that the ICCM has been making for over 20 years, to pass legislation to enable reuse of old, abandoned graves.""

Bishop's Stortford Town Council staff must tell the owners of a right of burial if they plan to extinguish it. They must also place a notice close to the grave, online and in a newspaper six months before disturbing human remains or removing a right of burial.

A relative can object to the plans once they are declared, which puts a 25-year hold on the authority taking any action. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which looks after the graves of people who died in the two world wars, can also object to the reuse of graves.

A Bishop's Stortford Town Council spokesperson told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): ""If people come and object in line with the law, that's not a problem to us. We are pleased that this solves a problem in perpetuity.""

The authority has adopted a grave reuse protocol on top of the Bishop's Stortford Cemetery Act. It sets out graves will not be reused if there is a ""clearly defined but damaged coffin with significant skeletal remains found"".

If gravediggers find a fully intact coffin or remains that are not fully decomposed, the authority will also backfill the grave without reusing it. ""All remains that are disturbed will be reburied in the same grave in which they are found,"" the protocol adds.

An LDRS probe in 2023 found seven councils in Hertfordshire with 11 cemeteries between them had graveyard land supply which could be exhausted within two decades - including Bishop's Stortford Town Council. Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council is set to run out of space at The Lawn, Hatfield by approximately 2028. The authority has earmarked land to expand the Hatfield cemetery in its 2016-2036 housing masterplan.

Hertsmere Borough Council has approximately one year before Allum Lane cemetery in Elstree is full. The authority ran a survey on cemetery expansion which closed on Monday, February 5.

A 167-year-old law prevents public authorities from disturbing graves without special permissions - the Burial Act 1857. The Law Commission, which looks at how laws could be modernised, is studying law of burial in England and Wales.

""Burial space is running out across England and Wales, with the situation worse in some urban areas,"" the commission's website reads. ""Grave reuse has been proposed as a solution to this problem, but reform to permit the reuse of graves must include sufficient safeguards to maintain public support.""

Viscount Stansgate, a Labour peer, was one of the Bill Committee members who looked at the Bishop's Stortford Cemetery Act in draft form. He told the House of Lords in September: ""This is a bill about cemeteries and running out of space. I think you will find in years to come, my Lords, that more and more cemeteries will be in this position, so we may have further bills of this kind.""",essexlive.news,news,Essex Live,Will Durrant,-0.1294117647058823,448951159,1,https://i2-prod.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/incoming/article9181272.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chorleywood-Lawn-Cemetery-Credit-Will-Durrant-LDRSJPG.jpg,

Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under USD 130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a USD 20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.08235294117647052,448950991,12,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108743775,imgsize-252348,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/industry/coal-the-dirtiest-fossil-fuel-is-preparing-for-a-long-goodbye.jpg",

According to Armenia's claim, the station, which was last operational until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, and after that time only the second block was operated, supposedly provides 40 percent of the country's energy needs. However, the fact that the station's other block is completely unusable and the obsolete equipment does not meet the standards is becoming a source of a big bang for the region.

In late 2020, the Armenian government announced that the Metsamor NPP would close for five months in 2021 to attempt significant upgrades. Soon after, the EU urged Armenia to make the closure permanent since the plant ""cannot be updated to fully meet internationally accepted safety standards."" Because a major nuclear or radiation accident at Metsamor would not only affect the people of Armenia, but citizens in neighboring Turkiye, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, and southern Europe.

According to Pakistani political analyst Imran Khalid, who commented on the issue when speaking to Azernews, Metsamor NPP on the surface aims to reduce Armenia's energy dependence, but in reality to raise the country's 'reputation' in the nuclear field.

""By maintaining a robust nuclear energy sector Armenia wants to enhance its standing and influence within the region. Besides, as to Armenian authorities, by demonstrating its commitment to sustainable energy development and technological advancement, the country can strengthen diplomatic ties and cooperation with neighboring countries and international partners,"" he said.

However, although Armenia aims to move forward, it still puts neighboring countries and even a part of the European continent at deadliest risk due to its personal ambitions.

In fact, Armenia can meet its energy needs even without Metsamor NPP. Because almost half of the energy obtained from the station is exported to Iran. On the other hand, since Armenia imports natural gas from Russia, the need for nuclear energy is decreasing, which means that Metsamor cannot be the only source of energy in reaching the desired goal of Armenia. On the contrary, the station, which fell into disrepair, turned into a real deadly bomb.

The expert added that Armenia's desire for nuclear energy stems from its desire to compete with Azerbaijan as well as from the desire to compare itself to nuclear producers such as Iran and South Korea.

""By renovating Metsamor and simultaneously initiating another nuclear plant (with the help of Rosatom), Armenia intends to ensure its continuation of its expertise in nuclear technology as a bargaining chip vis a vis Azerbaijan because there has been many examples where countries are suspected of diverting their nuclear programs into weapon grade for example Iran and North Korea,"" Khalid added.

The Pakistani expert also said that against the backdrop of Europe and the West's serious competition with Moscow in the region, the issue of completely suspending this station, which is becoming a threat, is out of the agenda. According to him, the Metsamor nuclear power plant has faced safety concerns due to its aging infrastructure and seismic activity in the region.

In a statement, the foundation said it welcomed a government move to contribute to the costs of expanding the terminal at the port of Cuxhaven, on the North Sea coast.

The government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal, together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), a government spokesperson said on Saturday.

""The expansion of the Cuxhaven port is a central project for the expansion of renewable energies,"" said Stefan Wenzel, parliamentary state secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

In a letter of intent signed in November 2022, Egypt said it would allow most fuel product prices to rise to bring domestic prices more in line with those in international energy markets. It also promised to make up for a slowdown in such increases over the previous year. But it subsequently hiked prices only once, in March 2023.

The IMF agreement fell into abeyance last year after Egypt did not follow through on price rises and other commitments, including allowing its currency to move according to market forces, quickly selling state assets and reducing the government's role in the economy.

The IMF this month expanded the financial support agreement to $8 billion to help Egypt overcome shocks to its economy caused by war in Gaza and after the government renewed its commitment to the reform measures, including a sharp devaluation of the currency.

The IMF board has not yet met to approve the new agreement.

The official gazette, citing the petroleum ministry, said a quarterly pricing committee raised petrol prices on Friday by 1.00 Egyptian pound ($0.02) per litre, with 80 octane rising to 11.00 pounds, 92 octane to 12.50 pounds and 95 octane to 13.50 pounds.

And doughnuts that capture the sun's disappearing act with the help of buttercream frosting.

With April 8's total solar eclipse right around the corner, businesses are ready for the celestial event that will dim skies along a generous path across North America.

There are oodles of special eclipse safety glasses for sale, along with T-shirts emblazoned with clever slogans and other souvenirs -- just like the last time the U.S. got a big piece of the total solar eclipse action in 2017.

Hotels and resorts along the prime path are luring in visitors with special packages and Southwest and Delta are selling seats on eclipse-viewing flights. Cities, museums and parks are staging watch parties to draw in tourists as well as residents.

""This is a special event and ... the travel industry certainly is in a very good spot,"" said Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland's business school. She also noted the eclipse craze arrives at a time when consumers are continuing to ramp up spending on new experiences.

Closer to eclipse day, there are likely to be more special products and promotions from national brands springing up, like Moon Pie's ""eclipse survival kit,"" made up of four mini versions of the chocolate snack and two pairs of eclipse glasses.

Small businesses within the eclipse's 115-mile-wide path of totality appear to be leading the charge so far. Online shops and local vendors have put together a full array of creative, limited-edition merchandise: earrings, baby onesies, ornaments, games, banners and more.

Some towns and business owners have been anticipating the celestial event and huge crowds for years.

After the 2017 eclipse, ""I marked my calendar,"" said Sam McNulty, co-founder of Market Garden Brewery in Cleveland, which is in the eclipse path this time and will see nearly four minutes of dimmed skies.

Last year, McNulty's team brewed a hazy IPA called ""The Totality"" to help drum up interest in the eclipse. The on tap debut was a success, and the brewery was soon approached by local grocer Heinen's to partner for a canned collaboration.

In the coming weeks, ""thousands and thousands"" of cans are set to hit store shelves, McNulty said -- adding they decided to go big because of how rare the event is. Cleveland won't be in the path of totality again for a long time -- not until 2444.

""I don't want to have to wait 420 years to brew the next batch of cans,"" he joked. ""So we made a very large one this time.""

The eclipse-themed beverages don't stop at beer. Big Cuppa, a coffee shop in Morrilton, Arkansas, also has a full eclipse menu with a handful of specialty drinks. Its ""Moon Pie Frappa"" is a blended Moon Pie drink flavored with dark chocolate and toasted marshmallow.

Big Cuppa co-owner Joseph Adam Krutz said that he's excited to greet customers and the many new faces set to travel through town next month. Krutz said his shop has been gearing up for a while along with other businesses in downtown Morrilton. He drives by a countdown clock each day.

""We're prepared. Bring it on,"" Krutz said.

And don't forget the snacks. In Ohio's Butler County, a shop called The Donut Dude will have an ""Eclipse Donut Special"" that shows the eclipse's stages as the sun disappears behind the moon.

The special goes on sale later this month and consists of seven filled-doughnuts with rolled buttercream, two galaxy-themed cake doughnuts and safety glasses so customers can watch the event while snacking away.

""We're anticipating a lot of fun,"" co-owner Glen Huey said.

Since the doughnut shop is closed on Mondays, Huey is looking forward to watching the spectacle as it passes over his town between Cincinnati and Dayton.

In the U.S., Texas has the best odds for clear skies and the state expects to be swarmed with tourists. With a prime location, eateries in the town of Grapevine have a multitude of offerings: a ""Blackout Dinner"" at Hotel Vin and a ""Solar Eclipse Shake"" at Son of a Butcher.

Many businesses along the path of totality are offering special events leading up to the eclipse, too.

New York's Cayuga Lake Wine Trail is promoting ""Sips to the Eclipse"" for the weekend ahead of April 8. Guests will be able to visit 10 wineries for tastings -- some of which are offering additional attractions like an eclipse eve tarot card reading, special slushies and half-moon cookies.

Speaking at China's flagship international business conference in Beijing, Georgieva said the global economy showed remarkable resilience to shocks but was headed for growth that was ""weak by historical standards"" in the medium term as low productivity growth and high debt levels curbed progress.

""China faces a fork in the road -- rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" Georgieva told the China Development Forum in Beijing, according to a copy of her speech.

Li promised that Beijing would prepare regulations to smooth market access for foreign enterprises and efforts to boost domestic consumption.

The conference comes as China's trading partners confront oversupply risks in major industries including electric vehicles and steel, which could spur manufacturers to dump excess goods on global markets.

Beijing has set a growth target of 5 per cent for this year, the same as in 2023 but low compared to previous years, and analysts expect the economy to slow further in the medium term on the back of a property downturn and demographic decline.

China has responded by promising to invest more in manufacturing and infrastructure but economists are calling for it to do more to stimulate domestic demand.

Georgieva's use of the term ""high-quality growth"" borrows from the rhetoric of China's President Xi Jinping, who has urged Chinese industry to move up the value chain into more sophisticated technology and value-added industries.

She said with a ""comprehensive package of pro-market reforms"" China could add 20 per cent or $3.5tn to its economy over the next 15 years.

These would include reducing the stock of unfinished housing left over from its real estate crisis and ""giving more space for market based corrections in the property sector"".

Strengthening China's pension system in a ""fiscally responsible way"" could help boost the spending power of individuals and families, she said, while reforms to ensure a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises could improve the allocation of capital.

""Investments in human capital -- in education, life-long training and reskilling -- and quality healthcare will deliver higher labour productivity and higher incomes,"" she said.

On the global economy, she said ""strong macroeconomic fundamentals"" in most of the advanced and emerging countries had helped weather the shocks of the past years.

But she said 2024 would be challenging for fiscal authorities in most countries. ""They need to embrace consolidation to reduce debt and rebuild buffers, and at the same time finance the digital and green transformations of their economies,"" she said.",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,0.1137254901960785,448949321,1,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F79bf109b-5045-40f3-aae4-39609293669d.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9421105

According to the Philippine military, the confrontation lasted for nearly an hour and took place as it sought to resupply a small garrison of sailors on board the sunken Sierra Madre off Second Thomas Shoal.

The Philippines military has shared a video showing a white ship marked Chinese Coast Guard crossing the bow of a grey vessel, which it identified as the Philippine supply boat Unaizah May 4.

In a post on X, Armed Forces of the Philippines stated, ""The BRP Cabra managed to maneuver and reach Unaizah May 4 to provide assistance to the Philippine supply boat, which had sustained significant damage,"" Al Jazeera reported.

In a statement, the Philippines military said, ""The UM4 supply boat sustained heavy damages at around 08:52 (00:52 GMT) due to the continued blasting of water cannons from the CCG vessels.""

Meanwhile, Chinese Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu claimed that the Philippine convoy ""forcibly intruded into the area despite repeated warnings issued by China. It further said that China conducted ""control, obstruction and eviction in accordance with law,"" Al Jazeera reported.

It is the latest incident between China and the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea. China continues to claim almost the entire South China Sea, despite an international court finding in 2016 that the nine-dash line on which it bases its claim was without merit. Meanwhile, Philippines claims areas of the sea around its coasts like Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia. Taiwan has also claimed areas of the sea.

The Philippines has expanded its military ties with the US. The United States has no claims to the strategic waters. However, it has sent Navy ships on transit missions through the waterway in what it says ""freedom of navigation"" operations. China has criticised the US action in the waters.

In the pursuit of a sustainable future, the global movement to reduce carbon emissions has gained momentum, driving nations to explore alternative energy sources beyond traditional fossil fuels, and addressing the world's energy storage challenges. India stands at a crossroads, contemplating a shift towards batteries, hydrogen, CNG, and biofuels to pave the way for a cleaner, greener future.

India's electric vehicle segment achieved a historic milestone in 2023, surpassing 1.5-million-unit sales with an impressive 50% year-on-year growth. Despite policy initiatives and incentives like Auto Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and FAME II, EV penetration remains relatively low, accounting for only around 1% of total sales. There is still a need to address challenges such as range anxiety, high prices, and inadequate charging infrastructure to accelerate the growth of electric mobility in India. As the government and industry players collaborate on technological advancements, the dream of widespread e-mobility inches closer to reality.

The country has also emerged as a major player in biofuel production and consumption, with the potential to triple both consumption and production in the next five years. Coordinated policies, political support, and abundant feedstocks have positioned India to lead the way in biofuel deployment. The launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance in 2023, with India at the forefront, presents an opportunity to further boost global biofuel deployment. With a projected 30% increase in biofuel demand over the next five years, India's commitment to sustainable biofuels aligns with the global push towards cleaner alternatives, making significant strides in the race to reduce carbon footprints.

Moreover, the evolution of the passenger vehicle segment in India, particularly in the Rs 5-15 lakh price bracket, has witnessed a shift towards compressed natural gas (CNG) as a preferred fuel option. The introduction of BS-VI emission standards in April 2020 marked a turning point, leading to a surge in CNG vehicle sales. Data from JATO Dynamics reveals a remarkable increase in CNG sales, growing from 161,378 units in FY21 to 421,420 units in FY23. With CNG penetration rising from 6.59% in FY21 to 11.03% in FY23, it's evident that CNG is emerging as a significant contributor to India's clean energy transition.

As India accelerates its transition towards cleaner transportation, the localization of fuel cells for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Hybrid Vehicles becomes a pivotal focus. This move not only drives technological advancements but also supports the government's goal of reducing dependence on traditional fuels.

India's rapid economic development and soaring population contribute to a growing energy demand, with the road transport sector heavily reliant on petroleum oil. The import of over four-fifths of crude petroleum places a substantial burden on the country's import bill. In a bid to decarbonize the road transport sector and address energy security and air quality concerns, India explores alternative fuels such as biofuels, compressed natural gas, methanol, electricity, and hydrogen. These alternatives not only contribute to reducing global CO2 emissions but also offer significant opportunities for the nation's economic growth by 2030, diminishing reliance on crude-producing nations.

India stands at the forefront of a transformative energy revolution. Integrating batteries, hydrogen, CNG, and biofuels into the nation's energy landscape signifies a resolute commitment to sustainable mobility and a renewable energy future. As hydrogen emerges as a pivotal player in clean energy, the nation anticipates a shift towards zero-emission solutions, contributing significantly to a sustainable and eco-friendly future. The remarkable growth of CNG in India's passenger vehicle segment propels the nation closer to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious mode of transportation.

The surge in investments and production of biofuels positions India as a key player in the global biofuel landscape. The establishment of the Global Biofuels Alliance, under India's helm, further contributes to a cleaner and greener planet.

In the broader context, collective national commitment extends beyond corporate endeavours, building a resilient, eco-friendly, and economically robust future. India envisions a future where batteries, hydrogen, CNG, and biofuels converge to redefine the energy landscape, not only addressing immediate environmental challenges but propelling the nation to global leadership in sustainable energy practices. As the nation embarks on this promising trajectory, the fusion of technological innovation and collective commitment promises a future where energy becomes a powerful catalyst for positive change, answering the call to ditch fossil fuels and embrace a cleaner, greener tomorrow.

Or follow us on Google News!

The idea of floating solar panels on reservoirs and other calm waters has already taken hold. Sending them off to sea is another matter of next-level engineering. However, the potential benefit of co-locating solar arrays with offshore wind farms is a tempting prize, and the firm Moss Maritime is moving closer to a solution.

The Moss venture is especially interesting because Moss Maritime is an established expert in floating offshore technology as a branch of the global conglomerate Saipem, which is known for its decades-long experience in offshore oil drilling. It's a good example of the ways in which fossil energy know-how can work for the energy transition, not against it.

This particular development has been a long time coming. Sometime between 2018 and 2019, Saipem and Equinor agreed to develop a modular offshore floating solar platform based on a concept developed by Moss, with a focus on ease of manufacture, transportation, and installation. In addition, the modular design was aimed at maximizing flexibility in rough offshore waters, to prevent waves from swamping the solar panels.

The initial timeline called for planning, modeling, and testing at the Norwegian maritime industries research institution SINTEF Ocean, with a 1-megawatt pilot installation to follow in 2020.

Somewhere along the way there was a hitch, and the timeline was adjusted to install a 0.5-megawatt version in 2023. SINTEF issued a recap of the project back in June of 2021, in which it indicated why the adjustment was needed.

The testing regimen was described as ""revolutionary"" for SINTEFF. To date, much of the available work on floating solar has been conducted on testing platforms designed for reservoirs and inland lakes, where waters are generally calm.

""We've never before tested a design involving so many modules. However, the development of water-based installations is not without challenges,"" SINTEFF Senior Research Scientist Nuno Fonseca explained, referring to the 64-module platform used in the modeling phase of the program.

""Infrastructure needs to be designed to withstand dynamic stresses caused by waves, wind and currents, and at the same time generate energy that competes with other energy sources on price,"" Fonseca added.

When SINTEF issued its recap, the modeling and testing part of the program demonstrated the feasibility of deploying offshore floating solar arrays ""far out at sea,"" potentially opening the door to co-locating them with offshore wind farms.

The next big step came just last week, when Moss Maritime reported that the Norwegian global risk management leader DNV greenlighted its XolarSurf concept for offshore floating solar.

""The recognition not only validates the design methodology but also paves the way for further innovations in floating solar, offering opportunities for clean energy generation close to shore without land use,"" Moss explained in a press statement.

In an interesting twist, DNV's decision is based on standards adopted for the offshore floating wind turbine field. The firm issued a ""Statement of Conformity"" for Moss's XolarSurf concept based on Standard DNV-ST-0119, which sets minimum, internationally recognized requirements for floating wind structures.

With the seal of approval from DNV in hand, Moss anticipates floating a prototype version of XolarSurf in the water by June.

No word yet on when the company plans to attach XolarSurf to an offshore wind farm, but if and when it goes into commercial production, the implications for the offshore renewable energy field are huge.

Offshore wind developers have been looking for economical opportunities to defray their costs by co-locating floating solar panels, wave energy converters, and seaweed farms or other aquaculture ventures.

Moss sees especially rich opportunities for solar co-location. ""In fact, by combining floating solar with offshore wind farms and thereby leveraging the same energy infrastructure and export cables, the resulting energy production capacity per used area could be drastically improved,"" the company explains.

""This greatly underscores the viability of floating solar PV as a key component of the renewable energy landscape and its relevance in the energy transition,"" Moss adds.

In addition to co-locating the XolarSurf at fixed-platform wind farms, Minge Thøgersen, Moss's VP of Engineering, seems to expect XolarSurf to could compete directly with floating wind technology.

""Compared to floating wind turbines, floating solar power technology is simpler, engineering costs are lower, and structures are easier to build. Floating solar power is also well suited for mass production, which will have a positive impact on price and deployment,"" he observes.

Apparently DNV is expecting further refinements from Moss, based on the requirements outlined by Standard DNV-ST-0119.

""In practice, Moss Maritime has received an instruction manual, so that they can design and develop floating solar power that can withstand rough sea conditions,"" Hans Kristian Danielsen of DNV explained in a press statement.

In the meantime, activity is proceeding apace in the inland floating solar field, where developers are exploiting opportunities to situate new solar arrays without taking up precious land (see more stories about waterborne solar arrays here).

Part of the activity is focused on taking advantage of available space on water supply reservoirs or cutting costs at water treatment facilities, which are notoriously hungry energy-suckers. The US has been a little late to the party, but activity has begun to ratchet up in several states, including New Jersey, Michigan, and North Carolina among others.

One recent example is a newly commissioned floating solar array on a retention pond at the Southern Regional Water Supply Facility in Orange County, Florida. The array is expected to reduce energy costs at the facility by 25%.

Don't just take our word for it. Earlier this month the market research firm Coherent Market Insight stated that the global floating solar market is ""projected to grow from USD 35.1 million in 2023 to USD 215.9 million by 2030 at a CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 29.6%.""

""Floating solar panels provide a sustainable option for generating electricity by utilizing underutilized water bodies such as reservoirs, dams, and ponds,"" CMI explains. ""This market opportunity is further fueled by government initiatives and incentives promoting the adoption of renewable energy technologies.""

As Moss notes, improvements in land-based solar technology have rippled into the floating solar field, contributing to growth in the market. According to CMI that also include new tracking technologies, which enable solar panels to tilt towards the best light.

Express

DHARMAPURI : Residents of Alakattu tribal hamlet in Pennagaram taluk urged the Dharmapuri district administration to pave a way to polling stations in the neighbouring village of Erimalai.

""To reach the polling station at Erimalai we would have to trek at least 5 kilometre through rugged, hilly terrain. This journey is tedious and clearing an adequate path would help us greatly,"" stated residents.

Alakattu village is one of the most isolated villages in Dharmapuri district. The tribal hamlet has over 180 voters who cast their votes in the polling station at Erimalai, a neighbouring hamlet located nearly 5 km away.

""To exercise our democratic rights we would have to trek through the forest in hilly terrain to reach the polling station. Creating a small pathway would greatly help us ease the journey,"" demanded Alakattu residents.

Speaking to TNIE, S Pasuvaraj, a resident of Alakattu, said, ""Recently, the Dharmapuri administration paved roads for the residents of Erimalai and Kottur to ensure successful polling. We in Alakattu have to trek through the forest to reach the polling station. We risk encounters with wild elephants and boars. Creating a small pathway for us to Erimalai would be helpful. The elderly and even children accompanying adults to the polling booth would also benefit.""

Another resident, R Mathesh from Alakattu, said, ""We already have a footpath connecting the two villages. The problem is the terrain is too uneven and people would severely find it difficult to traverse the terrain. Usually it takes about one hour to reach Erimalai by foot. However, widening the existing path would ease the journey. We do not want any roads, a wider path would be enough to ensure that we can safely reach the polling station.""

Pennagaram Tahsildhar S Sugumar said, ""We have taken efforts in many tribal hamlets to ensure ease of access on polling day.

The Caribbean generally doesn't come to mind first. But, one of the United States' most beautiful parks is out there east of Puerto Rico, and it takes up most of Saint John, one of the Virgin Islands.

In fact, that's what it's called: Virgin Islands National Park.

Like many other places in the Caribbean, sometimes things are great and sometimes things are not so great. Sadly, some of those not-so-great times in the history of the Virgin Islands was plantation slavery when the islands were owned by Denmark. Then known as the Danish West Indies, the main exports were sugar, cotton, and indigo dye. Eventually, this became unprofitable and the islands fell into neglect until World War I.

Fearing that the neglected and unwanted islands might fall into German hands and serve as a U-boat base, the United States offered to buy them from Denmark, finishing the sale in early 1917. After World War II and the embargo on Cuba, the islands became a major tourist destination, with people from the mainland United States able to get an authentic Caribbean experience without needing a passport to go back home.

While things did improve over time, one major problem help from the United States government couldn't solve was hurricanes. Catastrophic damage came with Hurricane Hugo in 1989, followed by hurricanes every few years with varying amounts of damage, from minor to severe. But, in September 2017, Hurricane Irma did the most damage in recent history, followed by a second Category 5 hurricane (Maria) just two weeks later.

Today, the Virgin Islands National Park both serves as a beach vacation destination (with plenty of scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities) but also a place to learn about the history of the island, both under U.S. and Danish rule. Plus, there's great information about the island's history before European contact, hiking trails, and scenic opportunities.

Along with the rest of the island, the national park took a pretty good hit in all of the hurricanes, including the most recent category 5 double whammy. The park had to be closed for weeks, with all parts of the park ready for visitors again about two months later. Despite repairs being done quickly, the visits to the park took a big hit the following year, which in turn wasn't great for the economy of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Along with the hurricanes, one other abundant weather phenomenon in the Virgin Islands is sunshine. So, it makes natural sense (and was recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) to use that sunshine to improve energy reliability and lower the park's environmental impact. After all, the island's only utility company generates electricity exclusively through fossil fuels and there's a five-mile underwater set of wires that feeds the park! This means regular power outages.

So, the National Park Foundation (NPF) helped to get funding together to install a serious solar system at the Cruz Bay Visitor Center. With 60 panels, peak power is 19 kilowatts. Annually, the system should generate about 31,400 kilowatt-hours, or about 70% of the building's energy use. On top of the solar power, the building now has better windows, roofs, and doors to both make it more energy efficient and take less damage the next time a tropical storm or hurricane comes through. A better HVAC system, LED lighting, and window treatments all add up to serious savings.

More importantly, the visitor center also serves as the offices for the park's rangers, who have been scattered in other buildings since the 2017 hurricane double-header. With repairs set for completion this month, the rangers will all be back in the same building and able to more effectively work together.

This is part of a larger National Park Foundation effort to expand solar energy at national parks all over the United States. Among others, Acadia National Park in Maine and Big Bend National Park in Texas are all getting some solar love. Combined with other efforts, the overall goal of the National Park Service and National Park Foundation is to work toward net zero for all of the parks.

You can learn about other NPF efforts here, but I'll share some of their other achievements and goals below.

Another dirty but exciting effort is the ""Don't Feed The Landfills"" initiative. Instead of needing to send everything to a local landfill (which might end up being on the park itself in more rural areas like Big Bend), the idea is to get more recycling going, do more composting, and otherwise try to keep things going to cleaner places. Some of this requires expensive sorting bins, sorting facilities, and more.

Another important effort is to conserve other resources like water. Not only is it good to make sure bottles have a shot at getting recycles, but it's also good to encourage people to use water refill stations to avoid such waste altogether. I've personally used such stations at Petrified Forest National Park and at the Grand Canyon, and they helped us make much better use of our metal water bottles.

Like better waste management, this requires expensive infrastructure and upgrades, along with planning to integrate water management into all park operations. None of this equipment and planning expertise comes cheap, but NPF helps get the money together to get the job done.

Another very cool project the Foundation participated in was to bring electric buses to Zion National Park. A grant helped the park replace ICE buses with battery-electric buses that are perfect for low-speed people moving that the park needs to do, especially during the busy season.

But, it's important to note that the National Parks Foundation isn't like Scrooge McDuck in Duck Tales, with a huge safe full of gold coins to swim in. The only way these projects happen is through donations, big and small. The average person can do a small one-time or monthly donation, but companies like Coca-Cola and Subaru pitch in millions. Either way, if sustainability at parks is important to you, they're the people to give some ammo to.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Jennifer Sensiba,-0.03529411764705881,448948366,12,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Virgin-Islands-National-Park-Solar-Array.png,

China is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy and also holds near-monopolies on the globe's renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain. Last year alone China produced more solar panels than the U.S. has ever produced in total.

China's dominance in electric vehicle battery components and solar power panels has rattled Western governments, including those of the European Union and the United States, which blame Beijing's ""huge"" state subsidies. The U.S. has responded with its own subsidies and incentives to boost American production.

China is also the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels and the globe's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. But analysts say that puts Beijing in a good position to partner on renewable energy growth with a somewhat surprising group -- oil producers in the Persian Gulf.

Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait and Iraq produced about a third of the world's crude oil in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But they're also diversifying away from those industries with help from China, say analysts.

Energy and Geopolitics Researcher Elai Rettig at Israel's Bar-Ilan University tells VOA it's a mutually beneficial investment as the shift to green energy will free up oil for sale to the Gulf's main consumers in Asia, especially China.

""In that region, oil is cheaper than water,"" notes Rettig. ""The more you invest in the Gulf, the more you can trust they'll see you get oil even under sanctions. China is the biggest oil importer in the world and needs to make sure someone will sell them cheap oil if there's a confrontation with the U.S.""

But it's less about the Gulf states' love of China and more about Beijing's ability to deliver on large-scale projects at lower costs, says Li-Chen Sim, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

""The Chinese can produce low-priced, polysilicon for solar panels because labor costs are cheaper, so products are cheaper. Solar model assembly in China is 50% cheaper than in Europe,"" she told VOA.

Western countries have raised tariffs on Chinese imports and offered fresh subsidies to encourage domestic competition. The European Union this month approved import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and is considering them for solar panels.

The EU this month moved closer to banning products made with forced labor, which is expected to include polysilicon components for solar panels made in China's western Xinjiang region, which supplies nearly half the global demand.

The United States stopped all imports from the region in 2022 as part of a crackdown on forced labor imposed on the region's ethnic Uyghur Muslim minority, which China denies.

Despite pushback from the West, plunging solar prices are making it harder to compete with Chinese manufacturers.

Nonetheless, China has some competition when it comes to renewable energy in the Gulf States, says Sim.

""China plays a role [in the Gulf] in the financing, contractor and equipment sectors -- in financing they are significant. But in fact, not as significant as the Japanese,"" she said. ""Japan's role in green energy financing in the Gulf is huge.""

During his July 2023 Middle East tour aimed at promoting Japan's green technology and regional economic ties, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signed signed 23 agreements with the UAE to strengthen cooperation and existing partnerships.

Japan in 2017 became the first country in the world to formulate a national hydrogen strategy with plans to become the first ""hydrogen society.""

But it will have to compete with China, already the world's top producer and consumer of hydrogen, though most of it is generated with high-carbon emission fossil fuels like coal.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.3568627450980393,448948151,1,,

* Experts: How governors can cope with new minimum wage

Many of the 36 states are in a quandary on how to cope with payment of the new minimum wage according to reports from some of the states.

Negotiation is already intensifying between the federal government and labour over the new minimum wage with investigation showing that six states

Abia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Kebbi, Nasarawa and Zamfara- are yet to implement the current minimum wage of N30,000,almost six years after its introduction.

Four other states -Ebonyi, Benue, Kogi and Osun - are only paying the minimum wage to workers on levels one to six and in the case of Osun, beneficiaries are those from level 7 and below.

Many of the states have also not done well in the payment of wage award to workers to cushion the effect of the current rise in the cost of living, according to a report prepared for the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).

In the NLC report sighted by states confirmed as paying the current minimum wage are: Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Borno, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kwara, Lagos, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Taraba and Yobe.

The excuse often given by the states that have not been paying the minimum wage is paucity of funds.

Although the monthly allocations to the three tiers of government have increased substantially in the aftermath of the fuel subsidy withdrawal, the defaulting states are still foot dragging on effecting payment of the minimum wage.

The situation appears even worse in respect of payment of wage award by the states.

Only Ondo and Lagos states are recorded as having paid anything close to the N30,000 per month for a half year as initiated by the federal government.

Some other states pay amounts ranging between N10,000 and N25,000 while some have not even paid anything yet.

States yet to pay the wage award are: Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Edo, Kaduna, Kebbi, Kogi, Nasarawa, Rivers, Taraba and Zamfara.

Akwa Ibom is said to have paid palliative allowance for Christmas only while Anambra paid only N12,000 and Niger State N20,000 also in December.

Delta paid N10,000 for September, October and November.

Reports from the states said the governors were not amused by the high figures demanded by labour activists during the recent zonal public hearing on the minimum wage organized by the 37-member committee set up on the issue by the federal government.

The figures range between N447,000 and N850,000 per month.

The committee which is headed by a former Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Bukar Aji, has six governors among its members: Mohammed Bago (Niger State, representing the North Central); Bala Mohammed (Bauchi State, representing the North-East); Dikko Radda ( Katsina State, representing the North-West);Charles Soludo (Anambra State, representing the South-East); Ademola Adeleke (Osun State, representing the South-West); and Otu Bassey (Cross River State, representing the South-South).

Also on the panel are Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun; Minister of Budget Economic Planning, Atiku Bagudu, and the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr. Yemi Esan.

The governors, who said unrealistic demands from Labour would not do anyone any good, urged the Minimum Wage Committee to consider the capacity of the states to pay the new minimum wage.

The committee is scheduled to meet again later this week.

Experts: How governors can cope with new minimum wage

A former Director-General at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf, believes that the states can pay a reasonable minimum wage if they have the right policies in place.

""Well, the point is that the states are getting more revenue now and so, their capacity to pay has increased,"" he told The Nation by phone yesterday.

He added: ""There is no doubt about that. But the major thing I think they can do to meet up with the minimum wage obligation is to take a cue from what the federal government is doing.

""Many of them (states) have over-bloated workforce, whether at the state or local government levels. Some of them do not need more than half or two thirds of the current workforce that they are carrying.

""There are so many idle hands in the state bureaucracies. There are too many political appointments and too many people on their payrolls. So, they have to also prune down that.

""Because if you must engage people, you must give them a wage that makes sense. You don't just engage people for the sake of engaging them. What is worth doing at all is worth doing well. ""So, let them just retain the size of the workforce that they can give a wage that is a bit reasonable, especially given the realities of inflation that all of us are facing now. I think those are the things I think they should do first and foremost.

""Then of course, they should also be more creative in getting more revenue internally. Many of them are too dependent on the federal allocation. So, they need to be a lot more creative.""

On whether the state governments need to consider raising taxes in order to jack up their revenue base, Yusuf spurned the idea, but would rather they get more ingenious with the tax administration.

""Asking the states to boost their revenue profile is not about raising taxes at all. It's about efficiency in tax administration. In many of the states, their tax administration system is so very loose. People are doing business in those places and it is their responsibility to pay tax. We are not talking about increasing the taxes regime. We are talking about efficiency, we are talking about using technology to ensure that the citizens' taxes, especially the corporate citizens also live up to their statutory obligations to the government.""

According to him, ""Some people are doing businesses across the states and some of those businesses are doing well and some of them are not paying any taxes at all. If you go to some of those states, you have some big properties that people have built there; it's not poor people that built them there. In many of those places, many of them are not paying any form of taxes. So, the point to make is about efficiency in tax administration.""

Pascal Efe, a public affairs analyst, shares the same sentiments with Yusuf. ""I agree that a new minimum wage is indeed inevitable given the current state of affairs. What the state governors can do is to ensure proper management of their resources by cutting down on many wasteful expenditures. That way they can pay the minimum wage and still be able to carry our critical infrastructure in their respective states.""",thenationonlineng.net,news,"Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf,0.04313725490196085,448948108,1,https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01045045/NLC-3-Labour.jpg,eng-9419566

Philippine naval vessels were involved in a clash with the Chinese coast guard on Saturday while attempting to resupply troops at a contested outpost in the South China Sea.

A Philippine civilian boat, escorted by two navy ships and two coast guard vessels, was on a monthly supply run to a small number of Filipino marines stationed on the ""Sierra Madre"" - a warship intentionally run aground on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 in order to reinforce The Philippines' territorial claims in the area.

Manila says Chinese ships were 'irresponsible'

According to a statement from the Philippine coast guard, one of its ships was ""impeded"" and ""encircled"" by a Chinese coast guard vessel and two ships from the Chinese maritime militia.

Philippine authorities said one of its vessels had been damaged by a water canon during the ""dangerous maneuvers"" undertaken by the Chinese, who it said had showed a ""disregard"" for the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS).

The statement accused he Chinese ships of ""irresponsible and provocative behavior.""

China, which claims most of the South China Sea as its territorial waters, has regularly deployed vessels to monitor and disrupt efforts to resupply the ""Sierra Madre"" and described Saturday's operation as ""control measures.""

In a similar incident in March, Manila claimed that four Filipino sailors had been injured and two boats damaged.

No injuries have been reported this time.

US, Japan support Philippines

The United States and Japan immediately expressed support for the Philippines and alarm at the aggression of Chinese forces off Second Thomas Shoal.

US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that Washington ""stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the dangerous actions by the People's Republic of China against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea.""

Japan's ambassador-designate to Manila, Endo Kazuya, reiterated his country's ""grave concern on the repeated dangerous actions by the Chinese coast guard in the South China Sea, which resulted in Filipino injuries.""

Meanwhile, Chinese coast guard spokesperson Gan Yu said the Philippine vessels

intruded into what he said was China's territorial waters despite repeated warnings.

(AP) -- Three people in a hot air balloon in Minnesota escaped largely unscathed after their basket clipped a power line, fell to the ground and caused a brush fire.

A Minnesota Department of Transportation traffic camera captured the accident on video. It happened around 6:50 p.m. Wednesday in Rochester. Police said preliminary information indicates the pilot was trying to land in a field when a gust of wind pushed the balloon into a power line that runs along Highway 63.

The video shows the basket and balloon become disconnected as sparks fly from the power line. The basket appears to hang briefly on the line before falling about 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters) to the ground. Meanwhile, the balloon lifts higher into the sky and drifts away.

The pilot and two other passengers were able to get out, even as the sparks caused a brush fire to break out. Police said in a news release that two people reported ""very minor injuries."" Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze.

The balloon was found later, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away, police said.

The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.

The host city of Virginia Beach would receive a quarter of that total over 40 years and another $275 million in cumulative property tax revenue from the power grid interconnection. The latter comes out to just under $7 million a year across four decades, which can then be reinvested into the community.

The development, construction, and operations of Kitty Hawk Wind would also bring a cumulative $4 billion to Hampton Roads, which includes Virginia Beach.

""Avangrid estimates that Kitty Hawk would create more than 12,000 jobs in Virginia, 9,500 of which would be located within Hampton Roads,"" Elektrek added.

The proposed 180-turbine wind farm could generate up to 3.5 gigawatts of renewable energy -- enough to power 1 million homes and reduce emissions by nearly 1.7 million tons, which is how much 500,000 cars produce every year. Avangrid also pledged to implement measures and practices ""that will be least disruptive to the community and environment.""

""Energy supply in the region is critical to maintaining and growing the economy,"" said Hampton Roads Chamber CEO and president Bryan Stephens. ""The Kitty Hawk Wind Project has the potential to supply our growing energy needs, provide new tax revenue to the City of Virginia Beach, and help the state meet the clean energy goals of 100% renewable electricity supply by 2045.""

Avangrid would build the turbines in federal waters 36 miles from Virginia Beach and 27 miles from North Carolina's Outer Banks. It won the 122,405-acre lease area during a 2017 auction directed by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

According to Elektrek, the wind farm faces an uphill climb to fruition. For one, the company hasn't found a customer for the power supplied by Kitty Hawk, nor has it started the application process with the BOEM.

More importantly, Virginia Beach leaders have protested the project, expressing concern about how the offshore wind project would affect property value and tourism. However, no official vote occurred, so Avangrid is still free to sway city leaders or consider other options.

Kitty Hawk does have a supporter in David White, the executive director of the Virginia Maritime Association executive, who said that the ""opportunity presented by the Kitty Hawk Wind project for our industry and the community must not be allowed to slip away.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.223529411764706,448947413,12,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jL_YuLHf8d76JY3yPgh0Ow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/edb1e04bdc61135a52ba35457328d7d5,

Mitsubishi Motors is also a pioneer in electric vehicle innovation - especially hybrid EVs. The company launched the i-MiEV - the world's first mass-produced electric vehicle in 2009, followed by the Outlander PHEV - the world's first plug-in hybrid electric SUV in 2013.

On 01 February 2024, Mitsubishi announced the global debut of new hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) models of the Xpander and Xpander Cross crossover MPVs. The HEV models are produced at the Laem Chabang Plant of Mitsubishi Motors in Thailand, and will go on sale shortly.

The Xpander, launched in 2017, is a crossover MPV which combines the comfort and versatility of an MPV with the bold styling and road performance of an SUV. The Xpander Cross, launched in 2019, is the top variant on the series. The Xpander series sold over 130,000 units globally in 2022.

The HEV models combine Mitsubishi Motors' trademark electrification and all-wheel control technologies to raise the appeal of the Xpander series to another level. Newly developed based on the brand's plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), the HEV system delivers a uniquely eco-friendly and exhilarating driving experience.

At its core, the newly developed system features EV driving, hybrid driving and regenerative braking, working together to deliver high fuel efficiency and an exhilarating drive by automatically switching to the most optimal driving mode based on driving conditions and battery charge level.

Powered by the best of all worlds

When starting and at low speeds, the vehicle's electric motor is powered by the drive battery alone. When driving uphill or accelerating, the system switches to hybrid driving powered by electricity generated by the engine as well as the drive battery. When driving at high speeds, hybrid driving uses the engine with assistance from the electric motor. During deceleration, kinetic energy is recovered via regenerative braking and converted into electric power, which is then stored in the drive battery.

This HEV system makes it possible to enjoy the quiet, clean ride of an EV with no fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for short drives, and switch to the convenient, comfortable ride of an HEV for long drives without anxiety about battery charge.

The new HEV system combines a generator and a motor with a maximum output of 85 kW, with a 1.6L gasoline engine, as well as a dedicated drive battery developed specifically for the Xpander HEV. This allows torque to kicks in swiftly when starting and accelerating, helping drivers smoothly change lanes on highways and merge after U-turns on city streets.

The newly developed 1.6 L DOHC 16-valve MIVEC4 engine adopts a high expansion ratio cycle (Atkinson cycle) to achieve better fuel combustion efficiency while also incorporating the first ever electric water pump in a Mitsubishi engine to reduce mechanical loss. Overall, this improves fuel economy by around 10% compared to CVT models while also improving the fuel consumption by approximately 34% in urban driving according to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test, and approximately 15% in urban and extra-urban driving combined.

It was the biggest attack on the Ukrainian power system since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted fewer than half of 88 missiles fired on various parts of the country during the night.

The attack and power outages prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to again urge foreign allies to accelerate military aid.

There are no two ways to describe the current performance of the power sector in Nigeria. This is perhaps the worst experience in recent times.

With the blackout spreading to virtually all parts of the country, observers said it is a big indictment on the Federal Ministry of Power which is gaining the notoriety of giving excuses in place of power supply to Nigerians after nine months of being in the saddle.

The current power outage in Nigeria has caused immense anguish among its citizens. Nigerians are grappling with the inconvenience of living without electricity, which affects nearly every aspect of daily life. From the inability to refrigerate food to disruptions in businesses and healthcare services, the power outage exacerbates existing challenges faced by many Nigerians.

The frustration stems from the recurring nature of power outages despite promises of improvement from authorities. The situation highlights the urgent need for systemic reforms and investments in Nigeria's energy infrastructure to provide consistent and reliable electricity to its people.

In its state of nervousness over the growing complaints from Nigerians, the federal government last week, gleefully announced that it had summoned the leadership of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) and Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) to explain the worsening power supply in their franchise areas, covering 10 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

The Minister of Power, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, who summoned the Chief Executives of AEDC and IBEDC because supply has been exceptionally bad in those regions also issued marching orders, asking the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to withdraw licences of non-performing electricity distribution companies, DISCOs.

This is even as power generation dropped year-on-year (YoY) by 21 per cent to 3,475MW in March 2024, from 4,404MW in the corresponding period of 2023, due to many problems, especially low investment and inadequate gas supply.

But, on month-on-month (MoM) to 3,475mw in March 2024, from 4,043MW in February 2024, thus causing many Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) to embark on loading.

The government accused the DisCos of not doing enough to improve supply despite the availability of power on the national grid.

Adelabu who stated this during a meeting with the head of the agencies in Abuja, said the distribution segment remains the weakest link in the electricity supply value chain.

Adelabu stressed that NERC must look for creative ways of getting the DISCOs to improve supply including the imposition of stiff sanctions on utilities which fail to pick their allocations and outright cancellation of licences.

Mounting Legacy Debts

In his explanation, the Minister of Power blamed the unfortunate situation on issues like the legacy debts to the power generating companies.

""Today, we owe a total of N1.3 trillion to the power generating companies, out of which 60 per cent is owed to gas suppliers.

""Now, if you add N2 trillion legacy debt owed to gas companies and the N1.3 trillion being owed to GenCos, we have an inherited debt of over N3 trillion in this sector. How will the sector move forward? Nigerians deserve the right to know this.""

Implementation of Cost-reflective Tariff

Apart from the burden of debts, analysts explained that the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) is in a mess currently because the call for the implementation of cost reflective tariff is yet to be adopted.

The reality is that Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people still depends on just 4,000mw of electricity supply to power their homes and businesses.

Operators complained that the expansion of infrastructure in the sector has been hampered by the fact that despite having invested over N3trillion, the absence of a cost-reflective tariff has prevented them from recouping their investment and discouraged them from committing more resources.

With such constraints, although the total national installed generation capacity stands at 13,000MW, Nigeria barely manages to get a third of that to where power is needed. The rest is stranded.

Thus, what this means is that there's a misalignment of the entire value chain from gas to consumers. Without cost-reflective tariffs, the federal government has been forced to subsidise the real cost of electricity.

Low Allocation of Gas

Reports said the various gas-fired grids in the country were not getting enough gas supply, leading to low allocation to electricity distribution companies.

Early this year, the Eko Electricity Distribution Company told its customers that it was not getting enough allocation from generation due to gas shortages and other related issues.

""Kindly be informed that the present reduction in power supply across our network is due to gas shortages and other related issues arising from the generating companies,"" the EKEDC said in a post on its social media handles recently.

Replying to outcries from its customers, the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company recently said Discos was not getting enough allocation to serve them.

""If we get the supply, we have to give it out. If we don't get it, we cannot give it. Electricity is to our benefit. If we give you a 24-hour supply, you will pay us our money. It is an allocation issue. Discos are not getting enough allocation,"" the company said.

Vandalism

One other factor militating against regular power supply is the issue of vandalism of power assets.

Unfortunately, vandalism of power assets has become unrelenting in Nigeria. Reports stated that vandals recently destroyed two transmission towers, Tower T372 and T373 along Kaisata village, which supplies electricity to parts of the North-east, thereby adversely disrupting the power supply in Borno and Yobe states.

Between January and June 2022, reports recorded the vandalism of several transmission towers and lines including in Oku-Iboku, Akwa Ibom State, 330KV Sapele to Benin transmission lines, 132KV Enugu to Benue transmission line, 330KV Osogbo to Akure, 132KV Papalanto/Ojere double circuit transmission line in Abeokuta, causing power outages.

The Eko Electricity Distribution Company stated that it lost over N1.2 billion of its assets and electrical installations to vandalism and cable theft in 2022. This has led to several outages and the death of innocent residents.

Recently, there was an incident of power asset vandalism in the Federal Capital Territory, which plunged Abuja and its surrounding areas into darkness.

Also, the TCN said Tower 70 along its 330KV Gwagwalada-Katampe transmission line was freshly vandalised recently, leading to the loss of bulk power supply and volume of power into Abuja by 250 megawatts. A similar incident occurred in the Gwarimpa-Katampe area in December. There should be constant patrols of critical national assets to check vandalism in the country.

Among other issues, the Discos have not metered over 50 per cent of their customers more than 10 years after privatisation.

Despite privatisation, the government has intervened repeatedly in the energy sector to the tune of N7 trillion between 2015 and 2023. Consumers, including ministries, departments, and agencies are owing billions of naira in electricity bills. The sole national grid collapsed again on February 4; it suffered the same fate thrice in 2023.

Observers noted that some of the problems enunciated above are not new as successive administrations have always been raising issues of vandalism, and lack of adequate gas among others. The question then is why has it been difficult to address these issues which will give Nigerians the opportunity to enjoy an uninterrupted power supply. For how long will the current leadership at the power ministry continue to give excuses for the failure to justify their positions?

Given the place of power in the nation's development, the federal government should as a matter of urgency wade into the crisis, having identified some of the issues plaguing the sector.

The federal government cannot be mouthing lifting millions of Nigerians out of poverty without taking the power sector very seriously. All over the developed economies, efficient electricity drives both the MSMEs and the big manufacturing sector

""The damage to the energy system of Kharkiv was severe and the situation is very, very difficult,"" mayor Ihor Terekhov said on television. The power supply will not be restored until at least Monday, he said, and there is a limited availability of water and heating because those systems depend on electricity.

Kharkiv was hit by 22 missiles on Friday, regional mayor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram on Saturday. It was the biggest attack on the Ukrainian power system since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted fewer than half of 88 missiles fired on various parts of the country during the night.

The attack and power outages prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to again urge foreign allies to accelerate military aid.

Missile Barrage Raises New Worries on Ukraine's Nuclear Safety

Kharkiv suffered another missile strike on Saturday and a non-residential industrial zone was hit, mayor Terekhov said. Ukrainian Railways dispatched a special food train to Kharkiv to deliver meals and food to residents.

Only 35% of households had electricity as of late Saturday and 50% of households had heating, according to the mayor. Public transport and city street lights aren't operating because there isn't sufficient power, and transformer stations and power grid lines were damaged, he added.

Locals are being advised to reduce electrical consumption where it is available, charge power banks and stock up on water and food. Power cuts will continue as repairs of the grid are underway. Around 700,000 households lost power after the attack.

In Odesa, where the power system was also damaged by Russian strikes, electricity was being rationed as of Saturday, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram.

The Philippine military released video of what it said was a nearly hour-long attack off Second Thomas Shoal in the contested South China Sea, where Chinese ships have unleashed water cannon and collided with Filipino vessels in similar stand-offs in recent months.

China Coast Guard and other vessels ""once again harassed, blocked, deployed water cannons, and executed dangerous manoeuvres"" against a routine rotation and resupply mission to the shoal Saturday morning, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said.

""Their reckless and dangerous actions culminated with the water cannoning of UM4 causing severe damage to the vessel and injuries to Filipinos onboard,"" it said in a statement, referring to the supply boat Unaizah May 4.

The task force did not say how many people on the boat were injured nor identify them or describe their injuries.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims from other countries including the Philippines and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.

Despite the attack, the task force said the damaged vessel and a coast guard escort ship that came to its aid later deployed rigid-hull inflatable boats to deliver its cargo and personnel to the Filipino outpost.

The Philippine soldiers stationed on the shoal live on a derelict navy ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, and require frequent resupplies for food, water and other necessities as well as transport for personnel rotations.

China Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu said in a statement that the Philippine resupply ship ""tried to forcefully intrude into the adjacent waters of Ren'ai Jiao"", using the Chinese name for the Second Thomas Shoal, despite the Chinese side's repeated warnings and route controls.

The China Coast Guard carried out ""lawful regulation, interception and expulsion in a reasonable and professional manner"", Gan said, adding that Philippine ships had attempted to ""transport construction materials"" to the BRP Sierra Madre.

""We warn the Philippines that playing with fire is an invitation of disgrace, and the China Coast Guard is ready at all times to defend the country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,"" Gan said.

The Philippine task force said the country ""will not be deterred -- by veiled threats or hostility -- from exercising our legal rights over our maritime zones, including Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal which forms part of our (exclusive economic zone) and continental shelf"".

The latest confrontation came four days after visiting Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States stood by its ""ironclad"" commitments to defend longtime ally Manila against armed attack in the South China Sea.

Two days after Blinken's visit to Manila, the China Coast Guard also tried to drive away Filipino scientists who landed on two cays near Scarborough Shoal, another contested South China Sea outcrop.

US ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said that Washington stood with Manila against China's ""repeated dangerous maneuvers & water cannons to disrupt (the Philippine Coast Guard's) lawful activities in the (Philippine) EEZ"".

Carlson also accused Beijing of violating international law and Philippine freedom of navigation in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

The Unaizah May 4 was joined Saturday by an escort of two Filipino coast guard vessels and two Philippine Navy ships, a Philippine military statement said.

The military handout video clips showed a white ship repeatedly dousing another vessel sailing alongside it with a water cannon. One clip showed two white ships simultaneously firing water at the same vessel.

Another clip showed a white ship marked ""China Coast Guard"" crossing the bow of a grey vessel it identified as the Unaizah May 4.

The vessel was also damaged in a China Coast Guard water cannon attack in the same area on March 5 that left four crew members injured.

The military released yet another video clip which it said showed a Chinese inflatable boat deploying ""floating barriers to prevent further entry of any vessels in the shoal"".

Another video released by the Philippine Coast Guard showed what it said were three Chinese coast guard and other vessels blocking the BRP Cabra, one of the Unaizah May 4's coast guard escorts.

Apart from supplies and equipment, the Philippine military said six navy personnel were delivered to the BRP Sierra Madre on Saturday, replacing one soldier who was recently evacuated on medical grounds.

The damaged supply boat and its escorts sailed back to port after completing their mission around noon, the task force said.

Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.05882352941176472,448946691,12,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108743101,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-252348,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-9418993

""We will also prioritise patronage, ensuring sustainability in their operations, aligning with President Bola Tinubu's renewed agenda,"" he said, adding that ""it is a must to have significant local content in the power sector's projects and contracts.""

He highlighted efforts to enact legislation mandating local content in the power sector, similar to the oil and gas industry. ""That is the only way local producers can be sustained,"" Adelabu said.

""But, we need to start developing capacity in terms of investment infrastructure and also ensure mass production. We need to develop local capacity to avoid importation.

""We must have a comprehensive plan for full backward integration so that the locally manufactured products will be achieved. We need to start training our people in technical training.""

The reason behind this forthright rejection of elections is ostensibly straightforward - the failure of the Narendra Modi government to fulfil its promise to create an autonomous division for eastern Nagas, known as the 'Frontier Nagaland Territory'.

What's behind this demand for autonomy by the eastern Nagas? Will New Delhi grant it?

As with most cases of demands for ethno-political autonomy in the Northeast, the movement for a separate 'Eastern Nagaland' can be traced back to a long colonial history of frontier management and line drawing.

Beginning in the mid-1860s, the British colonial administration began to put in place a bifurcated regime for administering the Naga hills. While it brought western Nagaland under formal control by establishing the 'Naga Hills District' in 1912, it left the east out of its administrative remit due to its relative remoteness. This created an unequal political geography across what later became 'Nagaland.'

The west received colonial developmental largesse, which the east was deprived of. Needless to say, an economic divide between both regions emerged, in turn festering adverse mutual perceptions between the western and eastern Nagas. In fact, in the late 1880s, eastern Nagas violently attacked western Naga villages, even provoking preventive raids by colonial forces who sought to defend their subjects in the west.

Since then, eastern Nagaland remained a distinct political entity in one form or the other for many decades, through various phases of administrative realignments. In 1914, it was brought under nominal colonial control under the 'Assam Frontier Tract Regulation'. Then, the Government of India Act 1935 designated it as a 'tribal area' while flagging western Nagaland as an 'Excluded Area'. After Indian independence, eastern Nagaland was formally classified as 'Tuensang District' and incorporated into the 'North East Frontier Tract (NEFT)'. It became the 'Tuensang Frontier Division' when NEFT became the 'North East Frontier Agency (NEFA)' in 1954.

Three years later, the 'Tuensang Frontier Division' was severed from NEFA and clubbed with the Naga Hills to form the 'Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA)'. This merger was further consolidated when Nagaland was given full statehood in 1962. While Tuensang enjoyed a fair degree of political autonomy even after Nagaland became a state, it was this awkward merger with western Nagaland that created the foundations for the 'Eastern Nagaland' statehood movement, steered by the ENPO.

The colonial legacy of unequal governance rolled over into postcolonial angst among eastern Nagas against the Kohima government, which was widely accused of short-changing the east. The ""land of the backward people"" - that's how Chingmak, an eastern Naga, described his homeland to anthropologist, Jelle JP Wouters, as narrated in his 2018 book 'In the Shadows of the Naga Insurgency', during his fieldwork in Noksen.

The current ENPO-led movement for a separate 'Eastern Nagaland' state formally began in 2011. 'Frontier Nagaland Territory' - that's what they call their envisioned future state, which is currently composed of six districts. The ENPO, which was formed in 1997, claims that Union home minister Amit Shah promised to accept their demand on December 7. However, negotiations appear to have stalled since then, and legislators from eastern Nagaland are now camping in the national capital in the hope of resuming talks with the home ministry.

Importantly, the eastern Naga representatives have chosen to directly talk to New Delhi, rather than go through the Nagaland state government, which is currently led by Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party. In fact, the Rio government in Kohima has maintained a passive distance from the negotiations. In 2022, it clarified that the issue was between eastern Nagas and the central government.

This reveals a continuing trust deficit between the eastern Naga representatives and Kohima - a vestige of colonial history. In that sense, the central government is well-placed to play the role of a neutral arbiter. However, the issue is more complicated than it looks.

The centre is currently in talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM) to find a permanent solution to the Naga conflict, which began in the 1950s. It signed a 'framework agreement' with the armed group in 2015, but negotiations have flatlined since. If the centre agrees to carve out a separate eastern Naga state from Nagaland, NSCN-IM, which seeks to create a single Naga homeland called 'Nagalim' with a separate flag and constitution, might abandon the peace process. Essentially, the centre is faced with a peculiar demand for double autonomy.

Alternatively, New Delhi could, through multi-stakeholder talks, figure out an arrangement in which it creates a 'Frontier Nagaland' state that reports to a 'Nagalim' government. This, however, will be as complicated in reality as it sounds on paper. What is needed is an honest quadrilateral dialogue between New Delhi, Kohima, ENPO and the NSCN-IM to identify a viable way forward.",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,-0.1294117647058823,448946339,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/23/1600x900/The-ENOPO-has-been-demanding-a-separate-Frontier-N_1711220724239_1711220789570.jpg,

Vandalism of critical power generation and transmission equipment has also made the lives of residents difficult. To get an understanding of the real issues of power supply in the country, senior business reporter Melody Chikono (MC) caught up with deputy Minister of Energy and Power Development Magna Mudyiwa (MM) on the sidelines of the Global Renaissance Investments Zimbabwe's Infrastructure Investment Summit in Victoria Falls last week. Below are the excerpts of the interview;

MC: You said part of the challenge in efficient electricity supply in the country has been obsolete equipment at the main power stations in Zimbabwe. How are you dealing with this issue?

MM: For now, the Hwange Power Station which has six units has only been operating three to four units. The other two units are out due to breakdowns. At times we go down to two units due to breakdowns as most units are obsolete and have lived their lifespan. We have plans to rehabilitate Hwange Power Station at the moment. The plans are at an advanced stage and the rehabilitation is earmarked for all the six units.

MC: So concerning current power shortages, what plans do you have in the pipeline?

MM: As a government we have plans to improve the power situation. We have the Hwange expansion project which will bring 600 megawatts, 300 from unit 7 and the 300 by February from unit 8. So adding 600 megawatts to our generation capacity at the moment will bring the total capacity to about 2 100MW, enough for the country's needs as we implement other renewable projects. We have IPPs willing to do solar projects throughout the country. We have a company from Dubai that wants to do 500MW and the agreement was signed recently and this will add more electricity to the grid. We are also encouraging private companies to have solar energy installed at their premises.

MC: What is the value of these IPPs and other projects in the pipeline?

MM: I don't have the figures at the moment but what I can say is they will add 500-700 MW to our grid.

MC: You have indicated that Hwange 7 may fail to meet the deadline due to some challenges. What are the challenges?

MM: Yes the unit was supposed to be commissioned in November but there are challenges. There are issues of payment with the contractor Sino-Hydro, a company from China contracted to undertake the Hwange 7 and 8 projects. The Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) has been in arrears for some time and is failing to clear the arrears due to foreign currency shortages. I think some arrangements have been made that they pay up their arrears and the contractor has since resumed work. Again that project has also been delayed due to Covid-19. But the project is now at over 90% progress judging by what is on the ground. I don't have the details of the exact figures but these issues have been raised to us as the ministry.

MC: You said Zesa has lost 1 282 transformers in the past five years. This is a huge number. Why is the country failing to curb this?

MM: Vandalism is a serious challenge. We get a report of vandalism every day on transformers, copper and aluminium conductors. Considering the number of transformers that means providing protection to all of them is a big challenge. What happens is that vandals attack any transformer when you least expect. But installation of physical barriers is something that ZETDC has not been doing in the past. They were just installing transformers in the middle of the forest.

Vandals would then come and feast on the transformer and it has been a challenge monitoring their movements. ZETDC does not have the technology to monitor its infrastructure but we are working with the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education and the University Of Zimbabwe (UZ) on a programme to come up with monitoring equipment. We are encouraging locals to monitor transformers in their areas and some communities have been providing physical security in protecting transformers.

MC: There have been allegations that the installers of transformers have been behind the recent spate of transformer theft. What is your take?

MM: Investigations have been conducted and it has proven that those are Zesa employees. So far we don't have that confirmation. What happens is that sometimes Zesa hires contract workers and when the contract expires, one has to go away. Maybe those contractors then take advantage of their knowledge of the system. We haven't confirmed that they are Zesa people but investigations are ongoing.

MC: In your presentation you said ZENT, the company that manufactures transformers is incapacitated. What are the issues?

MM: Zent at one point was totally incapacitated, failing to manufacture transformers despite having the capacity to do so. The issue is on forex needed to buy the components of transformers, copper wires and other components. These are imported.

I can confirm that Zent recovered funds through a loan and purchased the required components. However they are not sufficient to service the whole nation and the demand for new installations is increasing. Zent is also falling to meet the demand.",theindependent.co.zw,news,The Zimbabwe Independent,Melody Chikono,-0.05098039215686279,448946145,12,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/theindependent/uploads/2022/09/AzfVmSJ6W6dY34bqEAHWneMfRbMWc2AboOzlcfLM.gif,

ATLANTA (AP) -- Dejounte Murray made a season-high seven 3-pointers while scoring 28 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Charlotte Hornets 132-91 on Saturday night to strengthen their hold on the final spot in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.

Bruno Fernando scored a career-high 25 points and Garrison Mathews had 20, each in backup roles. Atlanta opened a five-game homestand with its first home win over Charlotte since Nov. 20, 2021. The Hornets took home wins in the first two games of the season series.

Murray was 7 of 9 on 3s and set a season high with 12 assists as he continued to handle lead point-guard duties in the team's 14th consecutive game without injured All-Star Trae Young, still recovering from a finger injury.

""We miss Trae, but when you have a point guard like (Murray), it makes the offense go,"" Mathews said.

The Hawks matched their season high with 20 3s, including four from Mathews. Coach Quin Snyder said Murray set the pace on 3-pointers.

""The way we were playing tonight, it starts with him,"" Snyder said. ""You saw it with the catch-and-shoot 3s.""

The Hawks are 5 1/2 games ahead of No. 11 Brooklyn for 10th in the East.

Miles Bridges scored 27 points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight and 11 of 13 and were eliminated from playoff contention. Charlotte was close before falling behind in the second period, but coach Steve Clifford said he saw his team's struggles begin in the opening period.

""It really happened in the first quarter,"" Clifford said. ""As soon as we started subbing, our intensity went downhill and we really didn't get it back.""

Brandon Miller had 13 points while Nick Richards added 12 points with a season-high 16 rebounds. Vasa Micic scored eight points, ending his streak of 10 consecutive games scoring in double figures.

Young is the most prominent member of the team's long injury list. Forward Onyeka Okongwu (left big toe) was held out after playing in the final two games of a five-game road trip.

Okongwu missed 13 consecutive games with the toe injury before his return on the road. Snyder would not say before the game if Okongwu aggravated the injury.

Fernando helped fill the void left by Okongwu's injury. Fernando tied his career high of 19 points with a powerful one-handed jam to open the fourth quarter. He set his career high with a short jumper two minutes later.

Forward Jalen Johnson sprained his right ankle in Monday's loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed 16 games with a wrist fracture earlier in the season and is expected to miss at least one week with the ankle injury.

Hornets forward JT Thor (left shoulder) did not play.

Following the last tie at 39-all, the Hawks closed the first half with a 27-9 run to lead 66-48 at halftime. Atlanta's bench outscored Charlotte's reserves 60-22.

After a month of relatively low activity, at 0130 UTC on March 23, the sun produced an ""X1.1 class"" solar flare -- followed by almost a dozen smaller ""M-class"" solar flares and a bright coronal mass ejection.

It could mean bright aurora -- and an extra special sight during April 8's total solar eclipse, an event already predicted to show onlookers a huge coronal streamer.

Since it traveled to Earth at the speed of light, the solar flare caused a temporary radio blackout over the western Pacific Ocean. According to SpaceWeather.com, the CME triggered by the solar flare is likely to cause G1-class (minor) to G3-class (strong) geomagnetic storms on Earth late on Monday, March 25, and early on Tuesday, March 26.

G1 would mean aurora around the Arctic Circle, whereas G3 would mean aurora visible from the northern U.S. states on the border with Canada.

However, what would really excite solar physicists -- and eclipse chasers -- is if a CME went off during the 100 minutes that the totally eclipsed sun will be visible across North America on April 8.

A solar flare is an eruption of electromagnetic radiation in the sun's atmosphere caused by twisted magnetic fields above a sunspot. Sunspots are cooler, darker regions of the sun's surface that form when chunks of its magnetic field rise from deep within our star.",endtimeheadlines.org,news,End Time Headlines,End Time Headlines,0.223529411764706,448945944,1,https://endtimeheadlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shutterstock_1693629247.jpg,eng-9420215

Yet, crafting effective policies requires a strong foundation of evidence and knowledge. This is where knowledge generation comes into play.

In this article, there is an exploration of how effectively harnessing the power of knowledge creation can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact.

Strategies for leveraging knowledge generation for policy impact

Specifically, sector impact evaluation programmes should be scaled up. This involves deploying a team of research and operational staff to collaboratively develop data and analysis, including through impact evaluation, to inform future sector-specific operations. In tandem, country research programs, which help develop the underlying data ecosystem and enhance the capacity to use advanced analytics to improve efficiency in government processes, should be expanded. Increasing the scope of these efforts would help reduce the costs of generating and disseminating knowledge by fostering long-term relationships with client governments and other in-country evidence partners, and in turn, help overcome challenges related to generating and sustaining demand for high-quality evidence.

ince impact evaluation currently depends on insufficient and at times uncertain external trust fund resources and fragmented operational interest, new dedicated resources are needed to undertake evaluations more strategically and systematically. The leadership could consider different financing mechanisms, each with their benefits and drawbacks.

There are several options for financing impact evaluation and related evidence activities. One option in low-income countries is to designate a share of the regional International Development Association (IDA) window for data and evaluation functions, including impact evaluation.

Where feasible, this funding could be used to support national evaluation and evidence entities in both the public and private sectors. Dedicating a relatively small portion of IDA resources to evaluation-related functions would enhance the overall impact, and therefore represent good value for money.

Another option in both low- and middle-income countries is to establish a defined allocation of IDA lending towards data and research for all financed operations. Integrating these essential functions across all lending operations would help generate data and evidence that is operationally relevant and responsive to a client country's decision-making needs. However, this approach could also introduce some risks; bundling knowledge production and lending functions may raise concerns related to conflict of interest when governments are both judge and jury of evaluation results, necessitating the need for an approval structure where researchers review the available evidence base before loan approval.

Third, the development partners for instance World Bank should also continue to produce research and evidence, including through trust funds, in addition to systematically integrating funding for data and evaluation-related activities into operations.

As such, trust funds should be adequately funded to support evaluations and related evidence functions that are not necessarily project-specific, including studies that measure longer-term outcomes beyond the time horizon of a specific operation, are regionally focused, and/or relate to global public goods.

Data repositories can help decrease the cost and increase the speed of knowledge generation. Tapping into tax data, current data, and other administrative data sources would also help make evidence generation faster and cheaper, but requires greater investments in data collection, quality, and infrastructure (including national statistical systems) to link these data sources to each other and make them accessible and usable for researchers and policymakers.

More equitable evidence-to-policy partnerships would increase the quality, relevance, and visibility of development partner's research and evaluation work within client governments, national universities, and civil society groups, as well as at the global level. While the development partners already pursue numerous partnerships with external research organizations that play a critical role in capacity strengthening and demand generation, there is scope to expand. The development partners currently contract country-based survey firms through one-off consultancy agreements, including through vendor shortlisting and open competition.

Where feasible, the development partners should shift to providing medium-term financing for select organizations with the potential to build their evaluation capacity and expand their client base to interested governments and other research funders.

The development partners could also co-invest with partner research organizations in local evaluation firms to further develop the enabling ecosystem for evidence generation and use, though current procurement rules would likely need to be changed.

Further, the development partners can provide policy lending to support government-based or semi-autonomous evidence-to-policy initiatives, which are proximate to information on policy windows and ideally structured by design to ensure research questions align with government priorities.

Lastly, creating an internal roster of local partners in client countries including universities, researchers, research consortia, and survey firms would be a helpful resource for staff as they seek to expand the scope of impact evaluations and related evidence activities.

Furthermore, incorporate diverse perspectives by including stakeholders like industry experts, NGOs, and community representatives in the knowledge generation process.

In conclusion, the power of knowledge generation lies not just in its creation, but in its translation to actionable insights. By fostering collaboration between knowledge producers and policymakers, employing targeted communication strategies, and building robust knowledge ecosystems, we can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact. This virtuous cycle of knowledge informing policy and policy driving further research will equip us to tackle complex challenges and create a more informed and equitable future. As the world continues to evolve, our ability to leverage knowledge generation effectively will be paramount in ensuring that policy decisions are not simply well-intentioned, but demonstrably effective.

In his music, the tale is always continual. The narratives do not let go of the past but never shy away from embracing the sensibilities of the present. When he sings, multiple eras are recreated. The audience is forced to oscillate between the past and present, evoking both tradition and modernity.

Rajasthani folk musician Kutle Khan, who has mastered more than nine percussion instruments, and moves between genres with smoothness insists that it is important not to forget the past as it paves the way to the future. Perhaps that is the reason he is now exploring ancient Rajasthani songs and planning on presenting them in a format that is 'accessible' to the newer generation.

""Currently I am focusing on very old Rajasthani folk songs, and presenting them in a way that the young relate to them. I will be fusing them with newer instruments from both Indian and Western music to ensure that the young are acquainted with the richness of our culture. I really want that everyone gets touched by the wind of Rajasthani music,"" he tells.

Khan, who will be at the Music Festival Kasauli -- MKF 2024, curated by Naani Singh, that will be held on March 29 and 30 at Santa Roza, says, ""People will get to listen to a lot of new sounds -- from Rajasthani culture to my own renditions of Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's best-known numbers.""

Khan, a singer and musician who plays dholak, khartal, bhapang, harmonium, sarangi, morchang, and also writes and composes his songs, moving with ease between different genres stresses, ""Rajasthani folk is always the base in my work, no matter what. Of course, I also sing classical and Sufi, but the thrust is to introduce people to the enigmatic music of my state.""

Belonging to the 14th generation of musicians, Khan, who was also honoured as the 'Best Folk Singer of the Year' by the Indian Icon Film Awards in the year 2019, stresses that singing in Kasauli is always a treat.

""The ambience, the audience, the whisper of the winds from pine trees... everything becomes magical in this hill town that is unadulterated in the true sense. I always look forward to coming here.""

For someone who has performed in more than 80 countries, even in front of non-Indian audiences, it is the richness of folk that makes the audience ask for more. ""They are very open to new sounds and what they do to them. Of course, considering Western instruments are also incorporated, they do not feel completely alienated from what is happening on the stage. But their willingness to embrace what is not a part of their culture always touches me.""

Stressing that it is important for him to add contemporary elements to ancient Rajasthani folk, the musician says, ""Look, I also want the young to acquaint themselves with our legacy. And what is wrong with including Western sounds? Frankly, I have never had a problem with purists as they also understand that certain elements need to be included to make folk 'relevant' to youngsters.""

However, in his much talked about 'Sounds of Desert', he sticks to pure Rajasthani folk.

""It is a musical production of 19 artists where the audiences get to listen to pure Rajasthani folk. There is no fusion. And it is always well received across age groups.""

Besides an active touring circuit, Khan, who also has TV shows like 'Dewarists', 'MTV Unplugged' and 'Coke Studio India' to his credit, feels multiple elements make Rajasthani folk enigmatic, thus ensuring full-houses.

""We use multiple instruments, the tonal quality is unique and the pitch is high. Not to mention, our unique get-up. Precisely why you get to witness audience members stand up and start dancing.""

The artist, who has given his voice to movies like 'Afwaah' and several web series, besides Tollywood films and has five albums to his credit, is a firm believer in collaboration.

He has toured with Susheel Raman, Ranjit Barot, Amit Trivedi, Afsana Khan, Jonita Gandhi, Karsh Kale, Darhan Doshi Collective, and says, ""Working with musicians across genres is always an enriching experience. You not only get acquainted with other schools but also begin to challenge yourself.""

Considering his popularity, the musician often gets calls from individuals to become their guru.

""Sadly, I am unable to do that. I have been travelling non-stop for the past 15 years, and it would be unfair to become a teacher if I am unable to give full attention to my students. However, I do guide them, telling them what to study, and looking up videos on streaming platforms.""

All set to perform in Maldives and London after Kasauli, he hopes, ""I pray that youngsters acknowledge the richness of our own culture and what it has to offer.""",thehansindia.com,news,The Hans India,Sukant Deepak,-0.003921568627450966,448945390,1,https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/03/24/1433041-kutle-khan.jpg,

Bruno Fernando scored a career-high 25 points and Garrison Mathews had 20, each in backup roles. Atlanta opened a five-game homestand with its first home win over Charlotte since Nov. 20, 2021. The Hornets took home wins in the first two games of the season series.

Murray was 7 of 9 on 3s and set a season high with 12 assists as he continued to handle lead point-guard duties in the team's 14th consecutive game without injured All-Star Trae Young, still recovering from a finger injury.

""We miss Trae, but when you have a point guard like (Murray), it makes the offense go,"" Mathews said.

The Hawks matched their season high with 20 3s, including four from Mathews. Coach Quin Snyder said Murray set the pace on 3-pointers.

""The way we were playing tonight, it starts with him,"" Snyder said. ""You saw it with the catch-and-shoot 3s.""

The Hawks are 5 1/2 games ahead of No. 11 Brooklyn for 10th in the East.

Miles Bridges scored 27 points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight and 11 of 13 and were eliminated from playoff contention. Charlotte was close before falling behind in the second period, but coach Steve Clifford said he saw his team's struggles begin in the opening period.

""It really happened in the first quarter,"" Clifford said. ""As soon as we started subbing, our intensity went downhill and we really didn't get it back.""

Brandon Miller had 13 points while Nick Richards added 12 points with a season-high 16 rebounds. Vasa Micic scored eight points, ending his streak of 10 consecutive games scoring in double figures.

Young is the most prominent member of the team's long injury list. Forward Onyeka Okongwu (left big toe) was held out after playing in the final two games of a five-game road trip.

Okongwu missed 13 consecutive games with the toe injury before his return on the road. Snyder would not say before the game if Okongwu aggravated the injury.

Fernando helped fill the void left by Okongwu's injury. Fernando tied his career high of 19 points with a powerful one-handed jam to open the fourth quarter. He set his career high with a short jumper two minutes later.

Forward Jalen Johnson sprained his right ankle in Monday's loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed 16 games with a wrist fracture earlier in the season and is expected to miss at least one week with the ankle injury.

Hornets forward JT Thor (left shoulder) did not play.

Following the last tie at 39-all, the Hawks closed the first half with a 27-9 run to lead 66-48 at halftime. Atlanta's bench outscored Charlotte's reserves 60-22.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security. | Reuters

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

The significant event held in Islamabad symbolized the profound partnership between the United States and Pakistan and their shared commitment to progress and collaboration.

USAID's Mission Director, Kate Somvongsiri, received the award on Samantha Power's behalf. In a video message, Administrator Power expressed her gratitude, underscoring the pivotal role of USAID in supporting Pakistan during challenging times. She reiterated USAID's steadfast commitment to standing with Pakistan, guiding it through the recovery process and toward a brighter future.

Despite falling prices of both new and used electric cars, price remains one of the major barriers to buying. Even when you factor in government support in the form of VRT relief and grants, the purchase price can still be higher than comparable petrol or diesel cars.

But the price is only one variable so to properly compare the cost of an electric car with a petrol and diesel car you need to work out the financial cost of owning an EV or the total cost of ownership.

The total cost of ownership (TCO) therefore is the purchase price of a car plus the running costs of charging, motor tax, insurance and maintenance.

Assessing the total cost of ownership means you can evaluate the lifetime cost savings of an electric car and take into account the main differences between EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

Charging in the comfort of your own home is not only the most convenient way to charge but also the cheapest. According to the AA Ireland February fuel price survey, EV owners will pay on average €900.43 a year, compared to the December average of €967, to cover the national average of 17,000km a year.

This figure of €900 remains elevated far above the prices before Russia invaded Ukraine. However, the trend looks to continue downwards as the wholesale price of electricity has been coming down steadily over the past few months so EV drivers are seeing the benefits in their pockets.

For context, AA Ireland has calculated that a similarly sized diesel vehicle will cost approximately €2,047 to cover that same distance of 17,000km. But remember you need to shop around to get the cheapest rates possible on home electricity.

Insurance is often related to the purchase price of the car and therefore can be higher for electric cars. Some insurance companies offer specific discounts to EV drivers so, as always, shop around.

Fresh data released by the Election Commission of India on Thursday shows that vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech International Limited and three other firms related to it donated Rs 25 crore to the Telugu Desam Party in January.

Bharat Biotech gained national prominence for producing and distribution the Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin following the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.

Two-time chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is the head of the Telugu Desam Party, which was voted out of power in Andhra Pradesh in 2019. Assembly elections will be held in the state on May 13 this year.

The donations by Bharat Biotech and related firms to the TDP, even though it is not ruling the state, may be the consequence of professional and personal relationships between members of the Kamma community. It has historically been dominant in business, building a symbiotic relationship with Naidu, who belongs to the community, through his years in power.

Bharat Biotech purchased 10 electoral bonds of Rs 1 crore each on January 6. Three other firms linked to Bharat Biotech also contributed to the Telugu Desam Party's coffers in the same month.

Chiron Behring Vaccines Private Limited, which Bharat Biotech announced it was acquiring in February 2019, bought bonds worth Rs 5 crore on January 6. Three days later, on January 9, RCC Nutra Fill Private Limited - which manufactures microbiology media - purchased bonds worth Rs 5 crore. Chemical products manufacturer Biovet Private Limited bought bonds for Rs 5 crore.

RCC Nutra Fill and Biovet share directors with Bharat Biotech. Sai Prasad Devarajulu, Bharat Biotech and Chiron Behring's whole-time director, is also a director at RCC Nutra.

Raches Virendradev Ella, the son of Bharat Biotech founders Krishna M Ella and Suchitra Ella, is a full-time director of Biovet and the chief development officer of Bharat Biotech, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The founders' daughter Jalachari Ella is the other full-time director at Biovet. Her LinkedIn profile states that she is the head of corporate strategy at Bharat Biotech. The total donations by Bharat Biotech-related companies to Telugu Desam Party amount to Rs 15 crore.

Project Electoral Bond asked representatives from the Telugu Desam Party and Bharat Biotech about these donations. The article will be updated if they respond.

Bharat Biotech also has ties to another prominent personality in Andhra Pradesh known to be close to Naidu, the media baron C Ramoji Rao. In 2017, Raches Virendradev Ella, the son of the Bharat Biotech founders, married Ramoji's granddaughter Sahari Cherukuri.

The Ellas, Ramoji, and Naidu all belong to the Chowdary or Kamma community, a landed and politically influential group in the state.

Since the ascendancy of the Telugu Desam Party in 1983, political power in Andhra Pradesh - even after the bifurcation of the state in 2014 - has typically changed hands between Kamma chief ministers from the Telugu Desam Party and Reddy chief ministers from the Congress and the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party.

The connections between Bharat Biotech's Krishna Ella and Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu date back at least three decades. Ella said that in 1996, he had advised Naidu, who was then the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, to set up a biotechnology park to enable manufacturing and research.

Bharat Biotech was one of the first companies to set up base there after it was established. The park in Hyderabad, now known as Genome Valley, has since grown into a hub for businesses in the life sciences sector and is home to more than 200 companies.

In 2020, when Modi visited Bharat Biotech's facilities to review the production of Covaxin, Naidu counted it as a personal triumph in a series of tweets about the cluster's inception. He also thanked the ""brave and brilliant minds at Bharat Biotech"". A year later, NV Ramana, a former chief justice of India who also belongs to the Kamma community, argued that the vaccine was being criticised ""because it was made in India"".

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Bharat Biotech faced scrutiny over Covaxin. The vaccine was granted approval in January 2021 by India's drug regulator, the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation, even before results from Phase 3 of the vaccine's clinical trial were known.

A few months later, as the second wave of Covid-19 devastated lives across the country, Naidu criticised the Andhra Pradesh government for the shortfall in vaccines.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, in response, alleged that Naidu's links to Bharat Biotech had a hand in causing the shortage. Reddy is the head of ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party.

Over the past two decades, Ramoji and his family members have been embroiled in alleged financial irregularities in the Margadarsi Chit Fund Private Limited, with the case gaining renewed momentum since 2022.

Among the largest businesses of its kind, Margadarsi Chit Funds was founded by Ramoji in 1962. This operation became the financial backbone for the expansion of his empire as he forayed into several industries including advertising, news, and fertilisers.

In August 2023, the Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department registered 10 first information reports against Margadarsi Chit Fund under sections of the Indian Penal Code, including those for cheating, breach of trust and fraud.

Ramoji and C Sailaja Kiron, his daughter-in-law and the managing director of Margadarsi Chit Fund, were named in the FIRs among others. Kiron is Raches Ella's mother-in-law.

A senior official from the state Crime Investigation Department claimed that thousands of subscribers of the fund had not received payments. It also said that the company was running chit fund memberships without the knowledge of some of those listed as supposed members, amounting to impersonation to misappropriate funds. Margadarsi said that there had been no financial irregularities and that all its profits had been earned without ""touching"" the money of its subscribers.

The case is seen as part of the rivalry between the Ramoji-owned Eenadu, Andhra Pradesh's largest-selling Telugu newspaper, and the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led state government. The origins of the proximity between Eenadu and the Telugu Desam Party can be traced back to 1983, when the party's founder, actor-turned-politician NT Rama Rao, won a historic victory against the Congress.

A little over a decade later, when Rao was ousted in an intra-party coup waged by his son-in-law, Naidu, Ramoji deployed his newly-launched channel ETV in favour of the younger politician. Sakshi, a rival newspaper, was founded by Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2008 and continues to be owned by his family.

Reddy frequently disparages a selection of media organisations, in particular Eenadu, as being ""yellow media"" - an allusion to the propaganda he believes they spread against his party, and to their alleged links with the Telugu Desam Party, which has a yellow party flag.

In February, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Margadarsi Chit Fund seeking the transfer of a criminal appeal pending against the company in Andhra Pradesh High Court to the Telangana High Court.

Both High Courts have been hearing similar matters pertaining to Margadarsi. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the transfer petition, stated that if need be, the company can file a stay of appeals before the Andhra High Court.

In August 2023, the special courts of Guntur and Visakhapatnam returned two chargesheets filed by the Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department in relation to allegations of financial irregularities, diversion of funds and other charges against Ramoji Rao and Sailaja Kiron.

The state Crime Investigation Department has not filed any chargesheets in the remaining cases.

Yonhap

The fourth unit of the Korean-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, Korea's state-run utility company said Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.

Despite the election dates being announced, there seems to be no resolution in sight, raising concerns reminiscent of the alliance's fate in 2009. The crux of the issue lies between two key players: Lalu Yadav's RJD and the Congress.

Talks regarding seat distribution have hit a deadlock, with neither side willing to yield further ground. Efforts to finalise a deal have thus far been fruitless, even prompting discussions at the highest levels. However, neither Sonia Gandhi nor Lalu Yadav have managed to bridge the gap. Leaders within both parties have conveyed to their respective high commands their reluctance to concede any further and have expressed readiness to contest alone if necessary.

Congress had initially demanded 10 seats but halted negotiations when this wasn't met. RJD, on the other hand, offered 8 seats despite initially proposing 6. Talks are now centred around finding common ground, with Congress pushing for 9 seats. However, disagreements persist, particularly regarding the allocation of specific constituencies.

Tensions have arisen over the Sasaram-reserved seat, which Lalu Yadav is reluctant to concede for Meira Kumar, who in turn has refused to contest. Similarly, disagreements over other constituencies, such as Madhepura and Purnia, further complicate matters.

Adding to the complexity is pressure from within the parties. Senior Congress MLA Ajit Sharma is advocating for his daughter Neha Sharma's candidacy in Bhagalpur, adding another layer of contention.

The spectre of past rifts looms large, particularly recalling Lalu Yadav's political manoeuvring in 2009. His unilateral decision to allocate seats without consulting Congress led to a rupture in the alliance and dismal electoral outcomes for both parties.",news9live.com,news,News9live,Dimple Singh,-0.05882352941176472,448943885,1,https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rahul-Gandhi-and-Lalu-Yadav.png,

One of the best experiences I've had while living in the Tri-Cities is taking the Reactor B tour offered by the Department of Energy. The tour is a fascinating trip into the past to learn the importance of the Hanford Nuclear Site during World War II.

Does Washington State Have To Worry About A Nuclear Strike?

There are still a lot of misconceptions about the site and the clean-up currently being done outside of Richland Washington. Some still believe the site has functioning nuclear reactors hence all the security but that is a myth propagated like Area 51 in New Mexico.

Michelle, the host of our tour was fantastic and she answered the questions especially the one on the site's secrecy.

She stated that with today's technology, any nation could easily from orbit peer into Hanford and the work that is getting done.

She said that it was not much of a secret if a rival nation wanted to spy on Hanford because they could easily do it from space.

We, of course, still think Hanford gives us Area 51 vibes but she said it's mainly clean-up of the nuclear waste left behind and decommissioned nuclear reactors so mundane stuff at best.

I did do a little digging on what are the odds that the Hanford site would be a potential nuclear strike site in case of a war and I was surprised by the information I found.

According to a map provided by the Natural Resources Defense Council, If there was a 500-warhead strike from a rival nation, the odds are slim that Hanford would be a target but if there was a 2000-warhead strike, then Hanford could be a potential target.

As you can see, the coast of Washington State is more likely a target but again we hope it never comes to pass.

Image: George Osodi/Bloomberg

Nigeria removed fuel subsidies entirely in May 2023. This came as a surprise because of the political risks associated with subsidy removal. Previous administrations were reluctant to jettison the subsidies.

The subsidies had been in place since the 1970s, when the government sold petrol to Nigerians at a price below cost - though most consumers weren't aware of this.

The 1977 Price Control Act made it illegal for some products (including petrol) to be sold above the regulated price. The Olusegun Obasanjo regime introduced this law to cushion the effects of inflation, caused by a worldwide increase in energy prices.

Fuel subsidies have been controversial in Nigeria, and some analysts see them as inequitable. Very few Nigerians own vehicles.

Nigeria is among the countries with the least number of vehicles per capita, with 0.06 vehicles per person or 50 vehicles per 1 000 Nigerians.

So critics have argued that the subsidies benefited mainly the elites even though they could afford to buy fuel at market prices.

The subsidies were also considered to be a drain on public finances, costing the government US$10 billion in 2022. About 40% of Nigeria's revenue in 2022 was spent on fuel subsidies.

Fuel subsidies in Nigeria were notorious for their opacity and graft. Billions of dollars were said to have been lost through corrupt practices in the payment of the subsidies.

These are some of the reasons they were removed.

But now questions are being asked about the way it was done. In a public opinion poll conducted last year, 73% of Nigerians said they were dissatisfied with the manner in which the fuel subsidy was removed.

As an economist who has studied the Nigerian economy for over four decades, I can see why the fuel subsidy had to go.

As I argued in a previous article, fuel subsidies were bad for the Nigerian economy. They worsened budget deficits and the country's debt profile, encouraged corruption, and diverted resources away from critical sectors of the economy. They were also inequitable, transferring the national wealth to elites.

But, it has become clear from the unprecedented inflation in the country partly caused by the removal of fuel subsidies, the abrupt removal of the subsidy was not the best strategy to use.

I believe this action should have been staggered over several months. This would have provided a soft landing, and gradually exposed Nigerians to the full market price of fuel.

Doing so in one fell swoop amounts to shock therapy that is very traumatic for an already beleaguered and impoverished citizenry.

Why removing the subsidy should have been gradual

The Bola Tinubu administration could have chosen from various mechanisms to minimise the negative impact of subsidy removal.

As proposed by the World Bank, a temporary price cap would have ensured that fuel price increases did not inflict too much pain on consumers. This approach would also have enabled the government to significantly reduce, but not eliminate, the fiscal burden of the subsidy.

Read: Nigeria gets $800m from World Bank to cut fuel subsidy

Another approach is periodic price adjustments: setting the price based on a moving average of previous months' import costs. These adjustments could have been made together with a price cap. The Philippines is one country that successfully removed fuel subsidies in the 1990s, using the price adjustment mechanism.

Gradually phasing out subsidies would have been a better approach for a number of reasons.

Firstly, Nigerians had become suspicious of government's intentions, given their economic experiences with the previous administration of Muhammadu Buhari. Those experiences include high inflation and unemployment rates, rising poverty and insecurity.

Tinubu should have re-established government credibility and good intentions first.

He could have offered economic succour such as cash transfers and food subsidies for poor Nigerians, wage increases for workers and retirees, scholarships or tuition waivers for indigent students in tertiary institutions, free lunches for primary and secondary students in public schools, and subsidised public transport.

After demonstrating he meant well, he should have gradually rolled out the subsidy removal. Nigerians would have been psychologically prepared for what was coming, including inflation.

The inflationary impact of subsidy removal would have been less severe. Nigerians would have been more tolerant of difficult economic policies. People will accept difficult economic policies if they know their government is humane and pro-people.

Secondly, an incremental approach would have enabled the government to come up with programmes targeted at those most likely to be hurt by subsidy removal.

This would have ensured buy-in. The ""palliatives"" introduced by the Tinubu administration and state governments are temporary and have a limited reach.

Gradual subsidy removal would have enabled the government to engage with groups that would be affected by the policy. Groups representing labour, manufacturers, students, women and others could have provided insights into what would be needed to help their members adjust.

This interactive approach would have promoted transparency and credibility in the conduct of government policies.

Many vulnerable Nigerians were already under severe economic pressure. Apart from high unemployment and poverty rates, inflation was biting very hard.

The abrupt removal of fuel subsidies, without first putting in place shock-absorbing measures, will make it more difficult for the government to achieve the policy's long-term aims: fiscal sustainability; higher levels of investment in productive sectors of the economy; economic growth; and investment in renewable energy.

Minimising the negative impact of subsidy removal

Tinubu should minimise the negative impact of subsidy removal and liberalisation of the foreign exchange market. These two phenomena interact to cause the inflation that the country is facing.

First, savings from ending the subsidy should be used to develop productive capacities in agriculture, labour-intensive manufacturing and services.

Manufacturing activities like agro-processing, textiles, footwear, leather products, arts and crafts should be targeted for development. This would generate high-paying jobs that might help Nigerians to cushion the effects of inflation.

In an economy that's functioning well, wages always adjust to reflect price increases. In Nigeria, however, too many people are either unemployed or in the informal sector, with limited opportunities to adjust their earnings to reflect inflation.

Funds saved from subsidy removal should be invested in public infrastructure (mass transportation, road construction, electricity generation, water supply).

Funds should also be used to develop people's capabilities through massive investment in health and education. Part of the savings should be used to support and sustain the student loan programme announced by the Tinubu administration.

Successful radical economic reforms, such as the ones implemented in Rwanda, usually give people an incentive to be more productive, creative and innovative. But policies that are punitive, with marginal or no benefits, are unlikely to succeed.

It remains to be seen whether Tinubu's economic policies will spur sustained and inclusive economic growth, as well as alleviate poverty.

Because many adult Americans do not follow dietary guidelines, poor food quality increases the risk of heart disease.

Led by Kristina Petersen and Penny Kris-Etherton, the study, published in Current Developments in Nutrition, explored how eating one avocado daily affects overall diet quality.

Petersen said, ""Avocados are a nutrient-dense food, containing a lot of fiber and other important nutrients. We wanted to see if regular intake of this food would lead to an increase in diet quality. Previous observational research suggests avocado consumers have a higher diet quality than non-consumers. So, we developed this study to determine if there is a causational link between avocado consumption and overall diet quality.""

According to Petersen, the researchers aimed to determine whether including avocados in people's daily meals may significantly enhance the quality of their diets, as just 2% of American adults routinely eat avocados.

They interviewed participants by phone before and during the study to understand their eating habits on the previous day. They assessed their diets using the Healthy Eating Index. This index measures how closely diets align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, indicating overall diet quality.

The study involved 1,008 participants split into two groups: one group continued their diet with limited avocado intake. In contrast, the other group added one avocado daily for 26 weeks.

Petersen mentioned that having an avocado daily significantly boosted adherence to dietary guidelines, indicating that simple strategies can help people follow healthier diets. Although avocados are known to enhance diet quality, researchers were taken aback by how individuals could attain this goal. Avocados were frequently utilized to replace diets heavy in sodium and refined carbohydrates.

While classified as a vegetable in the study, avocados increased overall vegetable consumption, replacing some less healthy options in participants' diets.

According to Petersen, a lousy diet significantly increases the likelihood of developing conditions, including diabetes, kidney disease, and heart disease. By helping people follow dietary guidelines better, we can lower their risk of these chronic conditions and increase their healthy lifespan. Petersen has studied other food-based interventions, like pistachios' effect on diet quality. However, more research is needed to find different strategies for improving dietary adherence.

According to Penn State researchers, eating one avocado daily may improve diet quality. Poor diets raise risks for diseases like heart disease. The study, conducted under the direction of Kristina Petersen and Penny Kris-Etherton, examined how eating an avocado every day affects diet quality. It was discovered that individuals who consumed one avocado daily had better compliance with dietary recommendations, frequently substituting unhealthy choices.

Petersen emphasizes that poor diet quality increases risks for various diseases, and improving adherence to guidelines can lower these risks. More research is needed to find other food-based strategies to enhance dietary adherence.",techexplorist.com,news,Tech Explorist,,0.1529411764705881,448943567,1,https://www.techexplorist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/avacado.jpg,eng-9419884

When Eugenio Bregolat Lukashov, a 39-year-old Spaniard who has been living in China for 26 years, was asked about China's economic development over the past two decades, he used the word ""astonishing"".

Bregolat, now president of Inditex Greater China, first came to the country when he was two years old. In fact, he's lived in China longer than any other place.

As a witness to China's economic development, he said, ""It is astonishing that China has been able to develop so rapidly over the past few decades.""

Bregolat said that when his family first arrived in China, there was even a special currency for foreigners, as they couldn't pay in local currency.

""At that time, I remember in Beijing there was only one foreign supermarket. There were very few restaurants where foreigners could eat in those days. And I believe we were the only 40 Spanish people in the whole country, not just in Beijing.""

Also, as a resident of Shanghai for 13 years, he recalled the first time that he came to the city from Beijing. The train took him many hours. Today, it takes only four and a half hours to travel from Beijing to Shanghai by high-speed train.

""I remember when I first saw Pudong, there was only the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Jinmao Tower. It's only been 20 years ago,"" he said.

Bregolat's confidence in China's economy and the Chinese market was reflected by Inditex's business strategies in the country over the past years.

The owner of brands such as Zara, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home said it will further adapt its business strategies to consumer needs and adjust store opening plans in China, renovate existing ones, exploit the power of digital platforms and remain upbeat about the local market where consumption upgrade and consumption recovery now form the impetus.

The company has sought to dispel rumors that Zara is gradually moving out of China, clarifying that it is only adjusting its store-opening strategies and increasing emphasis on opening more high-quality stores, following its global approach.

On Aug 17, Zara renovated and upgraded its outlet in Joy City shopping mall in Shenyang, Liaoning province, giving it a more digital edge. Its mobile app can detect the number of available clothing items, reserve an on-site fitting room, and pre-order and pick up goods. It also opened a new image store in Shanghai Sun Plaza and renovated its Han Street store in Wuhan, Hubei province.

""China is important for us and is a strategic market for Inditex. We will keep investing in new digital functionalities and high-quality stores in the Chinese market, and continue to open more stores in top commercial areas or renovate existing ones, so they reflect Zara's latest brand image and meet the needs of local consumers,"" Bregolat said.

He acknowledged the potential of China's consumption, as well as the inspiration the company gets from Chinese consumers.

""We all know that there are a lot of trends that first begin in China and then are exported to the world, especially with China's increasing digitalization. So we are constantly learning and taking inspiration from China and its consumers. I can feel the energy in the country, which makes me feel alive,"" he added.

Fast fashion, the category that Zara falls into, refers to a clothing production mode that quickly responds to shifting consumption demand from customers and fashion trends. It aims at taking advantage of the supply chain and cutting the cycle period from production to sales so as to offer fashionable clothing to consumers at relatively low prices.

Fast fashion has become a high-value race of sorts in the clothing sector. Before 1980, the clothing industry was dominated by a model of separated production and sales, and sales channels were mainly department stores. Due to long links, high markup rates and low flexibility in discounts, consumers could not enjoy either good quality or cost-effectiveness at the same time.

After 1980, fast fashion, perhaps best represented by Zara and Uniqlo, rose to prominence, and achieved a vertically integrated sales model encompassing product planning, manufacturing and retail sales, allowing consumers to purchase higher-quality products at lower prices.

Fast fashion in China started at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2002, Uniqlo opened its first outlet in China in Shanghai, unveiling China's development of fast fashion. Afterwards, a number of fast fashion brands, including Zara and H&M, entered the Chinese market one after another. The fast fashion sector in China experienced a rapidly growing period.

Data from industry research portal chinabaogao.com showed that in 2017, fast fashion brands had set up 416 outlets in China in total, reaching a peak in nearly a decade, and market volume surpassed 200 billion yuan ($27.8 billion).

However, since 2018, affected by the sluggish commercial real estate market, the impact of e-commerce platforms and the trend of consumption upgrading, the expansion pace of fast fashion brands in the Chinese mainland market has gradually slowed. In 2022, the growth of new domestic stores of fast fashion brands decreased to 154, a year-on-year decline of 49.51 percent, according to chinabaogao.com.

""In the past, with broad choices, fast product upgrades, rich fashion elements and high cost performance, fast fashion was popular among Chinese consumers. Now, facing a series of challenges and the fact that the dividend of the fashion era is waning, the industry has entered a stage of differentiation from the original stage of wild growth. To maintain competitiveness and realize sustainable development, fast fashion brands need to positively seek transformation. For example, they can establish diversified product portfolios, integrate online and offline channels, and highlight brand stories and culture,"" said the report from chinabaogao.com.

Zheng Lei, chief economist at cloud services provider Smydigtech, said: ""After the three-year pandemic, fast fashion brands are shifting their business strategies in China to adapt to new market environments and new consumption demand. This also reflects the change and the upgrade trend in China's consumption sector. Consumers have higher demand for quality and experience.""

Jiang Han, a senior analyst at market consultancy Pangoal, said: ""China's fast moving consumer goods sector still maintains great potential and room for growth as Chinese consumer demand for fashion and product quality constantly grows. Although some fast fashion brands are shutting down some of their outlets in China, this does not mean foreign companies are moving out of the country.

""On the contrary, they are adjusting their strategies to adapt to new changes in the Chinese market. Through high-end transformation and digital innovation, foreign companies are striving to enhance their competitiveness in the local market.""

With foreign media speculating that China's consumption remains weak and its economic growth is losing momentum, Yang Jinghao, chief economist at Concat Data Technology (Hangzhou) Co, said that the former only coincides with a statistical data gap period, while the latter is simply a replacement of concepts in macroeconomic growth models to spread pessimistic expectations.

""I hold a moderately optimistic attitude toward China's macroeconomic growth in the next two years, especially since the third quarter of last year when it was confirmed that China's economy had bottomed out in the inventory cycle. With the United States Federal Reserve launching a loose monetary policy cycle in Q3, China's external demand environment will also improve. Therefore, badmouthing China's economy at this time lacks macroeconomic logic and factual basis,"" he said.

Amid the backdrop of the three-year pandemic, China's consumption sector has continued to recover, serving as a strong driver of the country's economy. The latest data from the Ministry of Commerce showed that in 2023, China's total retail sales of consumer goods reached 47.1 trillion yuan, growing 7.2 percent year-on-year. The contribution rate of consumption to China's economy was 82.5 percent, demonstrating that the fundamental role of consumption is constantly rising.

Fast fashion, the category that Zara falls into, refers to a clothing production mode that quickly responds to shifting consumption demand from customers and fashion trends. It aims at taking advantage of the supply chain and cutting the cycle period from production to sales so as to offer fashionable clothing to consumers at relatively low prices.

In an election year, the fervour of the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh and his associates was missing at his ancestral village due to recent political upheavals in the state. Hundreds of students under the banner of the Punjab Students Union (PSU) organised a conference today and later marched to Bhagat Singh's residence at Khatkar Kalan village to demand protection of martyrs' legacies and sites associated with them.

On the occasion, PSU state president Ranveer Singh Kurd and general secretary Amandeep Singh Khiowali said the governments were leaving historical legacies associated with the state's martyrs unattended. The union leaders demanded that sites associated with martyrs Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Madan Lal Dhingra, Guru Gobind Singh and Dewan Todar Mal in Ferozepur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Ropar and Sirhind be protected and restored.

The sites which leaders referred to included the secret abode and hide out of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and his companions in Ferozepur; houses of Shaheed Sukhdev and Madan Lal Dhingra in Ludhiana and Amritsar, respectively; the historical fort of Kotla Nihang associated with Guru Gobind Singh and the haveli of Dewan Todar Mall in Sirhind.

The leaders said the sites were in a pathetic condition and needed restoration. They said historical buildings were source of inspiration for youth and the need of the hour was to protect them.

Speaking on the occasion, state leaders Amar Nath and Baljit Singh Dharamkot said dozens of writers, intellectuals, journalists and political prisoners, who had completed their sentences, were languishing in jails for no reason and should be released immediately. They said due to the New Education Policy, many schools and colleges would be closed. They said this would deprive poor students from education and private institutions would loot people.

They said education should be included in the state list of the constitution. The state government should prepare its own education policy.

Students took an oath at Shaheed Bhagat Singh's house to guard his ideology and that of his companions. PSU state leaders Dheeraj Kumar, Ravi Dhillwan, Mangaljit Pandori and DMF leader Germanjit Singh were among others who addressed the gathering.

Sans the grand and high pitched political rhetoric of the previous years, politicians visit at Khatkar Kalan village remained a low-key affair today amidst the implementation of the Poll Code of Conduct and recent arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

British rulers on March 23, 1931, hanged Bhagat Singh along with Raj Guru and Sukh Dev at Shadman Chowk here after trying them under the charge of hatching a conspiracy against the regime.

Bhagat Singh, respected across the subcontinent and not just by Sikhs and Hindus but also by Muslims, was initially jailed for life but later awarded death sentence in another ""fabricated case.""

Holding banners and chanting slogans, participants at the event held to observe the anniversary, demanded justice for Bhagat Singh.

Candles were lit at the Shadman Chowk to mark the occasion at the programme organised by the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation, Pakistan.

A resolution was also adopted during the event urging the Supreme Court to reopen the case of Singh and give him justice like it was done for Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

Bhutto was hanged through what many believe was a sham judicial trial more than 40 years ago.

Pakistan's parliament on March 13 passed a resolution, demanding the overturning of the death sentence given to Bhutto, also the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), who was executed by the military regime of Gen Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1979. The resolution was passed a week after the Supreme Court on March 6 opined unanimously that the former premier did not receive a fair trial and due process in a much-anticipated review of the high-profile case.

On March 18, 1978, the Lahore High Court sentenced Bhutto to death for allegedly ordering the assassination of Ahmed Reza Kasuri, one of the founding members of the PPP.

On Saturday, during the event, the resolution also demanded Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to grant the status of ""national heroes"" to the trio and Bhagat Singh should be awarded Pakistan's top gallantry award too, both demands made in earlier years too.

The resolution also demanded the renaming of Shadman Chowk after Singh, a matter that is already sub-judice.

Speaking on the occasion, the Foundation's chairman advocate Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi said peace is the need of the hour between Pakistan and India that will benefit millions of people.

Qureshi said the government should recognise the sacrifices of the war heroes and said his Foundation would continue to fight Singh's case till he gets his due status here where he was hanged.",navhindtimes.in,news,The Navhind Times,,0.02745098039215677,448943094,1,,eng-9420514

However, picking up a balanced line-up will be challenging for both.

As the Pink city gears up for yet another season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the home team - Rajasthan Royals (RR) - will begin their campaign against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Sunday.

Fan favourite Sanju Samson will be back in the captain's role, leading a power-packed unit that missed a playoff berth by a whisker last year. On the other hand, LSG's skipper will return after an injury layoff as the franchise will make a fresh start to their quest for a maiden title. The contest will pit two equally rounded sides against each other. However, picking up a balanced line-up will be challenging for both.

Powell and Avesh Bolster RR

West Indies all-rounder Rovman Powell will bolster the RR batting down the order, sharing the responsibilities with the likes of Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer and Riyan Parag. Fast bowler Avesh Khan, who was traded from LSG before the player's auction last year, will most likely be joining the RR bowling unit alongside Navdeep Saini and Sandeep Sharma.

The Royals are going to miss the services of pacer Prasidh Krishna who is unavailable due to injury. Also, Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa has pulled out of the tournament and has been replaced by Mumbai's Tanush Kotian.

LSG debut for Padikkal?

If Avesh went to RR, Padikkal found a new home in LSG where he would be teaming up with his Karnataka mate KL Rahul. The opening batter and veteran South African keeper-batter Quinton de Kock would be raring to go all guns blazing against his previous franchise.

Since the BCCI has asked Rahul to play as a specialist batter for now, it would be Nicholas Pooran to don the wicketkeeping gloves in the campaign opener.

Lucknow's bowling unit will be interesting to watch after the addition of young West Indies pacer Shamar Joseph. Also, some fresh faces in Arshin Kulkarni and Shivam Mavi will make the selection interesting. But in most likelihood, the management would like to keep the core group intact.

Here are the predicted XIs

The China Coast Guard yesterday morning blocked a Philippine supply vessel and damaged it with water cannons near a reef off the Southeast Asian country, the Philippines said.

The Philippine military released video of what it said was a nearly hour-long attack off the Second Thomas Shoal (Renai Shoal, 仁愛暗沙) in the contested South China Sea, where Chinese ships have unleashed water cannons and collided with Philippine vessels in similar standoffs in the past few months.

The China Coast Guard and other vessels ""once again harassed, blocked, deployed water cannons, and executed dangerous maneuvers"" against a routine rotation and resupply mission to the shoal yesterday morning, the Philippine National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said.

""Their reckless and dangerous actions culminated with the water cannoning of UM4 [Unaizah May 4] causing severe damage to the vessel and injuries to Filipinos onboard,"" it said in a statement.

The task force did not say how many people on the boat were injured nor identify them or describe their injuries.

A video clip showed a white ship marked ""China Coast Guard"" crossing the bow of the Unaizah May 4, which was damaged in a China Coast Guard water cannon attack in the same area on March 5 that left four crew members injured.

The military said the videos were taken while the Unaizah May 4 was on its way to Ayungin Shoal -- the Filipino name for the outcrop garrisoned by a small unit of Philippine troops that is also claimed by Beijing.

Despite the attack, the damaged vessel and a coast guard escort ship that came to its aid later delivered its cargo as well as six navy personnel to the Philippine outpost, the military said.

The military also released another video clip which it said was taken after the water cannon attack and showed a Chinese vessel deploying ""floating barriers to prevent further entry of any vessels in the shoal.""

More than two years after climate negotiators first attempted to consign coal to history, the dirtiest fossil fuel is having a moment.

Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programmes to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbour, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a tonne, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70 per cent. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93 per cent of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tonnes, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilise through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21 per cent over the past three years to 4.7 billion tonnes. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tonnes for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.",business-standard.com,news,Business Standard,,-0.02745098039215688,448942431,12,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-03/24/full/1711245683-216.jpg,eng-9418993

Bruno Fernando scored a career-high 25 points and Garrison Mathews had 20 for Atlanta, which opened a five-game homestand with its first home win over Charlotte since Nov. 20, 2021. The Hornets took home wins in the first two games of the season series.

Murray was 7 of 9 on 3s and set a season high with 12 assists.

The Hawks are 5 1/2 games ahead of No. 11 Brooklyn for 10th in the East.

Miles Bridges scored 27 points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight and 11 of 13. Brandon Miller had 13 points while Nick Richards added 12 points with a season-high 16 rebounds. Vasa Micic scored eight points, ending his streak of 10 consecutive games scoring in double figures.

Hawks All-Star point guard Trae Young (finger) missed his 14th consecutive game as the most prominent member of the team's long injury list. Forward Onyeka Okongwu (left big toe) was held out after playing in the final two games of a five-game road trip.

Okongwu missed 13 consecutive games with the toe injury before his return on the road. Coach Quin Snyder would not say before the game if Okongwu aggravated the injury.

Fernando helped fill the void left by Okongwu's injury. Fernando tied his career high of 19 points with a powerful one-handed jam to open the fourth quarter. He set his career high with a short jumper two minutes later.

Forward Jalen Johnson sprained his right ankle in Monday's loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed 16 games with a wrist fracture earlier in the season and is expected to miss at least one week with the ankle injury.

Hornets forward JT Thor (left shoulder) did not play.

Following the last tie at 39-all, the Hawks closed the first half with a 27-9 run to lead 66-48 at halftime.

Flood warning issued for areas along the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Del. 03:59

It may officially be spring, but New England and surrounding areas are facing a combination of wintry weather across the region on Saturday, with more than a foot of snow expected in some areas, as well as rain , wind and possible flooding in southern regions and along the coast.

In Maine, the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous day of travel with increased ice formation inland from the coast, in addition to snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland, forecasters are predicting between one and two feet of snow in Maine's western mountains and northern areas and in the White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, the weather service's senior forecaster, based in Gray, Maine.

In the Lake District from New Hampshire to Maine, totals are expected to be slightly lower, six inches to a foot, with a mix of sleet and freezing rain.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

In Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation early in the day in western and central Massachusetts before transitioning to full rain .

The heaviest rain is expected during the late afternoon and evening, extending over Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. local time, and over Rhode Island and the Eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. local time. Rain could persist on Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Dry weather overnight will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, senior forecaster with the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be windy with temperatures cooler than the average for late March, he said.

The storm is expected to have completely left the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a risk of flooding throughout the region, including far southern New Hampshire, where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains due to heavier rain this afternoon, according to the meteorological service.

Rain could also cause rivers in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts to flood. The weather service also issued flood warnings throughout Connecticut and parts of New York.

The storm comes at the end of the winter season in parts of the Northeast, including Boston, which have seen little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain in northern New England came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin received winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

Spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

Korean-built nuclear reactor successfully connected to UAE power grid | Yonhap News Agency,"SEOUL, March 24 (Yonhap) -- The fourth unit of the South Korean-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, South Korea's state-run utility company said Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a US$20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

South Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.",en.yna.co.kr,news,Yonhap News Agency,Oh Seok-min,0.419607843137255,448942095,12,https://img7.yna.co.kr/etc/inner/EN/2024/03/24/AEN20240324000800320_01_i_P4.jpg,eng-9419873

Many are anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse that is set to happen on April 8, 2024. At about noon on this date, the moon will pass between the sun and the Earth, thus darkening some parts of the planet.

The best spot in the country to see a total eclipse will be in east Texas, while much of Louisiana will see about an 80% eclipse. So yes, some parts of Texas and Louisiana will get dark in the middle of the day and it may get eery for just a few minutes.

A few years ago we experienced a solar eclipse here and while it didn't get as dark as it may this time, there was still something absent from most yards.

As the moon passed between the Earth and the sun, I noticed that everything in my yard went silent. By that I mean the insects weren't chipping and all of the birds went silent. It was such a unique experience to hear silence in the middle of the day.

So, what will happen in April when some parts of the country experience a total eclipse? Well, animals are affected by the eclipse as their mind and body are programmed by the time of the day, much like your body is too.

When the sun is shaded by the moon during the eclipse, some animals will retreat to where they sleep, while others may emerge. Those animals that come out at night may emerge in the middle of the day (like bats) because they will think it's the evening hours when it is actually noon.

If you have time during the upcoming solar eclipse (April 8th) I highly encourage you to go outdoors and just listen. If you're away from traffic, you may experience the silence that I did during the last solar eclipse.

I also encourage you to monitor your pets at home. If you have a dog, let it be outdoors during the eclipse and watch its behavior. Chances are during the solar eclipse it will want to rest and perhaps even lie down.

New Zealander Shane van Gisbergen and Austin Hill were duking it out for the lead -- and pushing each other high off the race line as the field approached the checkered flag. With those two fending each other off, Larson drove his No. 17 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet low around both and was able to pull away to a 1.215-second victory -- the only lap the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champ led all day around the 20-turn 3.51-mile road course.

Van Gisbergen finished second in the No. 97 Kaulig Racing Chevy but was accessed a 30-second penalty for exceeding track limits in that last lap battle with Hill, which ultimately put him in 27th. So Hill, driver of the No. 21 Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet officially is scored runner-up.

Larson was all smiles climbing out of car, conceding he wasn't surprised things got so aggressive in the end. He was one of the few cars -- and only one among the leaders -- to drop into pit lane on the final caution to get gas and had worked his way back up front.

""It feels really special because seems like every time we've run the 17-car - any of us four drivers - we're always fast on track and somehow give it away,'' Larson said. ""Today I was definitely not the fastest, but we were patient. I knew the 21 [Hill] had shoved SVG [Van Gisbergen] through [turn] one and if he got to him it could get dicey.

""I was just trying to be patient. I was thinking when to make my move and when I saw him shoving him through [turns] 15 and 16, I thought this could get good and thankfully I cleared them off in that corner. Pretty crazy. Just wild there. ... Really cool, just awesome to win here at COTA.''

Neither Van Gisbergen nor Austin Hill were too happy with the final outcome -- both their cars damaged from the aggressive beating and banging on the final lap. Asked if he would speak to Hill about the racing, Van Gisbergen said, ""Yeah, I guess so.'' But he was mostly positive about having a chance to win in only his fifth NASCAR Xfinity Series race of his career.

""It was a crazy race and the car got better and better,'' Van Gisbergen said. ""On that last restart he [Hill] just drove through me in [turn] one. I guess I stood up for myself. But it was pretty awesome racing with [teammate] A.J. [Allmendinger] and in the end just turned into a mess. That's how it is.

""It was really fun. Wish I could have gotten through to the lead, but the car [Larson] just snuck through there. He was driving really well. A lot of fun.''

John Hunter Nemechek finished third, reigning series champion Cole Custer was fourth and Parker Kligerman rounded out the top five. Rookie Jesse Love, Austin Green, last week's winner Chandler Smith, Sam Mayer and Allmendinger rounded out the top 10.

It was a particularly impressive day for Green, son of former Xfinity Series champion David Green, finishing eighth in his very first series start.

Brandon Jones seemingly won Stage 2 only to receive a penalty for cutting Turn 5 on the last lap of the stage.

Miles Bridges scored 27 points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight and 11 of 13. Brandon Miller had 13 points while Nick Richards added 12 points with a season-high 16 rebounds. Vasa Micic scored eight points, ending his streak of 10 consecutive games scoring in double figures.

Hawks All-Star point guard Trae Young (finger) missed his 14th consecutive game as the most prominent member of the team's long injury list. Forward Onyeka Okongwu (left big toe) was held out after playing in the final two games of a five-game road trip.

Okongwu missed 13 consecutive games with the toe injury before his return on the road. Coach Quin Snyder would not say before the game if Okongwu aggravated the injury.

Fernando helped fill the void left by Okongwu's injury. Fernando tied his career high of 19 points with a powerful one-handed jam to open the fourth quarter. He set his career high with a short jumper two minutes later.

Forward Jalen Johnson sprained his right ankle in Monday's loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed 16 games with a wrist fracture earlier in the season and is expected to miss at least one week with the ankle injury.

Tony Stewart said during a break in this weekend's Lucas Oil Winternationals at Southern California's In-N-Out Burger Pomona Dragstrip that it's too early to be an expert on all the nuances of his Top Fuel dragster.

And he claims he isn't partial to one kind of race car.

But he is certain that he never will be a Funny Car racer. And he's adamant that his spin in an 11,000-horsepower, nitro-gulping Top Fuel has a limited run, at least for the immediate future. He stepped in as a substitute this season for wife Leah Pruett, who announced in December she would step from the cockpit to focus on starting a family.

""Listen, I was just hoping I was still going to have a job after Gainesville [where he qualified ninth and bowed out in the first round of eliminations at the Florida season-opener earlier this month],"" Stewart said. ""I think if you asked Leah, she's got a different idea than what I have, but literally on my radar right now, I'm just driving this car until she's ready to come back.

""As soon as she's ready to come back, I'm going to get out of her race car. I don't care if it has my name on it. I don't care if the trailer has my name on it. That's her race car. That's her race team over there,"" he said.

""Get another one for yourself,"" someone suggested.

""I'll start a GoFundMe account,"" Stewart joked. ""It just takes money.""

He said it's ""maybe too early"" to compare the Top Fuel dragster to the Top Alcohol Dragster he began with but identified the thrust and the speed as two definite factors.

""Obviously, it leaves [the starting line] harder. It doesn't leave that much harder than the fuel car, but it just continuously pulls. It's just a way different feeling when you hit the gas,"" Stewart said. ""At least to this point, through where I'm at right now, the driving part's pretty similar. But you just know that if you have to start moving the pedal around that it can get expensive and ugly really fast if it doesn't work.""

The dragster, he said, ""steers like an IndyCar, basically. The way the steering ratios are and everything and as far as how much you move the wheel for small corrections, that part's very similar.""

His Tony Stewart Racing teammate is Matt Hagan, the four-time and reigning Funny Car champion. He made a pass in Hagan's car at Indianapolis Raceway Park last year - and promised it would be his last, not that he ever wanted a first crack at it.

""I can tell you from going to that car [the Top Fuel dragster] last year and running Matt's car at IRP last year, a Funny Car is like driving a winged sprint car. But it's like sliding the wing all the way back to the trunk. When I drove that the first run, it washed out and pointed me out through the wall, and I just didn't steer it enough. But I steered it like I would a dragster.""

After his Funny Car experience, he said he has decided he's ""probably better suited for [the Top Fuel car].""

""I didn't want to drive it,"" Stewart said, but Hagan and Ron Capps, at Capps' championship speech two years ago, were ""wearing me out about it. Hagan's kicking me the table with these cowboy boots, and I had bruises on my leg. But Hagan, ever since we started this program, he's like, 'When are you going to drive it? When are you going to drive it?' I'm like, 'I'm not. You're driving. I'm going to watch.'""

Years ago, Stewart sat in now-retired four-time NHRA champion Gary Scelzi's Funny Car at the Don Schumacher Racing shop at Brownsburg, Ind., and immediately was uncomfortable. ""I mean, it's 70 degrees in there, and as soon as they put the lid down, I started sweating like it was 105 out and 90% humidity. And he's just laughing about it,"" Stewart said. ""I'm like, 'There's no way I could drive one of these things.'

""I kind of wrote it off, but a year ago for Christmas, Leah and I got my dad a day with Frank Hawley [at the Frank Hawley's Drag Racing School at Gainesville, Fla.],"" Stewart said."" He didn't do the full school deal. [Hawley, a two-time Funny Car champion in the 1980s] just showed him enough how to drive it and just let him go run laps all day.

Probably a month before we did it, I'm like, 'Shit, if I'm going to be there all day and got to watch, I might as well drive something. I'll see if I can drive Frank's car.

The upcoming poll will feature a multi-party contest, with the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance and the opposition coalition of the INDIA bloc being the primary contenders.

The election schedule for the 18th Lok Sabha elections was announced last week. The upcoming poll will feature a multi-party contest, with the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance and the opposition coalition of the INDIA bloc being the primary contenders. The alliances are built, and major parties have announced their candidates. At the moment, it seems a onehorse race, with the BJP dominating the polls and the opposition parties trailing behind. Prime Minister Modi wants to perform a hat trick and win for the third consecutive time.

The Opposition INDIA alliance comprises 26 parties that have formed a pre-poll alliance to challenge the BJP. The coalition aims to field a single opposition candidate against the BJP in the upcoming elections. The Congress party, leading the INDIA bloc, has suffered two consecutive defeats in 2014 and 2019 and significant damage to its image. One of the party's weaknesses is its over-reliance on past successes and a need for connections with younger generations, including millennials. Congress is a 138-year secular party that used to represent marginalised groups like SCs, STs, OBCs, and Muslims. With the rise of regional satraps, it has been weakened.

The party now claims to be committed to social justice and empowering India's poor, oppressed, Dalits, farmers, youth, and women with its five guarantees: Yuva Nyay, Bhagidaari Nyay, Naari Nyay, Kisan Nyay, and Shramik Nyay. The Opposition, mainly Congress, aims to challenge Modi by consolidating anti-BJP votes and offering incentives. This strategy worked in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana in last year's Assembly polls, which Congress won. Congress hopes to gain from the BJP's anti-incumbency by offering sops and freebies. They also highlight Rahul Gandhi's recent Bharat Jodo Yatras, which were meant to connect with the people. To succeed, Congress must raise bread-and-butter issues such as inflation, joblessness, and social discord to engage with young voters who play a decisive role in many elections.

They must show an alternate strategy to address them. Some powerful chief ministers of state-level parties dominate their states, making it a tough fight for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in these areas. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and its allies secured only 45 per cent of the votes, while the remaining 55 per cent were up for grabs. Although no national leader can match Modi's popularity, some influential regional leaders can sway voters in their respective regions. This is particularly true for West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. The biggest challenge for the INDIA coalition is to project a single leader against Modi. Unfortunately, there is an ego clash among the coalition partners, which makes it difficult to agree on someone. Secondly, the BJP boasts a strong organisation with immense financial and political power.

The Opposition doesn't seem to have a solid and compelling storyline, except for its commitment to safeguarding the Constitution and democratic values. However, most voters are more concerned about basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. For instance, Sonia Gandhi's Aam Aadmi slogan in 2004 resonated well with the masses. Lowincome people generally from live paycheck to paycheck and may not relate to abstract political concepts. The Congress Party is still clinging to its glorious past and failing to acknowledge the current political climate. Congress automatically expects to lead the coalition as the secondlargest party, but other regional leaders with large egos also want to compete with them. It has been losing its leaders to the BJP, and the steady exodus demoralises the cadre.

The Opposition needs a solid counter to BJP's propaganda that they are anti-Hindu. BJP has grown since 1980; today, it is the biggest party in India. It has a strong organisation with unlimited money power. The party seeks votes in the name of the Prime Minister. Thus, the BJP has a better chance of winning this time. The BJP's mascot is Modi. His supporters consider him a proactive leader due to his successful implementation of various measures such as Triple Talaq, CAA, revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, and the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The BJP highlights its achievements in the last decade and various welfare initiatives to attract other voters.

The continuity has helped Modi achieve his agenda for the past ten years. Modi has gained international recognition over the past ten years, and India's position at the high table excites his supporters. The Opposition has accused Modi of being an authoritarian leader who is toppling opposition governments in different states. Additionally, the Modi government is accused of harassing opposition leaders. Yet another allegation is that the BJP poaches on other parties, lawmakers, and leaders.

It has absorbed many second-rung leaders who chose to find better prospects in the saffron party. The 2024 elections will see a high-pitch campaign, as this will decide the future of the Opposition and the BJP. The secret to Modi's success was a divided opposition. As long as this continues, Modi will continue to win.",thestatesman.com,news,The Statesman,,0.09019607843137245,448941425,1,https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bjp-flags-1.jpg,

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Shares of Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) have been a poor performer over the past year, trading essentially flat and missing out on a significant rally across the technology sector. The company has struggled with weak orders from wireless carriers and softness in China. Having worked down its backlog, it now faces revenue declines. Since recommending investors sell shares in November given the company's disappointing performance, KEYS stock has rallied by 11%, which has lagged the S&P 500's 15% return during that time. With the growth picture increasingly cloudy, investors who have stayed in the stock should use the rally to sell, as I expect it to continue to underperform broad indices.

In the company's fiscal first quarter, Keysight earned $1.63 in adjusted EPS, which beat consensus by $0.04, as revenue declined by 9% to $1.26 billion. KEYS primarily services three end markets: communications, government, aerospace & defense, and industry, like automotives and semiconductors. While these various product lines are experiencing declines of different magnitudes, Keysight is seeing declines across all units, which is leading to falling revenue.

Just as KEYS is seeing weakness across products, the company is seeing challenges across geography. Keysight is a fairly global business with the Americas driving 41% of sales; Asia Pacific 39%, and Europe 20%. In the Americas, revenue fell by 8% while Asia was down by 13%. Management has specifically called out the fact that China continues to be weak and ""challenging."" Even with recent underperformance here, China is a mid-teens share of revenue.

While China is a clear point of concern, I was also concerned by the performance in Europe. Headline revenue fell by 1%, due to weakness in communications. However, the company has also completed an acquisition of European-based ESI, which will provide $140 million of recurring revenue. Ex-M&A and currency, Europe was down by 21%, a dramatic drop. With much of the global telecom sector facing fierce competition, elevated debt loads, and high dividend payments, cap-ex spending is somewhat constrained, which has reduced demand for KEYS technology, particularly with much of the 5G roll-out having occurred.

The Communication Solutions Group (CSG) is 67% of revenue and posted a 12% decline to $839 million as operating margins compressed by 170tp to 27.0%. The commercial communications environment is cautious, despite growth in AI-related products. Aerospace, defense, and government was down from last year, though orders rose, given increased space and satellite activity.

Its other, smaller unit, Electronic Industrial Solutions (EISG), was down by 5% from a year ago. Delays in fab projects are reducing semiconductor demand. Keysight products are used to help semiconductors quality check and manage production. With expansion projects taking longer to launch, this pushes out revenue. Most notably, Intel has delayed its Ohio factory's completion date as it has taken more time for CHIPs Act funding to be allocated. Similarly, while electric vehicle solutions spending is rising -- there is less spending on products related to actual production. While EVs continue to gain penetration, take-up has been a little slower with Ford having pushed out some EV sales goals, for instance. These developments create a more challenging environment for Keysight.

This decline in activity is also beginning to pressure profit margins even as KEYS has benefitted from easing supply chains and input costs to increase gross margins by 200bp to 67%. Its cost of products fell by about 10.5%, outpacing the decline in revenue. Favorable mix shift has also helped gross margins with core software sales flat from last year while lower-margin hardware declines.

Despite higher gross margins, the company's core operating margin fell by 230bp to 27%, as the firm has lost operating leverage at a lower sales pace. Most notably, R&D spending rose 2% to $232 million and is now 18.4% of revenue from 16.4% last year. With technology rapidly changing, it is imperative to spend adequately on R&D to maintain competitive positioning, meaning some of this spending is really not discretionary.

Indeed, the company plans to maintain R&D spending around current levels, even in the face of weaker revenue, which is pressuring margins. Now in Q1, SG&A also rose by $24 million to $362 million. However, there were $28 million of restructuring and acquisition costs, as the company seeks to streamline operations with the aim of reducing SG&A spending in the low-to mid-single digits. This may still lead to higher SG&A as a share of revenue, but these declines should help to limit margin compression.

One modest positive is that Keysight is one of the few nonfinancial companies that enjoys positive net interest income, running about $4 million a quarter. The company carries $1.75 billion of cash against $1.2 billion of long-term debt. Because cash interest rates are higher today than the fixed yields KEYS issued debt at, its interest revenue actually exceeds its expenses. Its balance sheet is a significant source of strength that provides ample capacity to manage downturns even far more severe than the company is experiencing. Indeed, it still bought back $93 million of stock in Q1.

The current environment has been difficult, and unfortunately, I do not see signs of acceleration. Orders declined to $1.22 billion from $1.3 billion last year. This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of about 0.97x. Core orders fell by 12% from a year ago. With orders running below revenue, that points to weak future demand, which makes sequential revenue growth more difficult. Keysight has a $2.3 billion backlog, which provides about 6 months of revenue. However, I would note that historically just 2% of orders were ""long-term,"" but that figure is now about 8%. In other words, it will take longer for KEYS to convert backlog to revenue, creating the risk of further revenue slippage.

In perhaps another sign of soft demand, inventory rose about $40 million sequentially to $1.02 billion. With inventories higher even as sales, its working capital position is less efficient, and it takes Keysight longer to move product. This does create a risk that recent gross margin gains are reversed. This inventory rise is not substantial to be a major risk, but rather, it is a minor headwind and adds to the evidence demand has undershot expectations.

Along these lines, management isn't ""assuming a strong revenue recovery"" in the second half of the fiscal year. Activity is expected to decelerate further this quarter with revenue expected to be $1.19-$1.21 billion, leading to $1.34-$1.40 in EPS. Management expects revenue to be flat sequentially in Q3 and up mid-single-digits in Q4, which would just get KEYS back to Q1 levels. More optimistically, it expects some increase in orders, creating the potential for revenue growth in 2025, though off such a low base, revenue may not return to peak levels before 2026.

In the first half, KEYS will earn about $3.00, and its guidance implies a similar run-rate in revenues in H2 vs H1. Considering there is a 3-6 month lag between orders and revenue, the ~$1.2 billion in orders is consistent with Q2 guidance and a similar level of revenue in Q3. Given an economic recession appears unlikely, a further material drop should not be the base case. There is scope for modest growth in some segments like government, given the US is raising defense spending by 3%. This should support Keysight sales for satellite and space work. If Boeing (BA) is able to increase production, that would support its aerospace unit, though I hesitate to assume much improvement. All of this points to a second half that is similar to the first half on the revenue front.

Holding margins flat, this would lead to about $3 in EPS in H2 2024. At a 5% reduction in SG&A, earnings could push towards $3.20 as margins improve. As such, I am looking for $6-$6.20 in full year earnings. This puts the $6.15 consensus toward the higher end of my 2024 earnings forecast, creating some downside risk.

I also view earnings as likelier to come in toward $6 than $6.20, as a 5% SG&A cut may prove larger than the company can generate, and R&D spending stays elevated. Additionally, with inventories rising, some gross margin momentum may be lost. Its China business also remains weak, and given the geopolitical dynamics, there may be an effort to diversify away from US technology companies, reducing demand for Keysight products more structurally. While KEYS exposure to China has fallen, a mid-teens share of revenue is still significant; ongoing weakness here just makes it more difficult to grow the company. Analysts are forecasting a 21% growth rate in 2025, which seems optimistic with Q4 revenue unlikely to be much better than Q1 and orders activity that shows little momentum.

Shares are trading 25x 2024 earnings, and over 20x 2025 earnings. This is a lofty multiple for a company seeing negative revenue growth and facing a constrained demand environment that does not appear to be abating. By contrast, the entire S&P 500 is at 20.9x forward earnings and about 18.6x 2025 earnings with consensus of 11% growth in 2024 and 13% in 2025. KEYS is trading at a significant premium to the market even as it has a slower growth profile. While its balance sheet provides Keysight with durability, the ability to grow into these premium multiples is unclear, and the market appears to already be pricing in a recovery, which may not materialize as quickly as hoped.

As such, with shares having rallied (though less than the market), investors have an opportunity to exit shares at an attractive level in my view. Given its strong balance sheet and the fact earnings should bottom this year, I believe a multiple of up to 20x can be justified, or about $125. That creates nearly 20% downside, which may be realized if market lose confidence in such a strong 2025 recovery. I would sell shares before future earnings report shows the weak momentum in the business persists.

On Thursday, the US dollar fell below Rs. 300 for the first time since July 2023, being traded at one point at Rs. 299.29 in the money market.

The reasons are many for the rupee to rise after a prolonged period of pressure from the US dollar in 2022 and 2023, bankers said adding that the Central Bank was regularly buying dollars from the market to stabilise the dollar and prevent it from further sliding against the rupee. ""If not for Central Bank intervention, the dollar may have reached the Rs.270-280 levels,"" said a dealer. In January 2024, the Central Bank bought US$245 million from the money markets and around $280 million last month. ""The Central Bank seems to be buying $10-20 million dollars a day from the market to prevent a sliding dollar vis-à-vis the demand and supply situation in the market,"" he said.

March is the peak season of the year for imports ahead of supplies needed for the New Year but this year that demand was absent. ""By this time, imports should have risen sharply which is not the case today,"" a trader of essential goods said, adding that they have many stocks at hand since traders bought excess stocks before the VAT was increased.

The supply of dollars in the market is more than the demand for imports. Disposable incomes are also falling resulting in less demand for some essentials and white goods (cookers, refrigerators, washing machines, music sets, etc) for which some suppliers are offering special discounted rates to get rid of piled-up stocks.

Migrant workers are also seen as cashing in their foreign currency earnings fast amidst the depreciation of the dollar. Bankers said last year banks had to buy dollars to settle some dollar bonds triggering demand for dollars. ""That pressure is not there now,"" a banker said.

A foreign exchange manager of a local bank said there were many speculators in the market trading on the prospects of a further fall in the dollar.

Tourism revenue more than doubled in January-February 2024 to $687.5 million from $315.1million in the same 2023 months. Gross forex reserves were $4.5 billion at end February.",sundaytimes.lk,news,Times Online Sri Lanka,,0.0117647058823529,448940645,1,,eng-9417406

The upcoming poll will feature a multi-party contest, with the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance and the opposition coalition of the INDIA bloc being the primary contenders. The alliances are built, and major parties have announced their candidates. At the moment, it seems a onehorse race, with the BJP dominating the polls and the opposition parties trailing behind. Prime Minister Modi wants to perform a hat trick and win for the third consecutive time.

The Opposition INDIA alliance comprises 26 parties that have formed a pre-poll alliance to challenge the BJP. The coalition aims to field a single opposition candidate against the BJP in the upcoming elections. The Congress party, leading the INDIA bloc, has suffered two consecutive defeats in 2014 and 2019 and significant damage to its image. One of the party's weaknesses is its over-reliance on past successes and a need for connections with younger generations, including millennials. Congress is a 138-year secular party that used to represent marginalised groups like SCs, STs, OBCs, and Muslims. With the rise of regional satraps, it has been weakened.

The party now claims to be committed to social justice and empowering India's poor, oppressed, Dalits, farmers, youth, and women with its five guarantees: Yuva Nyay, Bhagidaari Nyay, Naari Nyay, Kisan Nyay, and Shramik Nyay. The Opposition, mainly Congress, aims to challenge Modi by consolidating anti-BJP votes and offering incentives. This strategy worked in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana in last year's Assembly polls, which Congress won. Congress hopes to gain from the BJP's anti-incumbency by offering sops and freebies. They also highlight Rahul Gandhi's recent Bharat Jodo Yatras, which were meant to connect with the people. To succeed, Congress must raise bread-and-butter issues such as inflation, joblessness, and social discord to engage with young voters who play a decisive role in many elections.

They must show an alternate strategy to address them. Some powerful chief ministers of state-level parties dominate their states, making it a tough fight for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in these areas. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and its allies secured only 45 per cent of the votes, while the remaining 55 per cent were up for grabs. Although no national leader can match Modi's popularity, some influential regional leaders can sway voters in their respective regions. This is particularly true for West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. The biggest challenge for the INDIA coalition is to project a single leader against Modi. Unfortunately, there is an ego clash among the coalition partners, which makes it difficult to agree on someone. Secondly, the BJP boasts a strong organisation with immense financial and political power.

The Opposition doesn't seem to have a solid and compelling storyline, except for its commitment to safeguarding the Constitution and democratic values. However, most voters are more concerned about basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. For instance, Sonia Gandhi's Aam Aadmi slogan in 2004 resonated well with the masses. Lowincome people generally from live paycheck to paycheck and may not relate to abstract political concepts. The Congress Party is still clinging to its glorious past and failing to acknowledge the current political climate. Congress automatically expects to lead the coalition as the secondlargest party, but other regional leaders with large egos also want to compete with them. It has been losing its leaders to the BJP, and the steady exodus demoralises the cadre.

The Opposition needs a solid counter to BJP's propaganda that they are anti-Hindu. BJP has grown since 1980; today, it is the biggest party in India. It has a strong organisation with unlimited money power. The party seeks votes in the name of the Prime Minister. Thus, the BJP has a better chance of winning this time. The BJP's mascot is Modi. His supporters consider him a proactive leader due to his successful implementation of various measures such as Triple Talaq, CAA, revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, and the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The BJP highlights its achievements in the last decade and various welfare initiatives to attract other voters.

The continuity has helped Modi achieve his agenda for the past ten years. Modi has gained international recognition over the past ten years, and India's position at the high table excites his supporters. The Opposition has accused Modi of being an authoritarian leader who is toppling opposition governments in different states. Additionally, the Modi government is accused of harassing opposition leaders. Yet another allegation is that the BJP poaches on other parties, lawmakers, and leaders.

It has absorbed many second-rung leaders who chose to find better prospects in the saffron party. The 2024 elections will see a high-pitch campaign, as this will decide the future of the Opposition and the BJP. The secret to Modi's success was a divided opposition. As long as this continues, Modi will continue to win.",thestatesman.com,news,The Statesman,,0.1450980392156862,448940488,1,https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/statesman-logo-default-pic.jpg,

The state govt has also ordered serving of showcause notice to forest department officials who had earlier recommended the project, overlooking destruction of large tracts of forested areas in the Ghats. Planning to light up parts of South Goa by sourcing power from Tamnar in Chhattisgarh, GTTPL had sought permission from Karnataka to divert a whopping 174.6 hectares of forest land, including the Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR), to lay a 400 kV transmission line.

Over 72k trees were on chopping block

While the user agency was yet to get a clearance from the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), GTTPL sought permission from Karnataka to lay the transmission line through state forests.

Based on the Central Electricity Authority's proposal to execute an additional 400 kV feed to Goa, GTTPL had reportedly planned the transmission line from Narendra village, near Dharwad in Karnataka, by tapping the existing 400 kV Narendra line of the Power Grid Corporation of India, linking the 400/200 kV substation at Xeldom in Goa.

The transmission line was aligned to pass through three Karnataka districts - Dharwad, Belagavi and Uttara Kannada - before reaching south Goa.

The user agency had also submitted to take up afforestation in nine villages of Belagavi, Dharwad and Uttara Kannada on 360 hectares of degraded forest land.

After the initial objection to the proposed alignment, GTTPL authorities had submitted realignment of the transmission line to avoid taking it through dense forests. Moreover, the alignment cleared by the forest department required clearing out of more than 72,000 trees in four forest divisions, including the Dandeli wildlife division.

Surprisingly, the deputy conservator of forests from Dharwad, Haliyal and Dandeli had recommended the diversion proposal, while their counterpart from Belagavi rejected it.

While the conservator of forests (Canara Circle) and chief conservator of forests (Dharwad) had recommended it, CCF Belagavi had rejected the proposal citing ecological destruction.

Based on the ground officer's opinion, PCCF (HoFF) submitted the proposal to ACS, forest department, for consideration under the Forest Act 1980 for diversion of 174.65 hectares of forest. However, ACS forest department, in consultation with Karnataka forest minister Eshwar Khandre, rejected the proposal and directed the user agency to lay the transmission line through non-forested landscape.

In a stern letter to the forest department dated March 16, 2024, a copy of which was accessed by STOI, the ACS directed: ""Henceforth, the department shall take very strict action on projects like these in the larger interests of forest, environment and wildlife conservation for the future generation.""

Commenting on the issue, wildlife conservationist Giridhar Kulkarni said: ""It is indeed a positive development and goes in the larger interest of wildlife conservation in the districts of Belagavi and Uttara Kannada. I had submitted multiple representations to the authorities to reject the previous as well as the revised proposal."" He further said: ""We thank forest minister Eshwar Khandre for taking such a bold decision to save the precious Western Ghats from rapacious development.""",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Niranjan Kaggere,-0.1843137254901961,448940418,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108742398,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.",fox10tv.com,news,FOX10 News,,-0.05882352941176472,448939620,1,https://gray-wala-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/6E67Z3U7L3F3WDZSDG5QU32SMQ.jpg?auth=a60edb887a2d39c029af1f593cadc5a0b79773578f8c02a302972bbfa38c84ab&width=1200&height=600&smart=true,

The following article, written by Christopher Palma, Penn State originally appeared on The Conversation and is published here with permission:

On April 8, 2024, millions across the U.S. will have the once-in-a-lifetime chance to view a total solar eclipse. Cities including Austin, Texas; Buffalo, New York; and Cleveland, Ohio, will have a direct view of this rare cosmic event that lasts for just a few hours.

While you can see many astronomical events, such as comets and meteor showers, from anywhere on Earth, eclipses are different. You need to travel to what's called the path of totality to experience the full eclipse. Only certain places get an eclipse's full show, and that's because of scale.

The relatively small size of the Moon and its shadow make eclipses truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. On average, total solar eclipses are visible somewhere on Earth once every few years. But from any one location on Earth, it is roughly 375 years between solar eclipses.

I'm an astronomer, but I have never seen a total solar eclipse, so I plan to drive to Erie, Pennsylvania, in the path of totality, for this one. This is one of the few chances I have to see a total eclipse without making a much more expensive trip to someplace more remote. Many people have asked me why nearby eclipses are so rare, and the answer is related to the size of the Moon and its distance from the Sun.

Size and scale

You can observe a solar eclipse when the Moon passes in front of the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun from view. For people on Earth to be able to see an eclipse, the Moon, while orbiting around the Earth, must lie exactly along the observer's line of sight with the Sun. Only some observers will see an eclipse, though, because not everyone's view of the Sun will be blocked by the Moon on the day of an eclipse.

The fact that solar eclipses happen at all is a bit of a numerical coincidence. It just so happens that the Sun is approximately 400 times larger than the Moon and also 400 times more distant from the Earth.

So, even though the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is just close enough to Earth to appear the same size as the Sun when seen from Earth.

For example, your pinky finger is much, much smaller than the Sun, but if you hold it up at arm's length, it appears to your eye to be large enough to block out the Sun. The Moon can do the same thing - it can block out the Sun if it's lined up perfectly with the Sun from your point of view.

Path of totality

When the Earth, Moon and Sun line up perfectly, the Moon casts a shadow onto the Earth. Since the Moon is round, its shadow is round as it lands on Earth. The only people who see the eclipse are those in the area on Earth where the shadow lands at a given moment.

The Moon is continuously orbiting around the Earth, so as time goes on during the eclipse, the Moon's shadow moves over the face of the Earth. Its shadow ends up looking like a thick line that can cover hundreds of miles in length. Astronomers call that line the path of totality.

From any given location along the path of totality, an observer can see the Sun completely eclipsed for a few minutes. Then, the shadow moves away from that location and the Sun slowly becomes more and more visible.

A tilted orbit

Solar eclipses don't happen every single time the Moon passes in between Earth and the Sun. If that were the case, there would be a solar eclipse every month.

If you could float above the Earth's North Pole and see the Moon's orbit from above, you would see the Moon line up with the Sun once every time it orbits around the Earth, which is approximately once per month. From this high point of view, it looks like the Moon's shadow should land on Earth every orbit.

However, if you could shift your perspective to look at the Moon's orbit from the orbital plane, you would see that the Moon's orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees compared with Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt means that sometimes the Moon is too high and its shadow passes above the Earth, and sometimes the Moon is too low and its shadow passes below the Earth. An eclipse happens only when the Moon is positioned just right and its shadow lands on the Earth.

As time goes on, the Earth and the Moon continue spinning, and eventually the Moon aligns with Earth's orbit around the Sun at the same moment the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth.

While only certain cities are in the path of totality for this April's eclipse, the entire U.S. is still close enough to this path that observers outside of the path of totality will see a partial eclipse. In those locations, the Moon will appear to pass in front of part of the Sun, leaving a crescent shape of the Sun still visible at the moment of maximum eclipse.

Madison Durflinger knew she wanted a career working with animals while growing up on a farm near Eldon in southeast Iowa.

""We had a small cow-calf operation along with row crops,"" she says. ""That really sparked my interest in veterinary medicine.""

Durflinger graduated from Iowa State University's College of Veterinary Medicine in 2023 and started working at the Stuart Veterinary Clinic in Stuart, Iowa.

Prior to entering vet school, Durflinger received her bachelor's degrees in biology and animal science at Iowa State.

""I visited a lot of clinics around the Midwest, and it was really cool to see how they were all somehow different,"" she says. ""The clinic in Stuart really matched what I wanted in a practice. It's been a great opportunity.""

While Durflinger works with animals of all sizes, most of her emphasis at Iowa State came with large animals, especially hogs.

The vet school encourages students to recognize the opportunities out there for large animal veterinarians, says Justin Brown, assistant professor of swine production medicine at ISU.

""There is still definitely a shortage of vets working with food animals,"" he says. ""We also see shortages out in the rural areas. A lot of residents do not have access to a local veterinarian.""

Brown says Iowa State uses an all-around approach to help train veterinarians.

Not only are they well-versed in production medicine, but they understand the role of a veterinarian in their local community.

""There is a lot of value to having a veterinarian in a small community,"" he says. ""For the most part, veterinarians are pretty active members of their communities, and we want our students to realize that.""

Brown says there are several programs offering incentives to students looking to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.

He says ISU will work with students interested in these programs to find a fit for them.

That can include being a part of the Army Veterinary Corps, where the Army pays for vet school in exchange for several years of service.

Brown says other universities offer similar incentives and programs.

""USDA offer some loan-forgiveness programs in exchange for practicing in a certain area,"" Brown says, adding the USDA is usually looking to hire veterinarians for food safety and other purposes.

Durflinger says she appreciates the opportunities she has and encourages anyone interested in a career in veterinary medicine to talk to veterinarians and visit practices to see what they have to offer.

""Iowa State did a really good job of preparing us and to help us out when we needed it,"" she says.

Durflinger says she is enjoying working in Stuart and enjoys meeting new people.

""They have been very welcoming here,"" she says. ""I'm happy that I can work with both large and small animals. I enjoy the variety.""

In November 2023, Tynan made his ONE Championship debut against Kang Ji Won at ONE Fight Night 16. 'Vanilla Thunder' dominated with his superior grappling skills before putting the heavyweight division on notice by submitting Ji Won in round three.

On April 5, the 30-year-old Canadian will return for his second promotional fight at ONE Fight Night 21, which takes place inside the iconic Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Bangkok, Thailand. Tynan's latest test is Didier, who is coming off a split-decision defeat against Jasur Mirzamukhamedov.

Ben Tynan recently did an interview with ONE and had this to say about his upcoming opponent:

""He seems like he's a decent grappler. He's got something of a clinch, I'll give him that. That looks decent enough, but besides that, I don't know. I don't want to be too cocky, but I think I'm going to take this guy's head off.""

ONE Fight Night 21 will air live on US primetime free of charge for existing Prime Video subscribers in North America.

Who else is fighting at ONE Fight Night 21 besides Ben Tynan?

Ben Tynan's return isn't the only reason to watch ONE Fight Night 21 on April 5. In the main event, Regian Eersel looks to defend his ONE lightweight kickboxing world title. To do so, the two-sport king must get through promotional newcomer Alexis Nicolas, who holds an undefeated lifetime record of 23-0.

As for the co-main event, Tye Ruotolo plans to defend his ONE welterweight submission grappling world title for the first time. Standing in Ruotolo's way is promotional newcomer Izaak Michell, who trains under the legendary John Danaher.

After the reveal of Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis, several celebrities and netizens have been backtracking on the jokes made about the princess's hypothetical condition when she was allegedly missing.

Several others on the internet have taken the opportunity to call out the people who made the jokes for their apparent lack of empathy for the princess. Among those is Leah McSweeney, who also has an ongoing lawsuit against Andy Cohen.

Leah McSweeney has also filed a lawsuit against Andy Cohen before the Kate Middleton conflict

After a video was revealed of Prince William and Princess Catherine walking at a farm stand in Windsor, many people, including Andy, expressed apprehension and disbelief, refusing to believe that it was the real Kate Middleton.

Many had claimed it was a doppelganger or yet another edit. Cohen had shared the post, with the comment,

""That ain't Kate...""

Andy Cohen has also made repeated mentions of the rumors of infidelity between Prince William and Kate Middleton on his podcast, prior to Middleton's shocking announcement.

Leah McSweeney turned to Instagram stories to call out Cohen, claiming he loves viciously going after women, and asked him to apologize.

On Friday, she posted:

""Andy Cohen gets a kick out of being cruel to women and Kate Middleton is no exception,""

She finished by calling on people in power to practice better leadership.

""I hope that after she was forced to publicly talk about her cancer diagnosis he will muster up the decency to apologize to her. People with power need to lead by example.""

Leah McSweeney has been a vocal supporter of Kate Middleton, ever since the beginning of the social media turmoil.

She had posted a picture of the princess on Instagram, with the caption:

""Please leave this woman alone everybody. Yes she is a princess but she's also a human being. Have we not learned anything by now? Has social media destroyed empathy? The amount of jokes, and gossip about someone who is dealing with a medical situation and wants privacy Regardless of their nature of celebrity is so disheartening. I hope she gets well soon.""

McSweeney and Cohen are also involved in a lawsuit. The Real Housewives star filed a suit last month, alleging that Cohen likes to snort cocaine with some of the ""Housewives"" stars.

She also claims that he's tried to exploit her substance issues and mental health struggles in an attempt to drive up ratings.

Andy Cohen has denied all claims and has called the lawsuit a ""shakedown,"" claiming that McSweeney is trying to ""force an unjustified settlement""

Cohen is just one of many celebrities to find themselves in hot waters after the Princess of Wales' cancer announcement. Blake Lively apologized for cracking a joke about Middleton's photoshopped family picture.

If an asset is outlandishly priced - say, gold was suddenly $10 an ounce - everyone would immediately know that something is seriously wrong. While some will try to take advantage of this, the market would rapidly reverse and the price would shoot upwards towards ""normalcy"". That's the nature of markets, which run in cycles.

Indeed, everything runs in cycles, including politics. And if something as outlandish as 10-dollar gold were to happen in the world of politics, it would be a definitive signal that the existing ""ism"" is either already or on the way to being changed.

The last turning point in the global political cycle was in 2008 when years of liberalism ended with an African-American man in the White House (in a patently racist country). That cycle began about 20 years earlier (in the late 1980s) when the Reagan/Thatcher juggernaut of conservatism was in full flow. And here we are already 16 years from 2008 with populism in full flow and something even more outlandish than 10-dollar gold shaking up the world of politics. [Drum roll] ...I give you, the Pope of Populism, Donald Trump!

That someone as grotesque as Trump was actually president of the most powerful country on earth and has a reasonable chance of being re-elected is, to my mind, a signal that the wave of populism that has been plaguing the world for the nearly two decades or so has not disappeared but is peaking. It can't get worse from now on and is perhaps on its last legs.

As evidence, there are many straws in the wind. Look, for instance, at the recent travails of Viktor Orban, Hungary's populist prime minister and supreme leader since 2010. The proximate cause of his problem was the discovery that a former official convicted of covering up sexual crimes at a state-run children's home had been granted clemency by the President, who, together with two senior figures in Orban's ruling party, have been compelled to resign. Given Orban's loud preaching of conservative values - same sex marriage is banned and civil rights of LGBTQ+ Hungarians are constrained - as part of his agenda, the hypocrisy stands out like a rotten egg on his sour face.

Tens of thousands of ordinary Hungarians gathered in Budapest in the largest protest against Orban in recent years. To be sure, with almost complete control of most media outlets, he remains popular despite high inflation, low growth, and severe rural poverty. However, corruption is pervasive and, while elections are still two years away, the mood appears to be changing. This is what Reuters reported:

""We have had enough. We need change, this government is full of lies and hypocrisy,"" said Jozsef Molnar, 64, who added that his 19-year-old son was also out protesting. Molnar said the last time he went to a protest was in 1989 during the time when communism collapsed.

In addition to his domestic woes, Orban has steadily alienated most other members of the EU over his close relationship with Putin, another populist who is beginning to stagger under the weight of his expansionary ambitions. The fact that he (Putin) had to have his main political opponent, Navalny, allegedly killed in prison - as seems most likely - just a month before the presidential election speaks to his nervousness and/or irrationality. The ""murder"" has triggered the most serious protests in Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, confirming that Putin's authoritarianism, too, is beginning to fray, although, horrifyingly, people are being killed every day because of him.

And then, of course, there's Netanyahu. While most Israelis feel the war against Hamas is justified, even more of them realise that the moment the war is over (and perhaps sooner), Netanyahu is finished. In Israel, the families of hostages are rapidly losing patience as are Israel's till-now staunchest ally, America. Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader of the Senate and the first Jewish Majority Leader in the US, has called on Israel to hold new elections, saying he believes Netanyahu has lost his way and is an obstacle to peace. It couldn't be more clear that Netanyahu's number is up; it's tragic that he is prolonging this genocide against Palestinians simply to cling to power.

These are pretty egregious examples - particularly, Putin and Netanyahu, who will each be awarded a vicious and bloody end - but a much wider spectrum of leaders, populist or otherwise, are already feeling the pressure. Farmers are protesting all over the EU, in India, and in several countries from the heretofore Soviet bloc; in some of these (Czech Republic, Poland), the protests have been the largest since the fall of communism. It is clear that people in most countries, particularly in the West, are hugely dissatisfied with the way things are going, even without considering the horrific wars that are burning the globe. Clearly, things are going to change.

Change takes time. But the good news is that more and more people are now able to see that populist leaders, who target outsiders (minorities, immigrants), control the media, and brandish authoritarianism, rapidly build a new elite once they come to power with ordinary people getting short shrift in terms of any real benefits.

Till very recently, India seemed to be an exception in that, even though Modi fits the populist definition to a T, there haven't yet been any earth-shaking waves of dissent. However, the recent disclosure (as a result of the Supreme Court order on Electoral Bonds) that the BJP has been trying to institutionalise crony capitalism has put paid to Modi's ""na khaunga na khane dunga"" credentials. This, together with the fact that ongoing price rises are steadily pushing living standards down for most people, suggests that despite the huge money/media/organisational power the BJP wields, the future of India as a ""Hindu rashtra"" is most definitely not assured.

Zooming out to the global picture, with Trump remaining loudly in the news, whether as the next President of the US or as a contentious revolutionary tilting at the windmills of the US political system, people across the globe (including India) will be continuously reminded, particularly when they feel the pressure on their wallets, of the foolishness of mistaking a media circus for genuine governance.

Municipal energy supplier Westfalen Weser has announced plans to develop a 120 MW/280 MWh battery energy storage system at a former nuclear power plant site in Würgassen, North Rhine-Westphalia. As the utility said this week, the town of Beverungen has handed over the land to Westfalen Weser.

The 1,912 MW Würgassen nuclear power plant was operated by PreussenElektra, both prior to and during decommissioning. Commercial operations began in 1975. The plant was shut down in 1994, after which all fuel elements were removed.

Just like decommissioned coal power plants, retired nuclear reactors are attractive locations for the development of grid-scale battery energy storage systems. They offer the opportunity to reuse existing infrastructure and grid interconnection rights.

Westfalen Weser has confirmed this, saying that the retired Würgassen plant is particularly suitable for a battery storage facility because it has the needed infrastructure in place, including a transformer station and corresponding lines. The facility is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2026, with investments totaling around €92 million ($99.6 million).

Such a summit would have been unthinkable a dozen years ago in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, but a warming planet creating a need to phase out fossil fuels and war in Ukraine laying bare a dependence on Russian energy have turned the tables over the past half decade.

""We have to do everything possible to to facilitate the contribution of nuclear energy,"" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. ""It is clear: Nuclear is there. It has an important role to play,"" he said.

The one-day meeting is held next to the 1958 Atomium, the 102-meter (335-foot) -tall construction of the nine iron atoms, which sought to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the wake of the nuclear bomb explosions at the end of World War II and their use as a geopolitical deterrent ever since.

Nuclear energy, said European Union Council President Charles Michel, ""can help us to tackle the climate crisis on the one hand, and it can help us to build our strategic autonomy.""

The devastating impact of a nuclear accident, like the 1986 one in Chernobyl, Ukraine, was barely a talking point at the meeting. Outside environmental groups sought to highlight the dangers of the technology and convince leaders that renewable energy sources like wind and sun were much more practical and worthwhile.

Building nuclear plants takes many years and projects are often marred by cost and deadline overruns.

The following article, written by Christopher Palma, Penn State originally appeared on The Conversation and is published here with permission:

On April 8, 2024, millions across the U.S. will have the once-in-a-lifetime chance to view a total solar eclipse. Cities including Austin, Texas; Buffalo, New York; and Cleveland, Ohio, will have a direct view of this rare cosmic event that lasts for just a few hours.

While you can see many astronomical events, such as comets and meteor showers, from anywhere on Earth, eclipses are different. You need to travel to what's called the path of totality to experience the full eclipse. Only certain places get an eclipse's full show, and that's because of scale.

The relatively small size of the Moon and its shadow make eclipses truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. On average, total solar eclipses are visible somewhere on Earth once every few years. But from any one location on Earth, it is roughly 375 years between solar eclipses.

I'm an astronomer, but I have never seen a total solar eclipse, so I plan to drive to Erie, Pennsylvania, in the path of totality, for this one. This is one of the few chances I have to see a total eclipse without making a much more expensive trip to someplace more remote. Many people have asked me why nearby eclipses are so rare, and the answer is related to the size of the Moon and its distance from the Sun.

Size and scale

You can observe a solar eclipse when the Moon passes in front of the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun from view. For people on Earth to be able to see an eclipse, the Moon, while orbiting around the Earth, must lie exactly along the observer's line of sight with the Sun. Only some observers will see an eclipse, though, because not everyone's view of the Sun will be blocked by the Moon on the day of an eclipse.

The fact that solar eclipses happen at all is a bit of a numerical coincidence. It just so happens that the Sun is approximately 400 times larger than the Moon and also 400 times more distant from the Earth.

So, even though the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is just close enough to Earth to appear the same size as the Sun when seen from Earth.

For example, your pinky finger is much, much smaller than the Sun, but if you hold it up at arm's length, it appears to your eye to be large enough to block out the Sun. The Moon can do the same thing - it can block out the Sun if it's lined up perfectly with the Sun from your point of view.

Path of totality

When the Earth, Moon and Sun line up perfectly, the Moon casts a shadow onto the Earth. Since the Moon is round, its shadow is round as it lands on Earth. The only people who see the eclipse are those in the area on Earth where the shadow lands at a given moment.

The Moon is continuously orbiting around the Earth, so as time goes on during the eclipse, the Moon's shadow moves over the face of the Earth. Its shadow ends up looking like a thick line that can cover hundreds of miles in length. Astronomers call that line the path of totality.

From any given location along the path of totality, an observer can see the Sun completely eclipsed for a few minutes. Then, the shadow moves away from that location and the Sun slowly becomes more and more visible.

A tilted orbit

Solar eclipses don't happen every single time the Moon passes in between Earth and the Sun. If that were the case, there would be a solar eclipse every month.

If you could float above the Earth's North Pole and see the Moon's orbit from above, you would see the Moon line up with the Sun once every time it orbits around the Earth, which is approximately once per month. From this high point of view, it looks like the Moon's shadow should land on Earth every orbit.

However, if you could shift your perspective to look at the Moon's orbit from the orbital plane, you would see that the Moon's orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees compared with Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt means that sometimes the Moon is too high and its shadow passes above the Earth, and sometimes the Moon is too low and its shadow passes below the Earth. An eclipse happens only when the Moon is positioned just right and its shadow lands on the Earth.

As time goes on, the Earth and the Moon continue spinning, and eventually the Moon aligns with Earth's orbit around the Sun at the same moment the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth.

While only certain cities are in the path of totality for this April's eclipse, the entire U.S. is still close enough to this path that observers outside of the path of totality will see a partial eclipse. In those locations, the Moon will appear to pass in front of part of the Sun, leaving a crescent shape of the Sun still visible at the moment of maximum eclipse.

NASA said on April 8, during the course of about an hour, darkness will fall on impacted areas when the Moon moves fully in front of the Sun, with the Sun's corona shining around the edge. Outside of that path of totality, people in other parts of the U.S. will experience a partial solar eclipse.

NASA has linked on its website safe ways to view the eclipse while protecting your vision. NASA says, ""Viewing any part of the bright Sun through a camera lens, binoculars, or a telescope without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics will instantly cause severe eye injury.""

In Oklahoma, the state is preparing for an influx of visitors after promoting how the state will be in an area with a good view of the solar eclipse. Members of the state's National Guard will be activated to help manage as local emergency responders assist any citizens in need.

NASA has an interactive map on its website that shows the path where viewers on the ground will be able to see the solar eclipse in totality.

Various opinion poll forecast Trump's returning as President of USA. A wave of trepidation looms on Trump's new approach to the world, besieged by protectionism.

A powerful coterie of Trump supporters are vying to transform USA into a protectionist state. ""America First "" could be ethos of Trump's New America policy. Trump, unlike his predecessors, will demit USA policy for the world to benefit. He is asserted to impose a 10 percent tariff on all imports and 60 percent on China.

Should India shift gears accordingly or resort to retaliation?

In his first term, Mr Trump was averse to WTO multilateral rules. Instead, he focused on bilateral trade and investment deals with countries. He was assertive for abandoning USA's security pact with Japan.

His coming back in power portrays a resurgence of global tariff wars. India is no exception. It is said that first he will impose a 10 percent tariff on all imports and spike duties on such products, which hurt US industries most.

The USA has been the largest trading partner of India, followed by China. Trade with USA is more favourable for India than China. This is because, unlike China, trade with the USA is characterized by India exporting more and importing less from USA.

This demonstrates the USA's key role in India's external economy. Besides being largest trading partner, the USA also plays a lead role in India's foreign investment. This means it also plays an important role in India's domestic economy.

In 2022-23, USA accounted for 17.4 percent of India's world exports. India exported mainly four products groups to the USA. They were diamonds and jewelry, apparels and textile, oil refinery products and pharmaceuticals. Together, they accounted for 40.3 percent of India's total exports to USA in 2022-23.

If Trump imposes a 10 percent import tariff, imports of these 4 products groups are likely to be affected. Nevertheless, the magnitude of impact depends upon the strength of competitors in the US market.

The biggest product group of India's export basket to USA is diamond and jewelry. It accounted for nearly 16 percent of India's total export in 2022-23. India is the top exporter of diamond and jewelry to USA , followed by Israel and Belgium. Apparently, import tariff should impact India's export of diamond and jewelry, due to imposition of import tariffs.

But, there is a catch. India has an edge over its competitors. It is the largest cutting and polishing centre of rough diamond in the world, owing to its special skills of artisans. US bridals prefer for customize design of India, which will outsmart its competitors like Israel and Belgium.

Apparels and textile is another major product group in the basket of exports to USA. Besides trade importance, its exports conceded large benefits to SMEs to flourish and generate employment opportunities in India. India is 3 biggest exporter of apparels and textile to USA, after China and Vietnam.

Since China will be subject to 60 percent import tariff, virtually Vietnam will be a tough competitor to India. Nevertheless, there is a space for India to edge Vietnam. Most of the inputs for apparels and textiles in Vietnam come from China. In contrast, India procures inputs domestically.

During the previous era of Trump tariff war ( January 2017 to January 2020) , India faced high import tariff on aluminum and steel. It was withdrawn from the benefits of GSP scheme( Generalized Scheme of Preference). This left a major impact on India's export growth to USA.

Export to USA plummeted . It led to a fall in exports by 2.76 percent in 2020 -21 , against growth by 1.30 percent in 2019-20 and 13.42 percent in 2017-18.

The major products, whose exports were affected, were oil refinery products, apparels and textiles, diamonds and jewelry and mechanical machinery.

Given this, should India resort to retaliation or reconciliation to mitigate Trump's tariff war, which is likely to be inducted if Trump comes in power.

The USA is the largest trading partner of India. Its role in India's external economy is more important than other major trading partners, given the fact that USA is the biggest export destination for India.

In comparison, India is of meager importance to USA's trade . It accounted for 2.3 percent of USA's total exports and 2.6 percent of USA's total imports in 2021. Eventually, any retaliation by India will have seamless impact on USA's global trade.

To this end , India should resort to quid pro quo . USA is a major foreign investor in India. It is the 3 biggest foreign investor. The significance of US investment is that it parted a key role in transforming industrialization in India and paved the way for India to bid challenge to China for next generation supply chain hub.

Apple's shifting of iPhone to India from China, along with Foxconn's massive investment are the cases in point. USA is likely to emerge frontrunner to set up India's first semiconductor device plant. Micron, USA is on the work to set up the plant. This bodes well for India to be the prime challenger to China for supply chain.

With just under four months until the historic boxing bout on July 20, both Paul and Tyson continue to promote their highly-criticized fight on social media. Paul sent the latest message to his opponent on his show BS w/ Jake Paul, claiming he is counting down the days until he faces his 'toughest opponent' to date.

Paul said:

""Mike, I really want to see, bro. Because you're 'Iron Mike' Tyson but I have an iron chin. People know that I take shots. I think people are underestimating me being able to deal with his power...

Several Ukrainian regions suffered power outages after the largest missile and drone attack on the country's energy infrastructure since the start of the Russia's invasion in 2022, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to again urge foreign allies to accelerate military aid.

""This was, probably, the largest attack of all time against Ukraine's energy system,"" national grid operator Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said on local TV.

In a statement, Russia's defense ministry said its forces had made ""a massive strike against facilities of the energy sector, the military-industrial complex, railway hubs, arsenals"" and locations where Ukrainian troop formations and ""foreign mercenaries"" were stationed.

Certain ""foreign military equipment"" delivered to Ukraine by NATO countries had been also destroyed and transfers of equipment to the front lines disrupted, according to the ministry.

Power supply has been deliberately limited in some regions in order to avoid overloading the non-damaged parts of the grid, according to the grid chief.

Ukraine's air defense intercepted less than half of the 88 missiles, which affected electricity generation and transmission systems across the country early Friday, Zelenskiy said on his Telegram channel. Most of an estimated 63 drones were taken down.

Moscow's goal is to disable Ukraine's power system via the same means as last year, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in an emailed statement.

""Russia's missiles are not facing delays like military aid packages to our state. Shahed drones don't have indecision like some politicians,"" Zelenskiy said as he urged Ukraine's allies not to delay with providing weapons, which will in turn help protect citizens.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, was left almost completely without power after more than 15 strikes on energy facilities, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram. Nearly 700,000 households were without electricity.

Critical infrastructure was also hit in Vinnytsya and Lviv regions and in Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia, according to statements by regional governors.

At least two people were killed and eight wounded in the western city of Khmelnytskyi and another two in Ivano-Frankivsk in the attacks, the Interior Ministry said. Six people were injured and three are missing in Zaporizhzhia, where missiles struck a residential neighborhood. Recovery efforts continue.

One of the remaining power lines that link the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to the Ukrainian power grid automatically switched off because of disruptions in transmission, the nuclear operator Energoatom said on Telegram. The link was restored after five hours, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on X, formerly Twitter.

The Dnipro hydro power plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's largest, was also targeted, causing a fire and destroying one of the dam's supports, Ukrhydroenergo CEO Ihor Syrota, whose state-owned company operated all hydro-electric facilities in Ukraine, said in a video interview to Radio Liberty. The plant's generating capacity has been seriously damaged, but there's no immediate risk of flooding, he said.

Thermal power plants run by the energy producer DTEK were seriously damaged, the company said in a statement. State-run Naftogaz said some of its equipment was damaged.

Ukrainian Railway reported that several areas of its network lost power and trains were being sent on roundabout routes.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram there was no need for emergency power cuts from the strikes.

EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson is convening an urgent meeting of ministers in the international Advisory Council for Ukraine in response to the overnight attacks, according to an EU official. The council includes several EU member states, Canada, Japan, UK, U.S. and representatives of the International Energy Agency and the energy community.

Friday's missile and drone strikes came a day after Kremlin forces targeted Kyiv with at least 31 missiles, the first large-scale attack on Ukraine's capital since February, and less than a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin was re-elected.

The barrage directed at Kyiv included 29 cruise missiles and two ballistic rockets, Ukrainian Air Forces commander Mykola Oleshchuk said Thursday on Telegram.

Exactly full at 3:00 a.m. EDT Monday, March 25, the Full Worm Moon, the first Full Moon of Spring, will undergo a penumbral lunar eclipse in the early morning hours of March 25. This is a celestial prelude to the BIG event just two weeks later, the eclipse of the Sun by the NEW Moon on April 8.

Here are the details of this challenging-to-see shading of the Moon as provided by space.com:

Try using binoculars or a telescope to see the eclipse at maximum. You can try photographing the Moon with your Smartphone or camera.

Keep those binoculars and camera gear handy for the following two sky events, which each require a clear view of the Western horizon free of tall trees and buildings.

On the 24th, watch the Moon rise at sunset in the East and do an about-face 180 degrees to the West to try and see the elusive planet Mercury. Today marks its highest point in the sky this year for Northern Hemisphere observers. Use the bright planet Jupiter, easily visible in the West, as a guidepost. Just look to the lower right, about two fist-widths held at arm's length. Mercury will look like a fairly bright yellowish-golden ""star.""

To round out our sky viewing pleasure, there is a difficult-to-see comet low on the West-Northwestern horizon after sunset. Comet 12P/ Pons-Brooks has been brightening and undergoing sporadic outbursts that temporarily increased its brightness which earned it the nickname ""Devil Comet."" The comet will be near Jupiter during totality on April 8 and quite possibly visible. Only time will tell, as comets are just like cats -- who knows what they will do.

How state pollution board will intensify monitoring

In a bid to intensify its efforts to monitor air quality in the city and curb industrial emissions, the will be procuring additional equipment and upgrading its laboratories.

Taking into account the rise in industrial pollution, the has devised the plan to procure the specialised equipment and upgrade the existing labs to meet the requirements.

In this regard, the state pollution board floated a tender for the aforesaid procurement of field equipment so as to intensify its efforts to rein in industrial emissions and supply additional lab equipment for upgrading its air testing laboratory.

As per the tender, apart from procuring devices such as particulate matter sampler for PM10 with calibrator, particulate matter sampler for PM2.5 with calibrator, portable VOC analyser, stack monitoring kit with glass probe and heat holder, the KSPCB is also planning to set up 15 weather monitoring stations. To upgrade the lab equipment, KSPCB is procuring about 13 pieces of lab equipment.

Using the equipment and upgraded lab, the board will be able to monitor PM10, PM2.5 & gaseous emissions emanating from industries.

As part of the tender, the agency will be responsible for the installation of each equipment and demonstration of the functioning of equipment at the respective office and at the identified site in the field, delivery of equipment, providing consumable spares for ten years, providing required training to the identified staff, officers as desired free of cost, of equipment once a year and so on.

According to the KSPCB, there are 17 categories of industries in Karnataka; it has categorised industrial sectors into four categories based on the pollution index as per directions issued by the . They are: Red: Industrial sectors that have pollution index score of 60 and above, Orange: Industrial sectors with pollution index score of 41 to 59, Green: Industrial sectors with pollution index score of 21 to 40, and White: Industrial sectors with pollution index score up to 20.

According to the CPCB, the Index (CEPI) score assessment can be used as a warning tool by state governments to understand the severity of the pollution and take action. The state government and state pollution control board can formulate action plans within three months for severely polluted and critically . The action plan involves setting up continuous air quality monitoring stations, water quality monitoring stations, and so forth.

The district and state-level monitoring committees are required to oversee the implementation of the action plan and ensure there is no delay. In case of delay, the state government can take action against the concerned authorities. It is mandatory to publish the CEPI scores, progress reports of committee meetings and environmental quality data in the public domain.",bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com,news,Bangalore Mirror,,0.1058823529411765,448937371,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-52452,msid-108738508/108738508.jpg",

On Friday, March 22m 2024, the demand for electricity on the island of San Pedro surpassed the power capacity of the submarine cable that connects San Pedro to the national grid. Hot and humid weather conditions and the activities leading up to and through the Easter weekend are expected to place further strain on the capacity of the electricity supply on the island.

To alleviate the capcity constrains on the island, BEL is working arduously on deployong a mobile gas turbine in the vicinity of the port that is expected to be commissioned by the end of May 2024. This facility will serve as a temporary solution to address the growing energy needs of our customers in San Pedro and to facilitate urgent maintenance that has to be carried out on the subamrine cable.

Additionally, BEL and the Government are working together to set up a battery energy storage solution on BEL's property on the island. This is expected to come online in 2025 and will provide further capacity support during periods of high demand.

The long-term solution for San Pedro is the installation of a second submarine cable from the mainland to the northern portion of the island, which will be rated at around three times the capacity of the existing submarine cable and will be able to supply the energy needs of the island for many years to come. Once this is installed and commissioned, the mobile gas turbine will be moved to the mainland.

We thank our customers in San Pedro and the public who rely on our services for their understanding and cooperation as we continue to make every effort to deliver safe, reliable, and sustainable electricity services and energy solutions to you.",sanpedrosun.com,news,The San Pedro Sun,Janelle Cowo,0.2549019607843137,448937368,23,https://cdn.sanpedrosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23184029/Belize-Electricity-Limited-Monitors-Unprecedented-Power-Demand-in-San-Pedro.jpg,

Texas A&M won 98-83.

Travis L. Brown

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Texas A&M forward Solomon Washington spewed venom toward anyone in range of his voice as he walked back to the Aggie huddle during a second-half timeout Friday night.

Seconds earlier, the 6-foot-7 post launched his body in the air, arm stretched a mile above his head and swatted down a shot attempted by Nebraska's Jamarques Lawrence beyond the 3-point line. Washington secured the defensive rebound with his arms wrapped around Lawrence's body before hitting Henry Coleman III in transition. Guard Jace Carter finished the play with an easy layup, pushing the Aggies (21-14) to a 21-point lead en route to a 98-83 victory.

""I'm not [SEC] all-defensive team?"" Washington could be heard screaming into the void as he made his way into the Aggie timeout.

Emotion has always driven Washington's game, which originates on the defensive end of the floor. A perceived snub from the Southeastern Conference All-Defensive squad has fueled the sophomore in the postseason, including the ninth-seeded Aggies' NCAA Tournament first-round win over eighth-seeded Nebraska at FedEx Forum.

The win gives Washington another opportunity to physically plead a case that will be necessary against top-seeded Houston (31-4) in Sunday's 7:40 p.m. second-round matchup in Memphis.

""Yeah, I take it personal,"" Washington said. ""I feel like I'm one of the best defenders in the country and for me to be left off the defensive team, I was a little salty. So, I'm just trying to prove that I'm the best defender every night.""

Fellow Aggie Andersson Garcia received the all-defense nod, along with Auburn's John Broome, Mississippi State's Cameron Matthews, Tennessee's Jonas Aidoo and Tennessee's Sakai Ziegler.

Analytics agree that Washington is the best defender on the Aggie squad. When Washington is on the court, the Aggies' defensive rating drops 7.2 points to 104.1, according to CBB Analytics. However, nationally, Washington still has some room to improve. According to BartTorvik.com, Washington posted a 97.3 defensive rating this season, which ranks 291st in the country. In the postseason, Washington has improved that to 94.8.

Washington has continued to add value in his ability to pull in defensive rebounds. Where he has found trouble as of late is in fouling. For the good that Washington did in the Aggies' first-round blowout win, he picked up two early fouls, which limited his availability in the first half.

""I thought yesterday was really bad,"" A&M coach Buzz Williams said. ""And I was telling him this morning at two-day, I'm like, 'So, we have no chance against Houston if tomorrow you do what you did yesterday. ... We can't absorb [fouls like] that.'""

However, there is a maturation that has taken place within Washington in his two seasons in Aggieland that has helped increase his production. Williams said as much earlier in the season before the Aggies' home bout with Tennessee.

""He's always been physically gifted, at least since I've known him,"" Williams said. ""But I think he's maturing emotionally. He's really, really smart and I've said that from the beginning. And so, I think as he's matured emotionally, it's allowed him to kind of handle the environments, the ambiance, the things that he can't control and the things that he can control. He has distinct presence for us and how we play defensively.""

Sunday, Washington will get another look at the level with which his sights are set. Houston boasts the No. 1 defense in the country, according to KenPom.com, and three of the top defenders according to BartTorvik.com. Guard Jamal Shead ranks third in defensive rating, according to the analytics sites, behind a pair of his teammates, and first in Torvik's proprietary stat, D-PORPAGATU!, that measures defensive effectiveness.

""He can guard anybody in the United States, no matter how old they are and no matter how much money they're getting paid in NIL or though the National Basketball Association,"" Williams said of Shead. ""He's an elite defender.""

Washington has grown as a player through the season, he believes, and already has some lessons in mind that he hopes can show his growth Sunday. In the Aggies' first meeting with the Cougars in December, a narrow 70-66 Aggie loss, Washington allowed two Houston shooters too much space behind the arc during the second half that helped push the Cougars to the win. The latter of the two was an Emanuel Sharp distance shot that put the Cougars up by five with 30 seconds to play.

""I kind of was down on myself after that game and felt like I could have done something better on that to help us win. So, I'm taking it personal,"" Washington said.

A revenge effort by the entire Aggie squad would put A&M in its first Sweet 16 since 2018 and at American Airlines Center in Dallas, no less. As Williams told him, a strong defensive effort from Washington, which includes defensive rebounds and straying from foul trouble, will be necessary if the Aggies want to see their season continue.

""Every coach in America would love to have a Solomon Washington,"" Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson said. ""There's some kids that are tough and they're athletic, but they may not have a winning gene, meaning they're not always where the ball is. He's always where the ball is. He's got a lot of winner.""

NOTES: There's a Southwest Conference flair to the Memphis regional in the NCAA Tournament this year with Baylor leading off Sunday's second-round festivities against Clemson before the Aggies take on Houston. The Cougars hold a 52-31 series record over the Aggies, with A&M claiming the last three wins prior to December's reuniting of the programs. It will be the first time the programs have met in the NCAA Tournament and first time outside the state of Texas. The winner will face the winner of 12th-seeded James Madison and fourth-seeded Duke in Dallas next weekend. ... A&M is 5-4 all time in NCAA Tournament second-round matchups. ... A&M guard Wade Taylor IV needs 31 points to match Don Marbury's record of 697 points in a season, set in 1985-86. With 34 points, he would become the first Aggie ever to reach 700 points in a season.

When the moon blocks the sun and day turns to night on April 8, the sky will take on an otherworldly appearance for those in the path of totality - the roughly 115-mile-wide swath from Texas to Maine. Stars will emerge from their midday slumber, the horizon in all directions will be bathed in a peachy twilight, and - spectacularly - the solar corona will shine from behind the jet-black silhouette of the moon.

The corona is the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, which Earth-dwellers can only see during total solar eclipses. Its appearance constantly evolves because of the sun's ever-changing magnetic field and is different during every solar eclipse. But, on April 8, it will be particularly stunning, according to a newly released simulation from Predictive Science, a San Francisco-based company that develops computer models of the sun and whose work supports a number of NASA missions.

The simulation reveals a dramatic starburst-like pattern with numerous large prominences, including at 7 o'clock bearing, 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. Nearer to the solar disk, a few looping features are visible as well.

Predictive Science has a history of making successful eclipse predictions. But this eclipse will be harder to forecast than normal. That's because the current 11-year solar cycle is near its peak or maximum, when the sun's magnetic field is most chaotic.

The behavior of this magnetic field is important because it contorts the plasma, or the glowing superheated gas that makes up the corona. This luminous plasma traces the sun's magnetic field.

""Magnetic flux on the sun near solar maximum changes a lot,"" Jon Linker, president of Predictive Science, said in an interview. ""Previously we could do a month in advance [prediction] and then another prediction a week in advance. But right now the sun is very dynamic, which makes it very challenging. We're doing something more ambitious this year, in that it's a time-evolving model.""

Despite the challenges in forecasting, Bob Leamon, a NASA researcher focused on solar physics, said that he expects this to be the most spectacular corona of a lifetime.

During eclipses, the corona tends to be least interesting during a solar minimum, when the sun may be without sunspots for days or weeks. Sunspots are regions of enhanced magnetism on the sun; a lack of sunspots means an unremarkable magnetic field, and a rather simple corona. At the sun's north and south poles, ""polar streamers"" of plasma follow magnetic field lines out of or into the sun, but there aren't many loops, prominences or noteworthy features.

That was the case in 2019 during a total eclipse in Chile:

But with solar maximum slated for sometime in mid-2024, scientists anticipate the most dynamic corona possible.

""The more solar activity, the more spikes all the way around from the sun,"" Leamon said. ""I think it's going to be really cool.""

On April 20 last year, a brief total solar eclipse gave 1 minute 2 seconds of totality to areas near Learmonth on the extreme northwest cape of Australia. Notice how much more dynamic the corona was compared with the eclipse in 2019:

There are even more reasons the corona on April 8 has the potential to be quite special. Two major sunspot clusters could contort the corona into even more spectacular shapes.

Of particular interest is the reincarnation of AR3590 (AR stands for active region), a sunspot cluster that produced a trio of top-tier X-class flares in late February. It could rotate from the sun's far side back into view, which could produce prominences, or large streamers and loops of magnetism.

Beyond prominences, there's a chance we may catch a glimpse of a dramatic solar phenomenon known as a coronal mass ejection or CME. That's an eruptive burst of plasma and magnetism from a sunspot. CMEs can interact with Earth's magnetic field and lead to auroras for our viewing pleasure (but they usually take at least a day or two before bombarding our magnetic field).

""With flares and eruptions, there's a very real possibility that we can see a CME going off the side of the sun,"" Leamon said. ""That would be absolutely awesome.""

During the eclipse, ground viewers would see only a phase of a CME in the course of a few minutes, such as some material detaching from the sun. The entire eruption would span an hour or more, which could be observed by stitching many images together taken by people or scientific instruments across the path of totality.

""You might see a large bubble coming off the sun,"" Linker said. ""I think even in the last couple eclipses, there were small CMEs, and there are drawings in the past where people would sketch this bubble."" Some of those drawings date back to the 1870s.

If one launches right before totality, he's hoping his time-evolving model will capture it and predict its behavior - and what it will look like.

Predictive Science is planning to continuously update its predictions of the corona as more data becomes available leading up to the eclipse.",unionleader.com,news,UnionLeader.com,,0.1294117647058823,448936681,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/4c/44c324e2-e868-11ee-a526-b3d3c39b4321/65fdb016482b6.image.jpg?crop=1440%2C756%2C0%2C342&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9420215

here has been a reduction of 36.69 per cent in the volume of coal imported for blending by thermal power plants, amounting to 19.36 million tons (MT) during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the same period of the previous year, the Coal Ministry said on Friday.

This reduction in imported coal for blending signifies a shift towards utilising domestic coal, thus reducing reliance on imports. Imported coal is blended with coal from domestic mines to increase its calorific value.

Conversely, there has been a notable increase of 94.21 per cent in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. These power plants are designed to run only on imported coal, and the growth in imports has been spurred by the sharp decline in international prices of the fuel.

India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54 per cent and 38 per cent respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Overall there has been a reduction in the share of coal import in the total coal consumption in the country. The share of coal import declined to 21 per cent during April 2023 to January 2024, which was 22.48 per cent during the corresponding period of previous year, according to the Coal Ministry statement.

Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278 per cent in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82 per cent during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24.

The reduction in auction premium is a testament to the ample availability of coal (currently 96 MT coal stock with coal companies) in the market, the statement added.

This victory for Haryana was their third over Jharkhand in five meetings they had so far.

The first semifinal of the day was a battle of Haryana pushing from the right channel and Jharkhand's defence standing up with a good effort. Jyoti of Haryana was quick and many a time got past the overlap. However, the first quarter ended goalless despite some efforts by both teams.

In another penetrative run, Jyoti found Sharmila Devi in the circle who fumbled with her shot. Finally, Haryana broke the deadlock off an indirect penalty corner scored by Navneet Kaur (27th). At halftime, Haryana led 1-0.

In the second half, Jharkhand came close through Sangita Kumari who slapped an open opportunity wide. Then Mahima Tete had her try saved by 'keeper and skipper Savita Punia.

Haryana powered ahead in the third quarter with Jyothi scoring their second goal in the 40th minute. Sharma Devi too was successful, scoring their third goal in the 44th minute. Haryana added their fourth goal when Deepika's powerful drag went off a deflection into the goal in the 57th minute to complete the scoreline.

They will take on the winner of the other semifinal between Hockey Madhya Pradesh and Hockey Maharashtra.

Australia is supporting our region to end tuberculosis by investing $17 million in the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis (TB Alliance) to develop more effective treatments for tuberculosis and help ensure they reach those who need them.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major threat in our region. This investment will support TB Alliance to develop and trial a new generation of tuberculosis treatments, including for children.

These new treatments are effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis and are easier for patients to take, helping to prevent further resistance emerging.

Through its new PeerLINC TB Knowledge Hub in Manila, and working with partners such as the Burnet Institute, TB Alliance will support governments to roll out these new treatments including in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea. This will help to ensure that people with tuberculosis across our region are receiving the best available medicines.

Australia has a steadfast commitment to ending tuberculosis. This new investment builds on our long-standing health partnerships with governments in our region and our ongoing support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

The program is funded through Australia's Partnerships for a Healthy Region initiative, which supports countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia to build resilient and equitable health systems.

Reed said they will get it figured out and will play well.

Jackson State women's basketball coach Tomekia Reed lost in the Tigers' NCAA tournament first-round game Saturday, but she won the respect of opposing coach Geno Auriemma of UConn.

After the Huskies rolled to an 86-64 victory in the Portland 3 Region at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut, Auriemma commended Reed on her season. She led Jackson State (26-7) to an undefeated regular season in the Southwestern Athletic Conference, its tournament title and a No. 14 seed in the NCAA tournament.

Auriemma said that coaches at HBCU schools don't get enough recognition for their achievements.

""I wanted to put myself out there for her,"" Auriemma said. ""I think we need coaches like her to be celebrated and bigger schools do not need to be recycling coaches that are let go by other Power Five schools. And they should start looking outside the box a little bit, because there are a lot of good coaches out there, and she is one of them.""

Tomekia Reed's future at Jackson State remains uncertain

As Auriemma endorsed Reed for major college openings, she has only a few days remaining in her contract at Jackson State. The four-year contract extension she signed in July 15, 2020, that pays her approximately $135,000 per year, expires on March 31.

""We are working closely with Coach Reed on her contract to keep her here at Jackson State,"" Robinson told the Clarion Ledger this week.

After the Tigers' 2022 season ended with a close 83-77 loss to LSU in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, Reed told the Clarion Ledger that she interviewed with schools in the Pac-12, Big 12, the American and Mountain West Conference and was a finalist for a Power Five job. She declined to name any of the schools.

When Reed came to Jackson State in 2018, one of her goals was to build a team that could be dominant in the SWAC and competitive outside of the conference. And she is an advocate for HBCU programs, taking time Saturday to commend Grambling, Southern and the University Arkansas-Pine Bluff for winning against Power Five programs this season.

""That's what it is all about,"" Reed said. ""Us (HBCU) gives an awareness to what we do and who we are and gives the best representation to HBCUs. And to continue to grow the game of women's basketball.""

Reed wants change in NCAA Tournament regionals

Reed said that it is important that others recognize what HBCU coaches are doing at that level. Reed said HBCUs are doing the same thing with less resources as what bigger schools are doing.

She said that she is extremely thankful for what the NCAA has done to change the rules and make the games more competitive and for the women's game to be more respected.

""The game does not grow if all Division I levels do not grow,"" Reed said. ""If the HBCUs and lower levels do not grow, the game does not grow. I would love to see the tournament go to a neutral site like men's basketball. We would have a better chance ... Teams like a No.16, 15, 14 seed would have better chance to compete and not have those jitters and be on an even playing field.

""People can come here to buy and distribute power. Our desire is to ensure we have steady power supply to businesses and households in Enugu.""

Speaking on his plans for the education sector, Mbah said that the 260 smart schools currently under construction in the 260 wards in the state were aimed at repositioning the educational sector, adding that the project would be completed in 2025.

Mbah further said the smart school project would go beyond primary school education, adding that a 12-year compulsory and free education to every child born in the state was being planned.

""They will be exposed to a modern learning environment and this will see a transition from chalkboard to smart boards and our pupils will no longer struggle with notebooks as they will be given notepads for their lesson notes. Our children are the epicenter of our plans for the state,"" he added.

Mbah also revealed that his administration has started building 260 Type II Health Centres across the wards, disclosing that 30 of such projects had already been awarded while 100 would soon be awarded. He said the health centres would help to reduce the high maternal mortality rate in the state, which he said was unacceptable.

He added that his administration has increased the number of nurses admitted into state-owned institutions, even as the schools of nursing have started getting the needed face-lift.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.1058823529411765,448936216,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Peter-Mbah-640x360.jpg,eng-9420331

Most Read from Bloomberg

Thanks to a combination of China's energy insecurity -- pushing Beijing back to trusted power sources -- plus rising Indian demand, the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine and faltering international programs to wean developing economies off fossil fuels, coal is proving remarkably resilient. Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

""We see that the world needs more operators to mine coal and support the transition over many decades to come,"" New Hope's Bishop said.

Maritime Union of New Zealand National Secretary Craig Harrison says the Union supports the decarbonization of the transport sector, but until this is a reality there is a need to ensure resilience and fuel security.

Mr Harrison says the Union had opposed the closure of the Marsden Point refinery, as this had undermined resilience and fuel security for New Zealand.

He says another issue was the loss of two New Zealand flagged and crewed oil tankers, as petrol companies had shifted to direct import to New Zealand ports from overseas refineries.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand based tankers should be maintained to distribute supplies around New Zealand ports, with the ability to act as mobile storage facilities.

He says New Zealand has limited fuel reserves, and is now dependent on overseas shipping.

""During COVID there was severe disruption of shipping, and if there was a major conflict or natural disaster that cut links with overseas refineries, New Zealand would be helpless.""

Mr Harrison says New Zealand tankers could obtain overseas fuel supplies in the event of global supply chain disruptions, and could assist in the event of a natural disaster within New Zealand.

He says the problem of contaminated or 'off spec' fuel supplies had resulted in several incidents of aviation fuel shortages at New Zealand airports in the last two years.

This still had the potential to cause serious disruption as replacement fuel supplies from Asian refineries could take some time to be delivered.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand's fuel security should not be at the mercy of the commercial interests of overseas owned fuel companies, which was behind the refinery closure.

""There are current conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and tensions in the Asia Pacific region, together with the ongoing threat of extreme weather due to climate change and seismic events. New Zealand needs to ensure its resilience and fuel security.""",voxy.co.nz,news,Voxy.co.nz,Fuseworks Media,0.223529411764706,448935935,1,,eng-9411924

Gender Interactive Alliance executive director Bindiya Rana led the demonstration, which was attended by transgender persons, human and women rights activists among other people from different walks of life.

The demonstration was held by Aurat March and Sindh Moorat March against a mob attack on transgender persons Shehzadi Rao, who is also a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation council member on a reserved seat for the transgender people on the Pakistan Peoples Party ticket.

Rana condemned violence against several transgender persons by a mob in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, a tragic incident which happened recently. She said the around 50 to 60 men tortured six transgender persons and extended death threats to them.

She accused the police of facilitating the miscreants, saying that instead of registering an FIR against them and taking action, the officers forced the victims to make a compromise with the suspects.

Rana added that police without any reason have also started thrashing transgender persons who beg at traffic signals during the holy month of Ramazan.

She lamented that despite tall claims of the government to make inclusive policies and systems, transgender persons had no adequate representation in any institution and were treated as third-class citizens.

The GIA head demanded from the Sindh chief minister, governor and inspector general of police to take notice of violence against transgender persons and provide them with justice.

She added that the government and its institutions should also provide relief to the downtrodden and underprivileged segments of society, including transgender persons and religious minorities, during this month to alleviate their suffering.

Protest leaders said that just 10 days after they marched on Karachi's streets in the Aurat March on March 8 along with their khwajasira siblings with their slogan for azaadi, a mob attacked a group of transgender women in Gulistan-e-Jauhar at around midnight.

""We will burn you all,"" the transgender people present there were told as they tried to make it out alive. In the process, men from within the mob also physically and sexually assaulted some of them.

The Aurat March representatives said the transgender people be given azaadi from this dehumanization, which has worsened by over 200 percent due to a hate campaign launched nearly two years ago.

The mob attack in question was rooted in an intense hatred against transgender people -- a hatred that has been imported from the West and is being regurgitated by the conservative elites in Pakistan in order to keep their undue power intact.

Aurat March representative Zoha Alvis said that one should not forget that the worst sufferers in this environment of hate are people whose existence precedes the existence of Pakistan itself: South Asia's indigenous khwajasira community.

""We believe that transphobia is the highest form of misogyny and the hatred being directed towards the trans community is part of a larger patriarchal system of violence on our bodies, which will add to the oppression of cisgender women as well,"" she said.

In the protest, they demanded transphobic speech be considered as hate speech under the law. They demanded that the Sindh Police establish Tahaffuz centres across Sindh for transgender people and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 be upheld in its original form urgently.

They protesters said that the perpetrators of the mob and the person who beat up a trans woman that day should issue a public apology to the trans community, and the police safety for community members in the area.",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,-0.3333333333333334,448935831,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-03-24/l_1171720_050033_updates.jpg,

Michael McGehee, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, emphasized the potential of perovskites to dramatically increase the efficiency of solar panels by absorbing a wider spectrum of the sun's rays.

A key innovation in the study is the use of dimethylammonium formate (DMAFo) in the perovskite solution, which allows for the semiconductor to be coated onto glass plates in ambient air without oxidation, a critical step towards large-scale commercial production. This method not only preserves the efficiency of perovskite cells at nearly 25% but also significantly enhances their stability compared to current standards.

The longevity and durability of perovskite cells made with DMAFo were proven in tests showing a 90% efficiency retention after 700 hours under simulated sunlight, marking a substantial improvement over cells without this additive.

McGehee's work, part of the Tandems for Efficient and Advanced Modules using Ultrastable Perovskites (TEAMUP) project, aims to develop tandem cells that combine perovskite and silicon technologies to achieve over 30% efficiency. Funded by a $9 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, the TEAMUP consortium is advancing towards creating solar cells that are not only more efficient but also competitively priced and stable over a 25-year lifespan.

These advancements hold promise for a wide array of applications, from extending the range of electric vehicles with solar-powered roofs to providing renewable energy for drones and sailboats. McGehee's vision for perovskite cells to eventually dominate the solar market underscores the transformative potential of this research, bringing the industry closer to a renewable energy future.",solardaily.com,news,Solar Daily,,0.6235294117647059,448935812,1,https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/solarcell-panels-wind-turbine-farm-canva-ai-hg.jpg,eng-9417099

Output hit a record last year, and producers are preparing for a future where they will be required for decades yet to balance renewable energy.

Even prices are holding up. While thermal coal is trading at just a fraction of the lofty levels reached in 2022, after Russia's invasion of its neighbour, prices are still well above historic norms. Benchmark Newcastle coal futures are changing hands just under $130 a ton, roughly a quarter of the peak but higher than any level between 2011 and 2020.

Much of this second wind is down to Asia. In 2000, the International Energy Agency estimated advanced economies accounted for almost half of coal consumption. By 2026, China and India alone will make up more than 70%. Those two heavyweights and Indonesia started operating new coal power plants amounting to 59 gigawatts last year, and either launched or revived proposals for another 131 gigawatts -- about 93% of the world's total, according to Global Energy Monitor.

""You look at Asia, the demand and the build-out of coal-fired power plants, particularly in India -- coal's not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Rob Bishop, chief executive officer of Australian miner New Hope Corp., said in an interview.

The extended final act will be a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against the feasibility of shifting swiftly out of carbon-intensive power, pointing out benefits in terms of reliability and cost. A mention of coal's buoyancy earned Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser a round of applause at a major energy conference in Houston last week.

It's less good news for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

For years, analysts expected coal production to plateau after it hit a then-record in 2013. Funding, after all, was drying up. Then came 2021, when power shortages in China set Beijing on a path to order more mining to ensure energy security.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blackouts during heatwaves in India further bolstered coal demand. By last year, output had risen to a record 8.7 billion tons, according to the IEA.

That figure is expected to drop this year. But the agency expects it to stabilize through 2026 -- in line with industry forecasts of a long goodbye.

All of this is visible on the ground. In China, which produces and consumes half the world's coal, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates after boosting output 21% over the past three years to 4.7 billion tons. Low-cost reserves have mostly been tapped, leading companies to dig deeper, more expensive mines. Fatalities have also started rising after years of declines.

Record amounts of new solar panels and wind turbines, along with a rebound in hydropower and steadily growing nuclear generation, mean low-carbon energy will likely exceed the growth in electricity consumption, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

But that clean energy will also be coal's lifeline, said Zhang Hong, deputy secretary-general of the China National Coal Association. Renewable power only generates when weather permits, so even as other baseload options emerge, cheap and reliable coal will still play a role.

""The next 10 to 15 years will remain a crucial strategic window,"" Zhang said.

India is the one country where the IEA forecasts coal output to grow this year, with production set to top 1 billion tons for the first time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports. Yet even after a surge in renewables, nuclear, hydropower and other baseload options have fallen short -- so coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power at least until the end of this decade.

Indonesia, meanwhile, the world's top thermal coal exporter, sees production stable for the next two years. That's partly to feed surging domestic demand from a booming, power-hungry nickel processing sector, even if lower prices eventually cool enthusiasm.

But it's also evidence of the difficulty of accelerating the end of coal where economies have newer plants, rising energy demand and an urgent need to create jobs. In 2022, Jakarta agreed to a $20 billion green deal with wealthy governments and financial institutions that would, among other things, close coal power stations early. Coal phaseouts, however, have proved far more challenging than anticipated. Landmark deals remain on the negotiating table.

Coal's days are numbered, of course. Advances in solar and wind have made those technologies far cheaper than coal power in most parts of the world, and similar gains for batteries and energy storage systems could finally make around-the-clock renewable power affordable enough to transform the energy mix.

But for now, the transition is testing years-long expectations of rapid peaks and subsequent steep declines.

The Maritime Union says it welcomes the new investigation into the feasibility of reopening the Marsden Point Refinery, announced by Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones.

Maritime Union of New Zealand National Secretary Craig Harrison says the Union supports the decarbonization of the transport sector, but until this is a reality there is a need to ensure resilience and fuel security.

Mr Harrison says the Union had opposed the closure of the Marsden Point refinery, as this had undermined resilience and fuel security for New Zealand.

He says another issue was the loss of two New Zealand flagged and crewed oil tankers, as petrol companies had shifted to direct import to New Zealand ports from overseas refineries.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand based tankers should be maintained to distribute supplies around New Zealand ports, with the ability to act as mobile storage facilities.

He says New Zealand has limited fuel reserves, and is now dependent on overseas shipping.

""During COVID there was severe disruption of shipping, and if there was a major conflict or natural disaster that cut links with overseas refineries, New Zealand would be helpless.""

Mr Harrison says New Zealand tankers could obtain overseas fuel supplies in the event of global supply chain disruptions, and could assist in the event of a natural disaster within New Zealand.

He says the problem of contaminated or 'off spec' fuel supplies had resulted in several incidents of aviation fuel shortages at New Zealand airports in the last two years.

This still had the potential to cause serious disruption as replacement fuel supplies from Asian refineries could take some time to be delivered.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand's fuel security should not be at the mercy of the commercial interests of overseas owned fuel companies, which was behind the refinery closure.

""There are current conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and tensions in the Asia Pacific region, together with the ongoing threat of extreme weather due to climate change and seismic events. New Zealand needs to ensure its resilience and fuel security.""",business.scoop.co.nz,news,Scoop,,0.08235294117647052,448935600,1,https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg,eng-9411924

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) -- Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREPARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Russia launched a significant airstrike on Ukrainian power facilities, described by Kyiv as the most extensive assault on its energy infrastructure in the two-year conflict.

The attack, purportedly in retaliation for Ukrainian actions during its recent presidential election, hit a crucial dam over the Dnipro River.

The strike resulted in widespread power outages, leaving over a million people without electricity. Kyiv has urgently sought assistance from neighboring countries like Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to mitigate the crisis.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the strikes, emphasizing the need for enhanced air defense systems to counter Russian aggression. He called upon Ukraine's allies to demonstrate the necessary political will to provide essential support.

However, military aid from Western nations, including a significant package from the United States, has faced delays due to political disputes.

The assault revived memories of previous attacks on Ukraine's power grid, further exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. Repair efforts have been underway, but several regions continue to face significant blackouts.

The Russian defense ministry justified the airstrike as retaliation for alleged Ukrainian provocations during a recent staged election, which saw Vladimir Putin secure another term as president.

Despite Russia's denial of targeting civilians, the ongoing conflict has resulted in significant civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. Moscow maintains that Ukrainian power facilities are legitimate military targets aimed at weakening Kyiv's military capabilities.

The situation has prompted concerns about an escalation of hostilities and the potential for further humanitarian crises.

As the conflict persists, international leaders have emphasized the importance of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions and prevent further violence. The UN has condemned the attacks, highlighting the severe humanitarian consequences for millions of Ukrainians.

The sales surge would be propelled by falling battery prices and resultant product price cuts by some automakers, robust government support for eco-friendly vehicles, higher prices of fossil fuels and growing environmental awareness among consumers. Launch of new models by automakers is also helping attract new buyers into this segment. This year's sales performance would mark a 67% jump from the 60,910 electric PVs sold in FY23.

In the electric two-wheeler segment too, sales are expected to climb 25% to an all-time high of more than 758,000 units this fiscal, according to market research firm Jato Dynamics.

Despite the robust sales, EV penetration in India remains low due to consumer concerns over affordability, range anxiety and inadequate charging infrastructure.

EVs currently comprise about 2.3% of all passenger vehicles sold in the country. In two-wheelers, the electric share is 4.8% of the domestic market.

Carmakers are raising their bets by launching more electric mass models. Tata Motors dominates the EV market with its Tiago, Nexon, Tigor and Punch models, followed by MG Motor India, and Mahindra & Mahindra. China's BYD, a relatively new entrant, is also making strong inroads, surging ahead of even established rivals such as South Korea's Hyundai and Kia.

Tata Motors, with a more than 70% share of the EV market, plans to expand its portfolio in this category by rolling out the Harrier EV and Curvv EV models over the next few months.

The automaker, India's third-largest, has lofty electric ambitions. EVs already account for 14-15% of the company's sales, which it aims to increase to 25% by 2027 and 50% by the end of the decade.

EVs continue to make up a major share of MG Motor India's overall vehicle sales, accounting for about 33% of total units sold in February. Gaurav Gupta, deputy managing director at MG Motor India, said, ""Around 30% of our total sales come from our EV models, as the company is continuing to enhance its product portfolio.""

MG is one of the first automakers to launch EVs in India, starting with the ZS model, and the Comet launched last year.

China's SAIC Motor Corp-owned MG Motor India and JSW also kickstarted a joint venture that will produce both electric and internal combustion engine cars with the aim of capturing a large chunk of the Indian market.

In the two-wheeler segment, Ola Electric leads the pack with the highest sales and market share, followed by TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto, and Ather Energy.

While EVs have a higher upfront cost, their lower fuel and maintenance expenses, coupled with government incentives, make them relatively more cost-competitive compared with petrol and diesel vehicles in the long run, especially for high-mileage drivers, CareEdge Ratings said in its latest report.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.1686274509803922,448935403,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108738657,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-80940,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-9418000

The fintech platform said the transaction is a key milestone, and is its first white label deal. It noted that the inventory is that of an existing client of Banco BPM. The client is within the agrifood supply chain, producing Italian cheese, it said.

White labelling refers to rebranding a manufacturer's product under the name of a seller.

It said Banco BPM will fund the transaction via an EUR8.5 million bank debt as well as EUR1.5 million of equity investment.

It added that the white label client has signed a commitment up to EUR10 million to become a re-marketer of a potential client in Supply@Me's pipeline.

Chief Executive Alessandro Zamboni said: ""Achieving the Commitment from BBPM for our first White Label transaction is a momentous milestone for the group which demonstrates the value and applicability of our proprietary Inventory Monetisation model for commercial banks and their customer base.

""BBPM is the perfect partner for us to initiate and scale our White Label business line. It's credibility and long-standing reputation as one of Italy's foremost leading banking groups will enable us to bring our solution to a much greater number of clients, providing a means for businesses to improve their capital positions by offering access to funding based exclusively on the value of their inventory.""

Supply@Me shares rose 0.7% to 0.070 pence each on Wednesday afternoon in London.

Water supply was restored by evening, but at low pressure.

The fault which snapped the power supply was reported around 5am on Saturday. Pune Municipal Corporation's (PMC) water supply department sought MSEDCL's assistance to restore the supply and restart pumping of water. Restoration works were underway till afternoon.

Residents were caught unawares due to the sudden stoppage in water supply. Local activist from Dhayari Mahesh Pokale said people approached him with complaints about water being unavailable. ""We requested PMC to make alternative arrangements till restoration of power supply to the distribution network.""

Raj Kopurkar, a resident of Dhankawadi, said that water pressure was already low in the area since the last few days. ""The supply stopped on Saturday. Water was not available till evening. The PMC should supply water for additional hours on Sunday to reduce hardships,"" he added. The Wadgaon water treatment unit provides water to the city's southern parts and pockets around Sinhagad Road.

PMC officials said water pumping at the plant started at midnight and was supposed to continue till morning. However, it faced disruptions around 5am following a technical snag.

Referring to the recent arrest of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at a public rally organised in Indapur by MVA , he said, ""Kejriwal is known for opening health clinics and schools for common people. Leaders from other parts of the country visit Delhi to study his model of schools and clinics, but the central government has put him in prison. Kejriwal and former chief minister of Jharkhand Hemant Soren's arrest are examples of how power is being misused by this government to suppress the opposition.""

Besides Pawar, other leaders of the alliance parties, including Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat and MVA's Baramati candidate Supriya Sule were present in the rally.

Highlighting the central government's decision to continue with the onion export ban, the former Union agriculture minister claimed that Modi had promised of doubling farmers' income but in reality, farmers were in distress because of wrong policies. ""Before coming to power, Modi had promised to take decisions for the welfare of the common man. After getting power, he has not shown any concern for the common people. At present, there are issues like inflation, unemployment and corruption, but the government is silent on them,"" Pawar said.

He claimed that the intention of BJP was to get maximum seats in Parliament to change the Constitution. ""If we want to save the Constitution and the democracy of the country, we will have to unite and make sure the people in power do not retain it,"" Pawar said.

Senior Congress leader Thorat also criticised the central government over recent actions against the opposition leaders. He said while the opposition parties were preparing manifestos and setting agenda for the elections, the ruling party, BJP, was preparing to target the opposition to win the polls.

Can you provide insights into the alleged N100bn in outstanding electricity bills owed by the government?

The Nigerian government does not owe N100bn. The ministries, departments and agencies of the government owe the amount in electricity bills. Each of these MDAs is a stand-alone body, so this does not mean that the government is the one owing. These ministries have their budgets appropriated to them. So, it's not Mr (Bola) Tinubu that is expected to pay. The MDA debts have been there since 2013 and we've had three presidents since then. When we talk about MDAs, we're also talking about military formations.

However, some of the military formations pay their bills. The major culprit is the Army in terms of military formations. If you go and check with the Ministry of Defence, there are provisions in their budgets; so I cannot blame the Defence minister or the President for the non-payment of electricity bills by the MDAs.

It's not that the government is not paying or doesn't want to pay; it's the government agencies that are not paying, and they all have budgets; we have continuously asked for this. Four weeks ago, it took a published advert to call the attention of the President before he became aware of the indebtedness. Should the President be the one paying bills for the Aso Rock? No. It was when he saw it that he ordered that they should settle their bills. If we don't say anything, the bills will remain unpaid.

What measures are being taken to address this issue of outstanding electricity bills?

One such measure is the publication of adverts to ask them to pay. We can't cut off all the MDAs. For example, the military formations will tell you that if you disconnect the power supply, it will affect their armoury. That's what they told us. The Nigeria Defence Academy also owes but we can't put it at the doorstep of one of them, so that is why I said military formations owe and that's a fact. The measures we're taking include demanding payment from them. I believe that the matter is getting better attention from the government now than before, maybe it's because the announcement that the MDAs owe is very embarrassing.

If we call different distribution companies, they will state how much they are being owed. I know that many MDAs have yet to pay their bills but I don't want to give out an embarrassing headline that will make foreigners think that Nigeria is an irresponsible country. They are wrong and those of them that can be disconnected will be disconnected at the appropriate time after giving them an appropriate legal notice. It is irresponsible for any governmental department to refuse to pay electricity bills.

The MDA debts need to be paid. Payment of the MDAs' debts will enable us in the power sector to be able to invest more in the system. You can't invest where it does not yield profits. I'm not giving excuses for them. Non-payment of energy debt is affecting the performance of the Discos and power generation companies. The press mostly looks at the inefficiency of the Discos but does not ask questions about the reason for the inefficiency.

What factors contribute to the frequent collapse of the national grid, and what steps are being taken to enhance its stability and reliability?

The biggest factor that contributes to the frequent collapse of the national grid is the shortage of gas. The low frequency is brought about by a shortage and unavailability of gas to generate more electricity and the generation becomes so low. We have three hydroelectric power plants in Jebba, Shiroro, and Kainji, which are all in Niger State. They are all collectively contributing less than one-quarter of the quantum of the power that we generate in the country. The major power that we generate in the country comes from thermal power or gas-fired power plants. These include the Egbin, Olorunsogo, and Omotoso power plants.

These power plants depend on gas to fire their turbines just as cars depend on petrol to fire them. The problem in the last two months is because of indebtedness to gas suppliers. There are legacy debts that have yet to be paid by the government. The Discos are collection agents. They only retain 20 per cent of what they collect. They have to remit everything to the value chain - generation, transmission, and distribution. So, if they do not collect enough, they cannot pay enough. For example, Benin Disco took electricity worth N12bn from the generation companies. But so far, it has only been able to collect N7bn. That means it is short of N5bn.

If the indebtedness to the gas suppliers is settled, do you think the national grid will be stable to supply stable power?

Yes, because efforts are being made, even by the last government, to install some equipment for the Transmission Company of Nigeria to enhance its efficiency. There are ongoing projects like the Siemens project from Germany. What is crippling the power sector is liquidity and lack of money. If there's no money to invest, you cannot do anything because when you keep on owing your suppliers, they won't supply again. That's what happened in the last two months. The gas suppliers are not supplying. The gas suppliers are not part of the power sector. These are international oil companies that sell their gas to the international market where they make more money than to the domestic market.

Apart from liquidity, what other challenges is the electricity distribution sector facing to ensure stable power supply across the country?

Energy theft is another challenge and it adds to the liquidity crisis. If people are stealing the little that we have, how can we have more? Energy theft includes vandalism, illegal connection, and meter bypass. By the time you calculate the losses, that is the cause of the liquidity crisis. Someone took goods worth N11bn and can only collect N7bn; that means N4bn has been stolen. In addition, there is also the issue of non-payment. If you give some people a bill of N5,000, they end up paying N2,000. How do we account for the N3,000 balance? Not until we all agree that there's a need for all of us to play our part, Nigeria will be in a mess. We are in a mess already.

How do you respond to criticisms regarding the performance and efficiency of the electricity distribution companies?

First, we are not efficient enough and we have a lot more to do. However, efficiency is also linked to pricing. You cannot expect an entity that sells below the cost price to be efficient. So, while I'll agree that we are not efficient enough due to the liquidity crisis, I also feel that some of those blaming us are doing so out of ignorance. You give them a prepaid meter, they bypass it, they connect appliances like their air conditioners, refrigerators, and many more illegally, and many Nigerians want electricity free of charge and they keep lying that they will pay but it's only a lie, they don't pay; they can argue from morning till night about bad light or inadequate power supply, but when they are provided with the light, they do not like to pay for it.

Some of the people who make such comments and who are quick to criticise us, if you check their bills and the appliances they run, they are the worst; so, we are all guilty and all of us need to play our part, that is the best solution.

What is the role of government policies and regulations in shaping the electricity system?

Well, as for the regulators, they are the policemen of the sector and they have been playing that role effectively well considering the environment within which we all operate; as for the government policies too, there have been a lot of improvements in the government policies over the years and it has been that way since 2013, and I can say that with the way they are driving it, we believe that with time we can begin to show better results. So the role of the government and their policies is very germane; we cannot underestimate their importance.

What initiatives or investments are being made to upgrade and modernise the electricity distribution infrastructure in the country?

Well, what needs to be upgraded is not just electricity distribution; if we are talking of distribution, distribution does not stand alone, it is a part of the value chain; however, what I can say is that the government has made efforts and will continue to make efforts to upgrade all the dilapidated infrastructure; we have an ongoing project with Siemens, which is a German equipment manufacturer; other initiatives are also ongoing towards renewing the infrastructure, it's just that these projects and initiatives are very capital intensive and it will take a bit of time for all of these to show before Nigerians can see them.

How do you address concerns about electricity theft and illegal connections?

Well, we are trying our possible best to reduce it by deploying more technology, but mind you the deployment of technology also comes at a huge cost, because it is not cheap; we are also trying to ensure that people who are caught are handed over to the law enforcement agencies. We will try to partner the police, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to ensure that those who are caught stealing energy or vandalising any of the equipment are brought to justice. That is another ongoing effort to address energy theft, and we need the cooperation of the judiciary and other agents because we cannot prosecute by ourselves, but we can only catch them and hand them over to law enforcement agencies so that they can face the wrath of the law.

We also rely on our customers to say something whenever they see something; we encourage the public to provide intelligence that can be useful to catch individuals within our communities who vandalise and steal energy; we believe that if we as individuals cooperate, we can deal with a lot of these issues.

Are there any plans to improve customer service and engagement within the electricity distribution sector to improve consumer satisfaction?

We have continuously engaged with our consumers. For instance, I have been in Benin throughout this week to engage with our consumers in different communities; every other distribution company does it, and we go to different community development association meetings every weekend, and we do this simultaneously over the country to enlighten people and let them know the problem that we have with energy theft and how it affects everyone. We do that to stamp out the menace of energy theft; so yes, we do that because that is the only way out. By engaging with customers, we were able to enlighten them about their roles, just like here in Benin, some of them did not understand their roles; we were able to show them their roles, and also how bypass affects peoples' bills; so the more you let people know about their roles, the better they can play their part once they understand that it affects them. It is a continuous thing because we realised that there can never be too much information; we just have to keep on giving them more information to help them understand their roles.

How can fair electricity tariff structure be guaranteed while balancing the financial capability of the distribution companies and affordability for consumers?

It is regulated already; that is the job of our regulators; we are in a heavily regulated industry and everything we do is regulated by the regulators. Every single step is taken according to laid down rules and the Discos cannot deviate from them, they can't just fix tariffs, everything is done scientifically by looking at the economic indices, different factors, conditions, situations, locations, and availability of electricity, among other factors, and they deal with us and make sure to sanction us anytime we fail to carry out our duties properly. It is not easy; they (Discos) are trying their best; they operate in a heavily regulated industry and not where any service provider can just do whatever he likes.

What strategies are being implemented to attract investments and promote private sector participation in the electricity distribution sector?

We already have private sector participation, so when you mention the distribution sector it is private; the Electricity Act of 2023 is also part of the strategies for more private participation. In terms of foreign direct investment, I think that it is up to the government to provide an enabling environment that will encourage foreign investors to come and invest in the sector; the government has to provide that environment that will attract foreigners to invest their money in the country.

How can Nigeria prioritise the adoption of technology and innovation to optimise energy distribution and management?

We do that a lot, what is hampering all of these is just the issue of cost; one cannot succeed in this business without giving priority to technology because it is the most important thing, and we need to deploy technology to be able to bypass some of the ills that we face in the sector. I believe that there is still a lot to be done. I would love to see a power sector in Nigeria where people will be happy because they will be paying for what they consume, but we are not there yet, we still have a long way to go; some people don't want to pay; they will rather use electricity free of charge.

We have some of our staff members who don't treat customers properly; we also have some corrupt elements within our system, but corruption is a two-way thing - if the people who give them money continue to give them, the corruption will never stop - so we have a society that still needs a lot more information and orientation to understand the evil of giving the bribe and the long term implications of it; these are some things we are making efforts to include and it is not achievable in a month, it takes time so we have to continuously engage with Nigerians we have to make them understand what their role should be in the sector.",punchng.com,news,Punch Newspapers,Ajibade Omape,0.06666666666666665,448934750,1,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23215650/SUNDAY-ODUNTAN.jpg,

The common misconception is that you need money to make money.

However, you need to change your mindset about money.

The common mindset is that money is a scarce resource.

That's what you learn from your teachers and from the economists. Actually, economics is the study of scarcity.

This explains why 99% of people believe that money is a scarce resource.

If you want to know this is true, try to tell a rich man to give you money.

I know you've probably tried to borrow money from your rich uncle and got a shock. That is, if you have a rich uncle.

That's understandable because people feel ashamed to refuse you food when you're hungry.

What people don't seem to understand is that there's no difference between money and food, but they'll still refuse you money and give you food.

People think money is a scarce resource, so they won't give you the money if you ask them for it.

But that's the misconception.

Money is actually the abundant resource, because money is actually paper. It's only given value by the central bank or the federal reserve when they sign it.

At least food goes into your stomach so it's more valuable.

If people only knew, food is actually the scarcity they should preserve instead of throwing it to the garbage bin.

I'll tell you this:

Money is actually the labor you exchange for your sweat and effort.

I wish people knew this.

But a lot of people don't have it because they don't know how to exchange their sweat and effort with money.

More accurately, they don't know how to exchange value (their sweat and effort) with money.

Instead, most people are looking for a job, which pay way less than the sweat and effort they put, because people don't know their worth.

Therefore they're paid peanuts because they don't know their value.

In ancient China, emperors would abdicate in order to avoid what was thought to be negative energy from an eclipse, and put a proxy ruler on the throne for the duration.

Medieval archers would, at the behest of a worried king, loose a volley of arrows to the Moon in an effort to ward off a looming lunar eclipse.

Centuries later, celestial events and their associations with beginnings and endings have underpinned important milestones in our modern Royal Family, too.

King Charles was both born on an eclipse and crowned on one. He married Diana during an eclipse... and 16 years later she died on one.

The present Princess of Wales's announcement that she is undergoing treatment for cancer was notably close to tomorrow's full moon eclipse, in line with several other major royal events

The significance in an eclipse being so close to such an event in marking another cycle of beginnings and endings is plain to astrologers such as myself, writes DEBBIE FRANK

Their son, William, was also born on an eclipse as was his wife Kate. So fascinated by this was I that, as the personal astrologer to Princess Diana, we discussed the significance of then Prime Minister John Major announcing her separation from Charles on the lunar eclipse of December 9, 1992.

The present Princess of Wales's announcement that she is undergoing treatment for cancer was notably close to tomorrow's full moon eclipse.

Its significance in marking another cycle of beginnings and endings is plain to astrologers such as myself.

Kate and William were born six months apart, and both - unusually - have Mars and Libra featuring prominently in their birth charts, right under the eye of this lunar eclipse.

It makes this eclipse highly personal for them, flagging up a challenge to be overcome.

Happily, though, the planets also give us great cause for optimism.

But the planets give us cause for optimism, with a solar eclipse set to appear in both Kate and William's birth chart six months from when the Princess first began treatment - a significant milestone in chemotherapy

On October 2, a solar eclipse will appear in both Kate and William's birth chart, marking a new beginning. This will be six months on from when the Princess first began treatment - a time generally considered to be a significant milestone in chemotherapy.

This is a hopeful sign for her recovery, which will see Kate and William emerge stronger than ever.

What's more, the planets give us more reasons to be positive, too. A Capricorn, Kate is blessed with an extremely strong and resilient astrological signature, while steely Saturn and powerful Pluto also play an important role in her birth chart.

It is an extraordinarily resolute and strong astrological combination - reassuring for all those sending heartfelt wishes for her recovery.",expressdigest.com,news,expressdigest.com,,-0.2313725490196078,448934326,1,,

Maritime Union of New Zealand National Secretary Craig Harrison says the Union supports the decarbonization of the transport sector, but until this is a reality there is a need to ensure resilience and fuel security.

Mr Harrison says the Union had opposed the closure of the Marsden Point refinery, as this had undermined resilience and fuel security for New Zealand.

He says another issue was the loss of two New Zealand flagged and crewed oil tankers, as petrol companies had shifted to direct import to New Zealand ports from overseas refineries.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand based tankers should be maintained to distribute supplies around New Zealand ports, with the ability to act as mobile storage facilities.

He says New Zealand has limited fuel reserves, and is now dependent on overseas shipping.

""During COVID there was severe disruption of shipping, and if there was a major conflict or natural disaster that cut links with overseas refineries, New Zealand would be helpless.""

Mr Harrison says New Zealand tankers could obtain overseas fuel supplies in the event of global supply chain disruptions, and could assist in the event of a natural disaster within New Zealand.

He says the problem of contaminated or 'off spec' fuel supplies had resulted in several incidents of aviation fuel shortages at New Zealand airports in the last two years.

This still had the potential to cause serious disruption as replacement fuel supplies from Asian refineries could take some time to be delivered.

Mr Harrison says New Zealand's fuel security should not be at the mercy of the commercial interests of overseas owned fuel companies, which was behind the refinery closure.

""There are current conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and tensions in the Asia Pacific region, together with the ongoing threat of extreme weather due to climate change and seismic events. New Zealand needs to ensure its resilience and fuel security.""",scoop.co.nz,news,Scoop,,-0.0980392156862745,448934173,1,http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,

These submarines not only marked the U.S. Navy's transition into modern nuclear-powered attack submarines but also demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to submarine design and performance.

One of the most forward-looking submarine classes ever to serve in the U.S. Navy, the Skipjacks paved the way for the country's modern nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

The Skipjack submarines were not ""just"" a serially-produced class of nuclear-powered attack submarines -- though, in the mid-1950s, that alone would have been a respectable achievement. Rather, the Skipjack class combined two of the great submarine engineering innovations of its time: nuclear power and a teardrop hull design. Whereas the earlier Skate-class attack submarines housed an S3W nuclear reactor in a conventional design that resembled the submarines of yore, the Skipjacks employed a forward-looking teardrop hull design that emphasized superior underwater performance. Moreover, the Skipjack class was the first submarine to feature the newer S5W that remained the Navy's go-to nuclear reactor until the 1970s introduction of the S6G reactor that powered the Los Angeles-class.

These two revolutionary features were not just individually beneficial but actively complemented one another. The Skipjack boats' S5W nuclear reactors allowed them to stay submerged most of the time, all but removing the need for surface handling optimizations. At the same time, the class registered excellent underwater performance due to its teardrop hull.

It is this potent blend of high-ticket features, skillfully woven into a single submarine class, that arguably earned the Skipjack the title of the U.S. Navy's first modern submarine. At thirty-three knots submerged, the Skipjacks were the fastest U.S. nuclear submarines until the introduction of the Los Angeles class. They also boasted a fairly robust weapons loadout, consisting of six 533mm torpedo tubes that accepted weapons including the Navy's workhorse Mark 14 and Mark 16 torpedoes, the Mark 37 anti-submarine homing torpedo, nuclear-capable Mark 45 torpedoes, and advanced Mark 48 torpedoes for high-value submarines and surface targets.

Six Skipjack submarines -- Skipjack, Scamp, Scorpion, Sculpin, Shark, and Snook -- were rushed into service from 1959 to 1961.

The Skipjacks lived a fairly uneventful service life throughout the Cold War and Vietnam War years, with one tragic exception. The Scorpion became one of only two nuclear submarines to be lost by the U.S. Navy, with the other being the USS Thresher. In May 1968, the Scorpion vanished without a trace while away on an espionage mission in the Atlantic. Parts of Scorpion's hull were found later that year; the entire, 99-strong crew was presumed to have perished along with the submarine.

The Scorpion's demise remains a topic of conjecture, with theories ranging from a Soviet torpedo attack to a hydrogen explosion. The Navy's reports on the incident proved inconclusive. The military initially ascribed Scorpion's loss to an inadvertent torpedo detonation, but that account has been vigorously disputed in subsequent expert analysis.

Making matters even more bizarre, the Scorpion incident was one of four submarine disappearances in 1968-the others being the Israeli INS Dakar, French Minerve, and Soviet K-129-all within the span of five months.

The last submarines in the Skipjack series were decommissioned in the early 1990s. Their three decades of service is a lasting testament to a submarine class well ahead of its time.",nationalinterest.org,news,The National Interest,,0.01960784313725483,448933710,1,https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/Skipjack-Class%20Submarine%20U.S.%20Navy.jpg,eng-9417001

Strategic stability is usually understood as the absence of incentives for a nuclear-armed power to launch a massive first strike. Typically, it's viewed primarily in military-technical terms. The reasons why an attack may be contemplated are usually not taken into account.

This idea emerged in the middle of the last century, when the USSR had achieved military-strategic parity with the US and the Cold War between them had entered a ""mature"" phase of limited confrontation and some predictability. The solution to the problem of strategic stability was then seen in the constant maintenance of contacts between the political leadership of the two superpowers. Which led to arms control and transparency in arranging their respective arsenals.

However, the first quarter of the 21st century is ending in conditions very different from the relative international political stability of the 1970s. The US-centric world order established after the end of the Cold War is being seriously challenged and its foundations are visibly shaken. The global hegemony of Washington and the position of the collective West as a whole is weakening, while the economic, military, scientific and technological power and political importance of non-Western countries -first and foremost China, but also India- are growing. This is leading to a deterioration in relations between the US and other centers of power.

The two largest nuclear powers, Russia and the US, are in a state of semi-direct armed conflict. This confrontation is officially regarded in Russia as an existential threat. This situation has become possible as a result of the failure of strategic deterrence (in its geopolitical dimension) in an area where Russia's vital interests are present. It should be noted that the main cause of the conflict is Washington's conscious disregard -for three decades now- of Moscow's clearly and explicitly expressed security interests.

Moreover, in the Ukrainian conflict, the US military and political leadership has not only articulated, but has publicly expressed, the mission of using its proxy to inflict a strategic military defeat on Russia, despite its nuclear status.

This is a complex task in which the collective efforts of the West in the economic, political, military and military-technical, intelligence, information and other fields are integrated with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces in direct combat with the Russian army. In other words, the US is trying to defeat Russia not only without using nuclear weapons, but even without formally engaging in hostilities.

In this context, the declaration of the five nuclear powers of January 3, 2022, that ""nuclear war should not be waged"" and that ""there can be no winners,"" seems like a relic of the past. A proxy war between the nuclear powers is already underway; moreover, in the course of this conflict, more and more restrictions are being removed, both in terms of the weapon systems used and the participation of Western troops, as well as the geographical limits of the theater of war. It is possible to pretend that a certain 'strategic stability' is being maintained, but only if, like the US, a player sets the task of inflicting a strategic defeat on the enemy at the hands of its client state and expects that the enemy will not dare to use nuclear weapons.

Thus, the concept of strategic stability in its original form - the creation and maintenance of military-technical conditions to prevent a sudden massive nuclear strike - only partially retains its meaning under current conditions.

Strengthening nuclear deterrence could be the solution to the real task of restoring strategic stability, which has been seriously disrupted by the ongoing and escalating conflict. To begin with, it is worth rethinking the concept of deterrence and, in the process, changing its name. For example, instead of a passive form, we should talk about an active one. The adversary should not remain in a state of comfort, believing that the war he is waging with the help of another country will not affect him in any way. In other words, it is necessary to put fear back into the minds and hearts of the enemy's leaders. The beneficial sort of fear, it's worth stressing.

It must also be recognized that the limits of purely verbal intervention have been exhausted at this stage of the Ukrainian conflict. Channels of communication all the way to the top must remain open around the clock, but the most important messages at this stage must be sent through concrete actions: doctrinal changes; military exercises to test them; underwater and aerial patrols along the coasts of the likely enemy; warnings about preparations for nuclear tests and the tests themselves; the imposition of no-fly zones over part of the Black Sea, and so on. The point of these actions is not only to demonstrate determination and readiness to use available capabilities to protect Russia's vital interests, but -most importantly- to bring the enemy to a halt and encourage it to engage in serious dialogue.

The escalation ladder does not end here. Military technical steps can be followed by real actions, warnings of which have already been given: for example, attacks on air bases and supply centers on the territory of NATO countries, and so on. There is no need to go further. We simply need to understand, and help the enemy to understand, that strategic stability in the real, not narrow, technical sense of the word is not compatible with armed conflict between nuclear powers, even if (for the time being) it is being waged indirectly.

It is unlikely that the enemy will accept this state of affairs easily and immediately. At the very least, they will need to realize that this is our position and draw the appropriate conclusions. It is time for us to start revising the conceptual apparatus we use in matters of security strategy. We talk about international security, strategic stability, deterrence, arms control, nuclear non-proliferation and so on. These concepts emerged in the course of the development of Western - mainly American - political thought and found immediate practical application in US foreign policy.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on roadways throughout the city.

The storm was blamed for hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at New York-area airports, and it also postponed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

Due to reels and vlogs on social media, the craze for gulal gota has increased this year as orders have come from states like Delhi and West Bengal. However, the retail customers in Jaipur are still keeping their distance from this traditional toy due to the cost factor.

Besides, the families engaged in this work are unable to cater to the huge market.

TOI on Saturday visited Maniharon Ka Rasta, which is famous for bangles. This place becomes most sought after ahead of the festival of colours.

""This year, we were unable to complete all our orders as we have got demand from all over Rajasthan. We have even sent gulal gota boxes to states like Delhi and West Bengal. Thanks to the craze on the social media, especially among youths who are making reels and vlogs. We have even supplied gulal gota to former royal families in various parts of Rajasthan,"" said Amjad Khan, a manufacturer.

Khan said that gulal gota is in demand at Holi celebration functions of housing societies, business houses or corporate parties. ""We start making it just a month prior to the Holi festival as the material involved in it doesn't have shelf life more than a month,"" Khan added.

But why gulal gota is not available in retail shops outside the Walled city and why are there less takers?

""Firstly, we have a few families left which are engaged in this work. We can't cater to the needs of whole Jaipur in different localities. On the other hand, it is also a fact that the gulal gota is a little too expensive compared to the usual colors,"" said Abdul Majjid, another maker of gulal gota.

The condition is even worse in Dharwad and other parts of the twin cities, as power cuts have become so common that there are 5-10 minute outages every 1-2 hours, occurring 2-3 times daily. Some areas in the city are now experiencing long hours of power cuts..

In Dharwad, on Saturday, several areas including Madarmaddi, Kamankatti, and Bhusappa Chowk, among many others, faced severe power cut issues with no restoration of power from morning until evening. ""I tried to call the 1912 helpline on Saturday when the power went off suddenly around 10.30am, but it remained unanswered.

British rulers on March 23, 1931, hanged Bhagat Singh along with Raj Guru and Sukh Dev at Shadman Chowk here after trying them under the charge of hatching a conspiracy against the regime.

Bhagat Singh, respected across the subcontinent and not just by Sikhs and Hindus but also by Muslims, was initially jailed for life but later awarded death sentence in another ""fabricated case.""

Holding banners and chanting slogans, participants at the event held to observe the anniversary, demanded justice for Bhagat Singh.

Candles were lit at the Shadman Chowk to mark the occasion at the programme organised by the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation, Pakistan.

A resolution was also adopted during the event urging the Supreme Court to reopen the case of Singh and give him justice like it was done for Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

Bhutto was hanged through what many believe was a sham judicial trial more than 40 years ago.

Pakistan's parliament on March 13 passed a resolution, demanding the overturning of the death sentence given to Bhutto, also the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), who was executed by the military regime of Gen Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1979.

The resolution was passed a week after the Supreme Court on March 6 opined unanimously that the former premier did not receive a fair trial and due process in a much-anticipated review of the high-profile case.

On March 18, 1978, the Lahore High Court sentenced Bhutto to death for allegedly ordering the assassination of Ahmed Reza Kasuri, one of the founding members of the PPP.

On Saturday, during the event, the resolution also demanded Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to grant the status of ""national heroes"" to the trio and Bhagat Singh should be awarded Pakistan's top gallantry award too, both demands made in earlier years too.

The resolution also demanded the renaming of Shadman Chowk after Singh, a matter that is already sub-judice.

Speaking on the occasion, the Foundation's chairman advocate Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi said peace is the need of the hour between Pakistan and India that will benefit millions of people.

Qureshi said the government should recognise the sacrifices of the war heroes and said his Foundation would continue to fight Singh's case till he gets his due status here where he was hanged.

""On March 5, 2024, the reconstruction of hydro units at Toktogul and Uch-Kurgan hydroelectric power plants (HPP) began, resulting in a 290 MW decrease in the installed capacity of power stations,"" stated the ministry.

The primary goal of the reconstruction efforts were early preparation for the autumn-winter period of 2024-2025, as well as the reconstruction of worn-out hydro units at the Toktogul and Uch-Kurgan HPPs to assure the population's uninterrupted electricity supply. At the same time, it is required to improve HPP capacity.

Unit No. 1 of the Toktogul HPP was decommissioned for reconstruction on March 5, 2024. The capacity of the Toktogul HPP is planned to expand by 60 MW once unit No. 1 is fully rebuilt in 2024, increasing the overall capacity to 1,380 MW.

Starting on March 5, 2024, unit No. 4 of the Uch-Kurgan HPP has been withdrawn for reconstruction. Post-reconstruction, the capacity of this unit will witness a 20 percent increase. Currently, the total capacity of the Uch-Kurgan HPP stands at 180 MW. Upon completion of the reconstruction, the total capacity of the Uch-Kurgan HPP will rise to 216 MW, implying a 20 percent increase in the capacity of the HPP.

Just two years prior, the 22-year-old apprentice jockey was being actively discouraged from pursuing a career in racing by her jockey father who feared she would be hurt.

But after growing up around horses and working part-time in stables, she naturally gravitated towards a career in the saddle.

""I don't have the words yet; nothing describes the thrill of having a hometown cheer like that. People have been so good to me,"" Milnes said of her Cup win.

She was one of four female jockeys to compete in the main race that day, a telling sign of how far the industry has come in its attitudes towards women.

In South Australia alone, the number of female jockeys is continuing to grow, with the latest figures from the Australian Jockey Association showing that 58 per cent of all jockeys in the state are women.

For Milnes's part, when the Port Lincoln-born-and-bred rider took up her apprenticeship in 2022, she discovered an industry that was embracing women jockeys with gusto.

Women brought a love of the animals to the competitive and sometimes dangerous sport, Milnes says.

""The girls have a real passion for riding horses, so they come through and want to be jockeys, they're really interested in it, they love horses and that shows in their riding.

""I don't even really take notice anymore [of other women jockeys] because we're so common out there in the placings and the wins that it's a very level playing field.""

The first female jockeys in Australia had to disguise themselves as men, using pseudonyms and costumes to follow their sporting passion.

Today no such facade is necessary, with women dominating cohorts of licensed and apprentice jockeys across the nation.

In South Australia, of the 21 apprentice jockeys enrolled in Racing SA's program, just one is male. In Victoria, the most recent apprentice jockey intake saw 12 females and one male.

It's a sport that naturally lends itself to smaller bodies and is embracing women jockeys on a level playing field for the first time in its storied history.

Racing SA apprentice academy master and former jockey Briony Moore says gender is becoming irrelevant as a merit-based system takes hold.

""If a rider is going well and they're proving themselves on the track, then we're finding here in South Australia particularly that trainers are happy to put on who is in form and who's that right fit for the owners and the horse.""

Moore says female riders bring a different approach to the sport.

""I can't quite put my finger on it; maybe they are just that better body type and size for a jockey.

""Males typically would get into racing because they love the speed, the adrenaline, the lifestyle, the money.""

Female jockeys make up 36 per cent of the total number of jockeys and apprentices nationally, according to the Australian Jockey Association.

Tasmania has the highest ratio of female jockeys at 67 per cent, with South Australia second at 58 per cent.

In the past decade, the number of female jockeys has increased by 10 per cent.

It's a far cry from the experience of Australia's first licensed female jockey, Wilhemena ""Bill"" Smith, who gained success in the 1940s and '50s masquerading as a male rider, arriving at the races already dressed in her silks because she refused to change in front of other riders.

It was only in 1979 that women in Australia were given the right to legally race as jockeys against men.

At the Port Lincoln Racing Club (PLRC), the evolving gender makeup of the jockey cohort has forced changes.

When the change rooms were built in the 1990s, the men's rooms were substantially bigger than the women's.

In the past 12 months, those change rooms have been swapped over to cater to the large rise in female jockeys.

PLRC general manager Elouise Dukalskis says country clubs provide a supportive environment for women to rise through the ranks.

""It's a wonderful first step for people to interact with racing, perhaps find their feet, get their first job strapping, maybe get on a horse and do some track riding in the mornings.

""When someone like Rochelle Milnes, who is locally raised, comes through the ranks and takes out the Cup, there's not a dry eye in the house.""

For the young jockey's family who were initially against her pursing a career in racing, that moment ""was like magic"", according to her proud father.

""It was a great feeling, it was a magic moment for her. It really was,"" Graham Milnes said.

""She's had a lot of success, and it just shows the hard work that she's actually been putting in.""",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,0.2549019607843137,448932750,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0eb6892f35e8a405151b4d4d3a45229f?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=277&cropW=493&xPos=313&yPos=210&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,

Even before the match started, there were more than 50,000 IPL enthusiasts who trooped in to enjoy the first match of this season's IPL at Eden Gardens. The energy in the ground ebbed a little when the home team lost three early wickets.

""Yes, it was not the start we were hoping for though Phil Salt did hit three consecutive sixes. But we have a good batting line up and the score will be a formidable one,"" said another KKR fan in the stands. KKR did finish with a healthy total of 208 on board, which proved just enough for SRH.

Several fans who could not lay their hands on the tickets on time or wanted to plan for Holi watched the match at home. ""I had to buy a few things for Holi, so I decided to watch the match at home. But I will definitely be watching some of the KKR matches at the stadium in the coming weeks,"" said Kunal Shaw, a resident of Howrah Maidan.",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Zeeshan Javed,0.3490196078431373,448932508,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108740670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69644,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-9418077

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions Saturday. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens and delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt rollercoasters.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

Thakre, a former mayor of Nagpur, has a good ground-level rapport in his constituency. Thanks to his civic politics experience, his network spreads across the city. Thakre is counting on his personal connect as well as the dedicated Congress vote bank as he takes on BJP's Nitin Gadkari.

Thakre said it would be wrong to see this fight as him versus Gadkari. ""It's a battle of ideologies, not two individuals,"" said Thakre while speaking to TOI.

""On one hand you have BJP which wants to change the Constitution. On the other, you have Congress which will fiercely protect it. A BJP leader himself said that they need 400-plus MPs to bring in Constitutional amendments. This is a battle for saving democracy,"" said Thakre.

He added that people need to be made aware about the dangers that await if the secular fabric of the country is torn. ""The Constitution protects every democratic value. It protects the rights of citizens and keeps a check on the govt, so that it does not misuse its powers. So, if this is gone, then the public is left to fend for itself,"" said Thakre.

Thakre said that BJP is already misusing the power. ""Democratically elected CMs are being arrested,"" said Thakre, while referring to the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

""They are breaking up parties and houses of people for political gain. People have to decide if this is what they want. We must save the country from excesses, and that is what this Lok Sabha battle is about,"" said Thakre.

Regarding local issues, Thakre said, ""Later on, I will also talk about the last 10 years of Nagpur under Gadkari. Whether the city has gained or lost. I will hold a detailed discussion and bring out the facts.""

Power-Cassidy's Holy Cross team met the Hawkeyes in NCAA Women's March Madness today.

March Madness is the name given to the mammoth college basketball tournament currently going on with 68 teams vying their way to become National Champions.

Coolock native Power-Cassidy is a senior for the Holy Cross Crusaders, a college from Worcester, Massachusetts.

She has been a star player for the Crusaders this year, averaging over 16 points a game so far this season and picking up a plethora of accolades.

However, she faced the toughest test of her young career tonight.

In the first round of March Madness Holy Cross were pitted against powerhouse Iowa Hawkeyes who are led by Caitlin Clark. Clark is one of the biggest names in American sport at the moment with many saying she could be the greatest college player of all-time. To put it in simple terms, she's the LeBron James of women's college basketball. She has scored more points than any player - male or female - in college basketball history and is a wizard from long range.

Therefore it was always going to be a daunting task for Holy Cross to upset the Hawkeyes but Power-Cassidy held her own right during the first half of the contest.

Bronagh Power-Cassidy scored 17 points in the first half including four three pointers, even more impressive when you consider Clark is famed for her three point capabilities and she was held to just one three pointer in the first half.

Power-Cassidy did find herself in the middle of a social media storm for a foul on Clark in the first half, when she accidentally elbowed the star.

There was plenty over OTT reaction from certain corners of social media, with some accusing the Ireland international of deliberately trying to injury Clark.

Power-Cassidy apologised for the incident to Clark in the immediate aftermath, and apologised again in the post-game press conference.

She explained after the game that she had broken her hand in a game last week and was hoping to avoid contact with that hand.

""When I was moving, I just conscious of keeping it out of the way of too much contact...It wasn't intentional at all and she [Clark] was a great sport about understanding.""

Although they are very different phenomena, they are caused by the same celestial alignment.

A lunar eclipse happens when Earth's shadow is projected onto the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light and causes a shadow on Earth. However, both types of eclipses are rare because the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun are subtly different.

A lunar eclipse can only happen at a full moon, when Earth is between the sun and the moon and projects a shadow into space. Full moons happen every 29 days, of course, but the moon rarely passes through Earth's shadow. When it does, that's a lunar eclipse.

A solar eclipse can only happen at a new moon, when the moon is between the sun and Earth and projects a shadow onto Earth. A new moon happens every 29 days -- two weeks after a full moon -- but rarely does the moon block the sun as seen from Earth. When it does, that's a solar eclipse.

A perfect alignment of the sun, Earth and moon. Earth has two shadows -- its fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and its dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon drifts into Earth's umbra, it receives no direct light from the sun. The only light on its surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. The effect is a thousand sunsets on the lunar surface, which turns a pinkish-red for a short time -- a ""Blood Moon."" If you were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would be bathed in pinkish-red light and see a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, there will be a penumbral lunar eclipse because the full ""Worm Moon"" will only move through Earth's penumbra.

A perfect alignment of sun, moon and Earth -- and a celestial fluke -- are what cause a total eclipse of the sun. A new moon has two shadows -- its fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and dark central umbral shadow. When a new moon perfectly blocks all of the sun -- something it can only do because it just happens to be 400 times smaller than the sun but also 400 times closer to Earth -- its umbra is projected onto Earth.

This shadow of the moon moves across Earth's surface because it's orbiting from west to east. That's also the direction that Earth rotates, which slows down the movement of the moon's shadow. It creates an umbral shadow -- a path of totality -- that those within can see something incredible: a total eclipse of the sun. If you were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would see the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, there will be a total solar eclipse because the new ""Pink Moon"" will block the sun perfectly and project an umbral shadow over North America.

Eclipses of all kinds are relatively rare because the moon's orbit around Earth is tilted about 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. That means the moon's path through the sky intersects the sun twice in each orbit -- each month -- but it must be at its new or full phase to cause a solar or a lunar eclipse. This scenario happens twice yearly, creating two ""eclipse seasons"" when solar and lunar eclipses always occur. However, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

There will be two ""eclipse seasons"" in 2024, starting on March 25 and September 17:

A solar eclipse happens during a New Moon as it passes in front of the Sun, coming in total and partial forms. Conversely, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth interposes between the Sun and Moon at Full Moon. While the frequency of eclipses globally is not markedly low -- with about six or seven each year -- the odds of experiencing a total solar eclipse like the one in Kingston, which hadn't been seen in seven centuries, are remarkably slim.

The scarcity of total solar eclipses in any given location is due to the narrow path of the eclipse's shadow on Earth and the vastness of our planet's surface. Most eclipse paths track over water, making the spectacle of totality even more exceptional for those on land. The visual difference between a near total solar eclipse and a total one is significant as well; a 95% obscured Sun doesn't compare to the arresting sight of a 100% eclipse.

Eye protection with solar filters is imperative when watching these phenomena to prevent damage to the eyes because, whereas the Sun is usually too intense to gaze at directly, eclipses can dangerously tempt observers to look without reflexive aversion.

In summary, eclipses, be they solar or lunar, are not extremely rare overall, but witnessing a total solar eclipse at any specific point on Earth is. Therefore, such occasions are momentous, urging the need for caution and proper viewing equipment to safeguard one's vision.

Eclipses are not just fascinating natural spectacles, but they also offer significant opportunities for various industries. For the tourism sector, eclipses have become a boon. There is a rising market for eclipse tourism, where enthusiasts travel to prime viewing locations, driving local economies with their spending on hotels, restaurants, and other services. Industry analysts forecast continued growth in this niche market as both seasoned and newfound astronomy enthusiasts seek to witness these rare events.

Scientific equipment manufacturers also benefit from eclipses. There is a surge in demand for specialized equipment such as solar filters, telescopes, and protective eyewear in the run-up to an eclipse. Market forecasts suggest robust sales cycles in alignment with major upcoming eclipses. Companies specializing in this area are preparing for expansions, both in terms of product offerings and geographic reach.

Educational aspects are significant since eclipses present hands-on learning experiences. Educational institutions and science communicators leverage these events to engage the public and students with space science, leading to a deeper public interest in astronomy.

However, eclipses also bring up issues regarding public safety and misinformation. Eye safety is paramount when viewing solar eclipses, and there have been campaigns to raise awareness about the proper methods of eclipse observation. High-quality solar viewing glasses and filters are essential, and demand for these products spikes around eclipse dates. Responsible vendors and scientific organizations are collaborating to ensure that information and safety equipment are widely available.

Within the realm of potential issues, there's also the risk of counterfeit or substandard viewing equipment entering the market, which can have serious repercussions for uninformed consumers. Regulatory bodies and industry leaders are called upon to address these concerns proactively.

For those interested in learning more about eclipses, an authoritative source is the official website of NASA, which provides information on upcoming eclipses, viewing tips, and the science behind these events. You can visit the NASA website for detailed information on eclipses and related subjects.

In conclusion, while eclipses themselves might not be exceedingly rare, total solar eclipses at any single geographic point on Earth are infrequent, making them precious occurrences for both observers and the industries that revolve around these celestial events. From fostering tourism and boosting scientific equipment sales to providing educational avenues and raising public awareness about eye safety, eclipses impact an array of sectors and concerns. Looking ahead, the market related to eclipses seems set for continued expansion as public interest grows and industries evolve to meet the demands of these awe-inspiring cosmic phenomena.",ytech.news,news,yTech,Marcin Frąckiewicz,0.2470588235294118,448931111,1,https://ytech.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/compressed_img-inmN4B6f3xjzdWqEVXFRvOCj.png,eng-9413446

(KNWA/KFTA) -- Sonic Drive-In recently unveiled a new menu item to give fans an ""out-of-this-world experience"" ahead of the total solar eclipse on April 8, according to a news release.

The fast food chain announced the new Blackout Slush Float will be available at locations nationwide starting on March 25 for a limited time.

The all-black slush, meant to represent the temporary darkness from the solar eclipse, is cotton candy and dragonfruit flavored and topped with ice cream.

A pair of solar eclipse glasses comes with each purchase of the Blackout Slush Float, while supplies last, according to Sonic.

""There are over 400 Sonic locations in areas where the total solar eclipse will be visible, and we thought, what better way to create some fun for our fans as they experience this unique event than by introducing a new treat that's as awe-inspiring as the eclipse itself?""

The moon will be extra close to Earth, providing a long and intense period of darkness, and the sun should be more active with the potential for dramatic bursts of plasma. Then there's totality's densely populated corridor stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada.

Hundreds if not thousands of the tens of millions of spectators will double as ""citizen scientists,"" helping NASA and other research groups better understand our planet and star.

They'll photograph the sun's outer crownlike atmosphere, or corona, as the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blotting out sunlight for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds on April 8. They'll observe the quieting of birds and other animals as midday darkness falls. They'll also measure dropping temperatures, monitor clouds and use ham radios to gauge communication disruptions.

At the same time, rockets will blast off with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere. The small rockets will soar from Wallops Island, Virginia -- some 400 miles outside totality but with 81% of the sun obscured in a partial eclipse. Similar launches were conducted from New Mexico during last October's ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse that swept across the western U.S. and Central and South America.

""Time for the biggie! It is pretty exciting!!!"" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Aroh Barjatya, the rockets' mission director, said in an email.

NASA's high-altitude jets also will take to the air again, chasing the moon's shadow with improved telescopes to study the sun's corona and surrounding dust.

""Dust sounds boring,"" acknowledged NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck. ""But at the same time, dust is actually really interesting. Those are the leftover remnants from when the solar system was forming.""

More than 600 weather balloons will be launched by college students along the track, providing livestreams while studying atmospheric changes. Cloudy skies shouldn't matter.

""Lucky for us, the balloons flying to 80,000 feet and above don't care if it's cloudy on the ground,"" said Angela Des Jardins, an astrophysicist at Montana State University who's coordinating the nationwide project.

And if the Federal Aviation Administration approves, a 21-foot (6.5-meter) kite will lift a science instrument three miles (5 kilometers) above Texas in an experiment by the University of Hawaii's Shadia Habbal. She, too, wants to get above any clouds that might hamper her observations of the sun.

Normally hidden by the sun's glare, the corona is on full display during a total solar eclipse, making it a prime research target. The spiky tendrils emanating thousands of miles (kilometers) into space are mystifyingly hotter than the sun's surface -- in the millions of degrees, versus thousands.

""In terms of the value of total eclipses, science still cannot explain how the corona is heated to such extreme temperatures,"" said retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak, better known as Mr. Eclipse for all his charts and books on the subject.

The U.S. won't see another total solar eclipse on this scale until 2045, so NASA and everyone else is pulling out all the stops.

April's eclipse will begin in the Pacific and make landfall at Mazatlan, Mexico, heading up through Texas and 14 other U.S. states before crossing into Canada and exiting into the Atlantic at Newfoundland. Those outside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path, will get a partial eclipse.

Scientists got a taste of what's to come during the 2017 total solar eclipse that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. This time, the moon is closer to Earth, resulting in more minutes of darkness and a wider path.

""Any time we can observe for longer, that gives scientists more data,"" Korreck said.

Another scientific bonus this time: The sun will be just a year away from its maximum solar activity, as opposed to 2017 when it was near its minimum. That means lots more action at the sun, possibly even a coronal mass ejection during the eclipse, with massive amounts of plasma and magnetic field blasted into space.

Plus there are two new spacecraft out there studying the sun: NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter. They'll join other spacecraft on eclipse duty, including the International Space Station and its astronauts.

Closer to home, April's eclipse, unlike previous ones, will pass over three U.S. radar sites typically used for monitoring space weather. The stations will tune in to what's happening in the upper atmosphere as the skies dim.

New England is battling a mix of wind, rain, sleet and heavy snow across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski county, but mostly rain, wind and possible flooding [...]

BOSTON (AP) -- It may officially be spring, but New England was battling a wintry weather combination across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski country, and rain, wind and possible flooding in southern areas and along the coast.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on roadways throughout the city.

The storm was blamed for hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at New York-area airports, and it also postponed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

News","Adaora Onyechere Sydney-Jack, author of 'Politics, X and Power speaking to journalists at the event

Dr. Adaora Onyechere Sydney-Jack, author of 'Politics, X and Power, a critical book on the Nigerian politics has said she wrote the book to underscore the shrinking opportunities for women participation in politics in Nigeria.

The popular broadcast journalist, gender activist and Executive Director of Gender Strategy Advancement International (GSAI), made this disclosure recently in Abuja at the public presentation of the book many have described as bold, provocative and revealing.

She said she once aspired to represent her people in the House of Representatives in 2019, but learnt firsthand, how frustrating and suffocating politics in Nigeria could be, especially for women, irrespective of their leadership capacity and talent.

Addressing the book, the author, Sydney-Jack said she ventured into politics with the view to bridge the gap between the leadership and the led but find herself in the murky water of politics.

""With every chapter, I can tell you that I wrote this book out of my deep concern for the shrinking spaces for women's participation, the looming resignation and the distorted and negative gender identities emboldened by socialisation for a long period of time,"" Adaora said,

Speaking further at the book presentation, she said, ""I wrote this book not just as a reference to every individual who believes that for Nigeria, full circle means to have a country where everyone counts and all citizens have a true stake, but to revisit our convictions of who we can be,"" she said.

Giving more insight about what motivated her to write the book, she said, ""Interestingly this book was already in pictures in my mind's eye after daring to run in the 2019 elections, which I call baptism of fire, wind and rain.

""A journey I refer to as the uncovering of the wool over my eyes, especially as I journeyed between two worlds -- that of active journalism and the underbelly of politics -- where I experienced a complex variety of a new kind of participation which were previously unknown to me as a broadcast journalist.""

Stakeholders at the event also echoed her concerns, adding that stereotyping, negative perception were some of the factors hindering participation of women in politics in Nigeria.

According to them, more Nigerian women would participate in politics when negative stereotypes, perception and other challenges are eliminate.

They assured that when this is done, there would be more representation and participation of women in leadership positions.

In her remarks, one of the stakeholders, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, called for more participation of women in leadership roles, saying God has prepared them for such assignments.

The minister said women must be treated with all sense of responsibility and equality.

""For me, women should be treated with all sense of responsibility,"" she said

""We are very important people created by God and we should not be put down either in politics or power.""

She said the increased participation of women in politics would enable them to occupy their rightful positions anywhere they find themselves.

On her part, the book reviewer, Amina Salihu, noted that until men shift ground and make sacrifices by giving chance and space to women, fifty ( 50) percent of its population will not be able to meet their potentials, which is counter productive for the development of the country.

She said, ""Nobody holds down fifty of their population which is women and you hope to make progress. The person held down, the person holding down, everybody will be performing at less of their optimum.""

In his address, the keynote speaker, the Director General of the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Abubakar Suleiman, noted that some of the challenge in achieving true gender parity in politics include patriarchy (cultural barriers), deep-rooted stereotypes and biases against women, financial constraints, among others.

However, he continued, as societies evolve and progress over time, a push for greater gender equality in politics from official and unofficial quarters such as the book written by Sydney-Jack, has resulted in more women breaking barriers and assuming leadership positions previously limited to men.

Commenting on the book, he stated, ""First, though there are many books that seek to address politics and power, Adaora's is quite truly uncommon and unique. Predicated upon the gender perspective, the book is unarguably refreshing, going beyond the smokescreen to demonstrate the intricate connections of women, sex and power relation in the governance framework of our society. The book challenges us to think critically about the nature of power, its manifestations, as well as the manipulations of sex as an instrument of political domination in various political systems, and its impact on society at large,"" Abubakar said.

Former Imo State Governor, Emeka Ihedioha, in his remarks, asked women to be more supportive to the cause of their fellow women.

He noted, ""Oftentimes, when a lady contests for election, I will use the case of Sarah Jubril for instance. She came to run for President. The Minister of Women Affairs voted against her at the convention. I am sure women leader, if you have that opportunity, you may do the same today.""

The Pac-12's demise in August was followed by the football season, the laborious but ultimately successful legal fight against the 10 departing schools, scheduling arrangements with the Mountain West and West Coast Conference and, finally, two very different experiences for the respective men's basketball programs.

But for plot twists and emotional turns, the eight days that concluded Friday are tough to beat. The stretch began with crushing news and a bleak financial situation and ended with an unexpected pot of cash.

The schools improved their financial situation by more than $30 million in that short timeframe.

Let's recount the eight days, step by step.

It was anything but a quiet Friday as late-morning media reports sent shockwaves through Pullman and Corvallis.

The College Football Playoff's revenue distribution model, which allocated varying amounts to the conferences, had relegated WSU and OSU to fourth-rate status.

The two schools were treated as Independents and reportedly assigned annual shares of $360,000 each for the six years of the contract cycle (2026-31).

That was just 20 percent of the $1.8 million shares negotiated for each Group of Five school (think: Boise State, Tulane, Akron, etc.), and it was roughly 95 percent less than the amount WSU and OSU collect currently as members of the Pac-12.

This, while every other FBS school would receive a substantial increase in CFP revenue from the new, $1.3 billion annual deal with ESPN.

Multiple industry sources were aghast at the treatment of the two schools.

Meanwhile, the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament were scheduled for that evening, with Arizona facing Oregon and Washington State playing Colorado.

The financial outlook for WSU and OSU on the court? Somewhat gloomy.

Victories by the top-seeded Wildcats and second-seeded Cougars likely would result in the conference sending only those two teams to the NCAA Tournament.

With each March Madness game carrying a value of $2 million in future revenue, the semifinal pairings suggested two bids for the conference and, therefore, just $4 million in guaranteed cash for the 'Pac-2' schools.

By Friday night, the on-court outlook had improved dramatically, with victories by Colorado and Oregon pushing the Pac-12 closer to additional berths.

When the brackets were revealed on Selection Sunday, the conference had secured four bids -- the maximum available under the circumstances.

Oregon claimed the automatic bid (by winning the tournament) while Colorado joined Arizona and WSU in the at-large field, albeit barely. The Buffaloes were the third-to-last team voted into the event.

Even if all four schools lost their NCAA openers, the Pac-12 would have four units at $2 million each. The Cougars and Beavers were now guaranteed $8 million in future revenue.

A double dose of good news arrived Tuesday.

First, the College Football Playoff revenue distribution model was finalized, and -- presto! -- it featured larger shares for WSU and OSU. Substantially larger shares, in fact.

Instead of just $360,000 per school per year for six years, the Cougars and Beavers would collect $3.6 million annually for the first three years (2026-28) of the contract.

Exactly what was said in the private discussions between Pac-12 commissioner Teresa Gould and her colleagues remains a mystery. But the end result was a 10-fold increase for the Cougars and Beavers during the first half of the contract term. (The distributions for the final three years are unknown.)

But an increase in CFP revenue wasn't the only encouraging development Tuesday for WSU and OSU.

Thunderous news surfaced in the ACC, where Clemson filed a lawsuit against the conference in an attempt to invalidate the grant-of-rights contract holding the ACC together.

The lawsuit came three months after the ACC's other football powerhouse, Florida State, initiated legal proceedings against the conference.

The lawsuits make different claims, but the end goal is the same: The Tigers and Seminoles want to obliterate the ACC's contract so they can pursue membership in the SEC or Big Ten.

And anything that creates more realignment at the power conference level is good news for the Cougars and Beavers.

If the ACC dissolves, Cal and Stanford, which are scheduled to enter the conference this summer, might be forced to join Washington State and Oregon State in rebuilding the Pac-12.

If the ACC dissolves, the Big 12 might become a receptacle for all schools that don't gain membership in the Big Ten or SEC.

If the ACC dissolves, the top football schools in every conference could form a super league of 24 or 32 teams and leave everyone else behind -- thus placing WSU and OSU on the same level as dozens of second-tier football schools that are currently in the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and SEC.

Uncertainty over the structure of the sport is the building block of the 'Pac-2' strategy: Remain as flexible as possible for as long as possible in case everything crumbles and opportunities surface.

There was even better news for WSU and OSU the next day, March 20, when the chair of North Carolina's Board of Trustees told Inside Carolina: ""I think that what Clemson is doing is 100 percent proof positive that a significant portion of the (ACC) membership of the conference is unhappy.""

The start of March Madness brought more good news for the Cougars and Beavers, as all four Pac-12 teams won their first-round games. Add Colorado's victory in the First Four, and the conference was guaranteed at least nine games.

With each game (i.e., unit) equalling $2 million over the course of the six-year payout window, the 'Pac-2' schools were suddenly staring at $18 million in guaranteed cash -- a huge uptick from the situation as it stood prior to the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament.

In fact, the NCAA Tournament results and the change in College Football Playoff revenue produced a windfall for WSU and OSU over just eight days.

NCAA Tournament revenue: With only two teams assured of making the field (two units), the conference could count on just $4 million.

CFP revenue shares: With $360,000 annual shares over six years for two teams, that meant just $4.3 million for the Pac-12 coffers.

NCAA Tournament revenue: With four teams winning five games (nine units), the conference is guaranteed at least $18 million.

CFP revenue shares: With $3.6 million annually for three years for two teams, the total climbs to $21.6 million.

Total: $39.6 million

In other words, Washington State and Oregon State increased their guaranteed revenue by $31.3 million from Friday morning of one week to Friday night of the next.

And the total will grow by $2 million with each subsequent NCAA victory. (Arizona defeated Dayton on Saturday, pushing the unit count to 10.)

That said, the NCAA revenue is contingent on Pac-12 survival. If the conference dissolves or if it becomes a different legal entity, a source said, the revenue earned this month will be split evenly among the 12 current schools, regardless of future conference affiliations.

Also, any additional members of the Pac-12 -- if we assume WSU and OSU pursue expansion in some form -- might attempt to negotiate access to a portion of the NCAA units.

And it's unclear how the CFP would handle revenue distributions if a Pac-8 or Pac-10 were to emerge in a few years, with schools from the Mountain West or other conferences.

The past eight days did nothing to solve the riddle of what comes next for WSU and OSU. But the wild week clearly unfolded in a favorable, and lucrative, fashion for the two schools.",spokesman.com,news,The Spokesman Review,,0.1372549019607843,448930674,1,https://thumb.spokesman.com/VyLJoF_j_bPaaEYrQ_nKlPi7u0E=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/03/23/65ff58b03d28f.hires.jpg,

New Delhi: Slamming Congress for alleging that its accounts were frozen because of political vendetta, BJP on Saturday said no one can indulge in corruption and then demand immunity ""in the name of level playing field"". ""You are corrupt and then expect agencies to not carry out investigations against you just because you are a political party heading into election,"" said BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra at a press conference.

The governing party said Congress has multiple bank accounts and just three-four of them have been attached, ""not frozen"", for non-payment of tax dues and accused the opposition party of making misleading statements on the issue sensing its ""imminent"" defeat in Lok Sabha poll.

""These bank accounts have not been frozen, they are operational. You (Congress) can deposit money in these accounts and withdraw too, except Rs 125 crore, which has been attached by income tax department due to the non-payment of dues as per Income Tax rules,"" Patra said.

Addressing the presser with Patra, another party spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam asserted that Congressn consistently approached various courts and tribunals regarding the income tax case but faced defeat.

Patra said Congress has about Rs 1,000 crore in its multiple bank accounts, opened with ""multiple PAN"" numbers in ""violation of its own party constitution"". Congress also has a fixed asset of worth Rs 500 crore, the BJP leader claimed.

He slammed Rahul Gandhi for his claim that the party doesn't have funds to even book train ticket.

""Rahul Gandhi is saying there is no money with Congress to even buy train tickets while he is seen travelling by chartered plane every day,"" the BJP leader charged and demanded the Congress leader give a ""technical answer, instead of political"" on the issue.",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,,0.0117647058823529,448930386,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108739951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-10746,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-9413289

The government has implemented a rebate programme to support local fishermen and strengthen the resilience of the fisheries sector against fluctuating fuel prices.

Fishermen across Saint Lucia have started receiving increased fuel rebates as pledged in the 2023/2024 budget address, signalling a tangible commitment by the Government of Saint Lucia to support the fisheries sector and promote sustainable livelihoods for fisher-folk.

A release from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) states that the Philip J Pierre Administration's enhanced rebate programme will provide much-needed financial relief that our fishermen deserve.

Revenue from the rebate will bolster food security, reduce the operating costs associated with fishing and safeguard the livelihoods of our fishermen.

The increased fuel rebates for fisher - folk takes effect as government endeavours to alleviate financial strain and ensure the continued viability of small-scale fishermen.

Commenting on the benefits of this initiative, Andre Miller, a Vieux Fort fisherman, captain and boat owner with 43 years' experience said: ""Going fishing is like taking 'dry money' and going and wet it, because you don't know what you will get on that day or what you will come back on shore with."" He argued that ""sometimes you go for three or four days and you haven't got nothing""

On an average, Miller explained, fishermen spend at least $300 to $750 per expedition, since they go to sea with four 15 gallons of gas and have to purchase oil, as well.

He continued that right now, we don't have control over fuel, we don't produce fuel in Saint Lucia, and we cannot blame the government for fuel prices. So we have to take it the way it is since the cost of living is going up around the world.

Speaking on behalf of the fisherfolks, Miller says they are grateful for this latest incentive from the government ""for thinking of fishermen and giving that dollar rebate on every gallon of gas right now it is very timely and fishermen appreciate that.

I think they will come, because we will prove it out,"" he told The Australian Financial Review.

""What this will do, on its own, will really move the needle, a whole new industry will kickstart.""

He said the eventual laying of more of these inter-regional cables, like Xlinks and Sun Cable's AAPowerLink connecting the Northern Territory and Singapore, would change the face of the transition to renewables.

""Once you start sharing power between regions, and you operate a global grid in the same way as you have a more local grid, bingo: that just solves so much of the issue that we face,"" he said. ""I think this long-distance energy transfer will solve the whole intermittency of renewables.""

His shiny optimism could reflect onto Sun Cable's $40 billion plan. Even though the two projects are apple-and-orange in their geographies and practicalities, Xlinks's progress seems to suggest there is a viable commercial route to building long, international undersea energy cables.

Mr Morrish argues that Europe, at least, will eventually work out that hydrogen - with its electrolysers, compression, transport, storage and fuel cells or turbines - simply cannot deliver electricity as efficiently as cables.

""Effectively, if you do it through hydrogen, your round-trip efficiency for hydrogen is less than 30 per cent. Ours is 85 per cent,"" he said. ""We're about three times more efficient than hydrogen in terms of converting back into electrons, at about similar a capex. So we're a third of the cost of hydrogen.""

Xlinks was founded in 2019, a year after Sun Cable. But it has several advantages: its route lies in shallower waters; it added wind to its solar farm, because the two are highly complementary in Morocco; and it began with a different cable configuration.

It did not have deep-pocketed billionaires like Mr Cannon-Brookes and Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest behind it. But its backers including TotalEnergies, the Abu Dhabi national energy company, and British disrupter Octopus Energy, which is part-owned by Australia's Origin Energy.

Mr Morrish said he wanted to see the Australian project - which is now in the midst of subsea mapping, regulatory approvals, customer negotiations and investor discussions - get up and running.

""We're trying to build an incredibly ambitious project, which whilst the individual components themselves are not technically difficult, actually putting them all together, that is the complexity and the challenge,"" he said. ""Unselfishly, the more the merrier.""

Mr Morrish said Xlinks had lined up about 70 per cent of the £8 billion of equity it would need for the construction phase. And although many renewables projects were struggling to procure the kit they needed to build out solar farms, he was also confident on this score.

""We were slightly nervous before we started it in terms of how many players would be stepping up, able to and wanting to do this. We're now very comfortable that we're there on all the different procurement packages,"" he said.

""We've got multiple competition from multiple vendors, and all confident that this can be produced in the timeframes that we're looking for. So actually, we're in a good place on that.""

AAPowerLink, having come through the fracas between Mr Cannon-Brookes and Dr Forrest last year, is looking to solve some of those challenges in-house. Last November, it said it would build a plant in Tasmania to make advanced high voltage subsea cables, to overcome the problem that all other potential suppliers are in the Northern Hemisphere.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.2941176470588236,448930363,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3132%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_640%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/a21c4006f7a217e4f95ffc00f64f34c00f05a8da,

BOSTON (AP) -- It may officially be spring, but New England was battling a wintry weather combination across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski country, and rain, wind and possible flooding in southern areas and along the coast.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on roadways throughout the city.

The storm was blamed for hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at New York-area airports, and it also postponed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

A handful of Bay State fishermen advocacy groups are teaming with counterparts from across New England in criticizing the Biden administration's plans to industrialize the area off the coasts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine.

The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management finalized the designation earlier this month, an action it says looks to support President Biden's clean energy goals.

The area, which ranges from 23 to 92 miles off the coasts of the three states, has the potential to support generation of 32 gigawatts of clean energy, the bureau said. That amount of energy surpasses ""current state goals for offshore wind energy in the Gulf of Maine: 10 GW for Massachusetts and 3 GW for Maine,"" BOEM said.

Specifically, industrialization could lead to the deployment of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy capacity by 2035, according to the feds.

Local, state and federal officials over the years have mandated fishermen to follow a growing number of protocols to preserve the endangered right whales -- in some cases, barring them from taking to certain waters.

Fishermen, however, say the industrialization of the two-million-acre area is ""flatly inconsistent with a policy of endangered species protection.""

""Fishermen are disheartened that the WEA designation favors foreign energy developers over marine mammal protection,"" the Gulf of Maine Fishing Associations said in a statement last week. ""This preferential treatment is in stark contrast to the federal government's aggressive campaign to burden commercial fishing needlessly with crushing restrictions to protect whales.""

The Bay State group's part of the coalition include the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance; Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Association; Massachusetts Fishermen's Partnership; Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association; and Massachusetts Seafood Collaborative.

Initially, the feds looked to industrialize a much larger zone in the Gulf of Maine, but feedback from local residents, fishermen and other stakeholders led to a 80% reduction in the final designation for possible leasing.

""The resulting (wind energy area) avoids important areas for lobster fishing, North Atlantic right whale habitat, and other important fishing areas and habitats,"" the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management stated in a release.

Katie Sinding Daly, senior vice president of law and policy at the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation, said she believes the feds ""did a thorough job of listening to concerns about protecting marine life.""

""CLF will continue to work with BOEM to ensure all possible protections for vulnerable marine wildlife and important habitats are built into the process as it moves toward leasing and construction of these floating turbines,"" Daly said in a statement.

The designation continues a years-long effort by environmentalists to make offshore wind turbines a major source of power, with initial efforts in Massachusetts focused on areas south of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The newly designated zone lies to the east of the state.

Fishermen acknowledged the improvements in the final designation but concerns remain around whether the offshore wind development will directly imperil ""commercial fishing, sensitive habitats, and maritime communities that depend on the fishing industry.""

The designation came a day after a federal judge ruled that the National Marine Fisheries Service was not in the right when it added a 200-square-mile wedge between state and federal waters to an existing closure that stretches roughly 9,000 square miles off the Massachusetts coast.

The closure, in effect from February to the end of April, is viewed as a measure to protect right whales.

There are less than 360 right whales left in the ocean, including 70 reproductively active females.

Federal officials and scientific agencies say climate change is the biggest threat to the right whale contrary to a belief from opponents that offshore wind projects are to blame for a spate of whale deaths over the past year-plus on the East Coast.

Many have been struck by ships or become entangled in fishing gear, the leading causes of death, environmentalists say.

A female calf was found dead off of Martha's Vineyard in late January, with officials reporting a rope was entangled around its tail. Weeks later, a New England Aquarium aerial survey team counted 31 right whales in shipping lanes east of Nantucket.

BOEM and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released final plans in January to protect the endangered species, including a strategy that would use artificial intelligence and passive acoustic monitoring to determine where the whales are at a given time and to monitor the impacts of wind development on the animals.

Angela Sanfilippo, president of the Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Association urged the feds to proceed with caution in developing the Gulf of Maine designation based on how the construction and operation of the wind farms could further threaten the right whale.

""The noise and disruption caused by such developments are not fully understood, but they have the potential to affect the migration, feeding, and breeding patterns of these whales,"" she wrote in a letter last November to BOEM. ""The uncertainty surrounding these impacts calls for a cautious approach, considering the critical status of the right whale population.""",bostonherald.com,news,Boston Herald,Lance Reynolds,0.3333333333333333,448930093,1,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Right_Whale_Deaths_19385.jpg?w=640,

Mitchell's birdie on hole 12 shifted him into gear and further birdies on holes 14, 16 and 17 set him up for a fantastic eagle on the last to rocket him to the top of the pile.

Malnati shot 68 and overnight co-leader Hughes 69 to share second with Power on eight under.

Labor led with 39%.

There is one major caveat: Deltapoll's sample was tiny, with just over 100 voters from Wales in a UK-wide poll, so firm conclusions cannot be drawn. But it's worth making two points. The level of support shown for reform in Wales was higher than in any other region of Britain.

And lest we refuse to believe that the people of progressive Wales would vote in such large numbers for a party to the right of the Conservatives, we must remember that Reform UK's former name was the Brexit Party, which in 2019 was topped the polls in Wales when we voted. last elections to the European Parliament before Brexit with 32.46% of the votes.

There is something else to say. Who would believe, looking at the official photo of the Vaughan Gethings cabinet outside the Welsh Government headquarters at Cathays Park, that this was a happy and enthusiastic team, eagerly anticipating the challenges ahead and knowing that d Within a few months, they would be working in tandem. with a new Labor government at Westminster?

The only one who really smiles is Lynne Neagle, who, when she was first elected in 1999, could never have dreamed that she would one day find herself at the head of the Education portfolio.

Discomfort

The fact is, as we know, most members of the Cabinet would prefer Mr. Gething not to be Prime Minister and, even if for one reason or another they agreed to serve under him, they feel a great feeling of unease, even disgust, in the face of this decision. the way he was elected, with a $200,000 donation from a convicted felon. They know that this problem is not going to go away and that it will haunt Mr. Gething in the same way that Partygate haunted Boris Johnson.

None of them doubt that Labor will win the general election later this year, but they understand that Keir Starmer's presence in Downing Street will deprive them of the ability to blame Westminster whenever things go wrong.

While Wales' performance in the three crucial policy areas of health, education and the economy has undoubtedly been disappointing throughout the period of devolution, each of the three previous Prime Ministers - Rhodri Morgan , Carwyn Jones and Mark Drakeford - demonstrated individual leadership skills which, for the most part, allowed them to mitigate the damage to Welsh Labour's reputation.

They have also been helped by the absence of credible opposition and by a major event like Covid which, whatever the serious errors which are now becoming evident, has allowed Mr Drakeford to display a reassuring professorial style contrasting with the offbeat flamboyance of Boris Johnson.

Mr. Gething's rise to power has deprived him of any similar political credentials, and he can expect to take the full brunt of criticism from wherever it comes.

Embarrassment

For several years, Wales' poor performance in the international PISA tables which measure the basic educational skills of adolescents has been embarrassing. Things have now gotten worse, with a devastating report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies stating in no uncertain terms that school education reforms in Wales have failed and must be reversed.

Mr Gething's decision to put Ms Neagle, a political novice, in charge suggests no willingness to take the criticism seriously and do anything about it. It will be Mr Gething, as well as Ms Neagle, who will be criticized.

We will also have to see what impact the new Prime Minister can have on the ongoing crises facing the NHS in Wales, both in terms of waiting times and the performance of individual units which are far from up to par. expectations and in some cases are not trusted to lead themselves. As the next Senedd elections approach in 2026, these issues will take on increased political importance.

In the short term, Mr Gething faces the likelihood of a legal challenge to the Welsh Government's Senedd reform plans regarding gender balance and gender self-identification. His choice may come down to performative politics (making a grand gesture while secretly accepting that you will lose) or political expediency (turning around and annoying the people you were trying to please), both of which have their drawbacks.

It is after Labor's victory in the general election that a new dynamic will emerge in British politics. It is likely that Labor will win with a large majority, allowing the party to implement whatever plans it wants without fear of being ambushed by its opponents.

Expectations will be high about what can be achieved, with people hoping for a short-term improvement in their living standards. Yet statements made by Keir Starmer and his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves suggest there will be no radical change.

Along with other Labor politicians, they spouted economically illiterate Tory mantras like There is no magic money tree and We have maxed out the country's credit card, with the clear intention of justifying the continuation of the austerity and dampen the hope of real change.

Margaret Thatcher

At the same time, we saw Margaret Thatcher hailed by members of the shadow cabinet as a visionary and mourned heroine of the past. Such rhetoric is not aimed at Welsh Labor's core supporters in the Valleys communities, nor even at its middle-class professional voters in Cardiff and elsewhere, both groups of whom will find the attempt to rewrite history insulting for the communities who suffered because of Thatcher's policies.

It is aimed at others who do not share the values that underpinned the Labor Party when it was founded - primarily seeking a fairer deal for ordinary workers.

Mr. Gething actually fits this new perverse form of laborism perfectly. He likes to pretend that he was helping a business in his constituency, but there is no denying that he put pressure (he doesn't like that word, but I can't think of a better word) on the NRW regulator, asking them to be lenient with the polluting enterprise of its donors. The look will not improve with age.

My fear is that by the next Senedd election in 2026, many Welsh voters disillusioned with the Conservatives and Labor will be tempted by the superficial appeal of populism and vote for Reform UK.

The possibility of this happening will increase if Richard Tice is replaced as leader of the Reform Party by the party's owner (which Democratic Party has an owner?), Nigel Farage.",exbulletin.com,news,ExBulletin,,0.2705882352941176,448929865,1,https://nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-cabinet.jpg,eng-9411762

The e-mail listed what it depicted as 16 posts from 2018 to present that it claimed violated Google policy. The full e-mail and the spreadsheet listing the posts Google objected to are at the end of this post as footnote 1.

We consulted several experts. All are confident that Google relied on algorithms to single out these posts. As we will explain, they also stressed that whatever Google is doing here, it is not for advertisers.

Given the gravity of Google's threat, it is shocking that the AI results are plainly and systematically flawed. The algos did not even accurately identify unique posts that had advertising on them, which is presumably the first screen in this process. Google actually fingered only 14 posts in its spreadsheet, and not 16 as shown, for a false positive rate merely on identifying posts accurately, of 12.5%.

Those 14 posts are out of 33,000 over the history of the site and approximately 20,000 over the time frame Google apparently used, 2018 to now. So we are faced with an ad embargo over posts that at best are less than 0.1% of our total content.

And of those 14, Google stated objections for only 8. Of those 8, nearly all, as we will explain, look nonsensical on their face.

For those new to Naked Capitalism, the publication is regularly included in lists of best economics and finance websites. Our content, including comments, is archived every month by the Library of Congress. Our major original reporting has been picked up by major publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, Bloomberg, and the New York Times. We have articles included by academic databases such as the Proquest news database. Our comments section has been taught as a case study of reader engagement in the Sulzberger Program at the Columbia School of Journalism, a year-long course for mid-career media professionals.

So it seems peculiar with this site having a reputation for high-caliber analysis and original reporting, and a ""best of the Web"" level comments section, for Google to single us out for potentially its most extreme punishment after not voicing any objection since we started running ads, more than 16 years ago.

We'll discuss:

Why these censorship demands are not advertiser-driven

The non-existent posts in the spreadsheet

The wildly inaccurate negative classifications

Censorship Demands Do Not Come From Advertisers

We have been running Google ads from the early days of this site, which launched in 2006. We have never gotten any complaints from readers or from our ad agency on behalf of advertisers about the posts Google took issue with, let alone other posts or our posts generally. That Google flagged these 14 posts is odd given how dated most are:

1 from 2018

2 from 2021

7 from 2022

3 from 2023

1 from 2024

It is a virtual certainty that no person reviewed this selection of posts before Google sent its complaint. It is also a virtual certainty that no Internet readers were looking at material this stale either. This is even more true given that 6 of the 14 were news summaries, as in our daily Links or our weekday Water Cooler, which are particularly ephemeral and mainly reflect outside content.

A recovering ad sales expert looked at our case and remarked:

No human is flagging these posts. This is all done entirely by AI. Google's Gemini is notoriously bad and biased. Not sure if Gemini has anything to do with it. But if it does, it would explain a lot.

Advertisers want to communicate with people to sell their products to. It's hard to imagine that they don't want to sell products to your readers. And I'm pretty sure advertisers have no idea that the Google bot is blocking their carefully crafted communications from reaching your readers -- which is what ""demonetize"" means.

Then too, advertisers are using the automated Google system to place ads, and they get to pick and choose some characteristics that publishers offer, and they can specify certain things. Google's AI takes it from there.

But the fundamental thing is that advertisers want to connect with humans and sell them stuff. Blocking their communications to humans is not helpful in making sales.

I'm very worried about Google. It has immense power over the publishing industry. It controls nearly all the infrastructure to place ads on websites. It is now getting sued by publishers from News Corp on down, and by the FTC. They have lots of very good reasons - and you put your finger on one of them.

We have managed to reach only one other publisher, whose beats overlap considerably with ours, who also got a nastygram from his ad service on behalf of Google with a list of offending posts. But Google did not threaten him with demonetization as it did with us.

This publisher identified posts where the claims were erroneous and Google relented on those. This indicates that Google has been sloppy and overreaching in this area for some time and has not bothered to correct their algorithm.

Our contact was finally able to get Google to articulate its remaining objections with granularity. They were all about comments, not the posts proper.

It is problematic for Google to be censoring reader comments, since the example above underscores the notion that Google's process is not advertiser-driven.

As articles about advertiser concerns attest, their big worry is an ad appearing in visual proximity to content at odds with the brand image or intended messaging.

Reader attention falls off rapidly within posts and articles, which is why writers and publishers pay special attention to lead paragraphs; that's also why advertising placements are overwhelmingly in prime real estate, towards the top of the page, or are popups, which nag the reader wherever they are. We do not allow any popup ads.

We do have one ad slot, which often does not ""fill"", that is towards the end of our posts and thus near the start of the comments section. Since our comments section is very active, only the top one to at most three (depending on their length) would be near an ad.

So for the considerable majority of our relatively sparse ads, the viewer will see any ads very early in a post, and will get their impression, and perhaps even click through, then. It will be minutes of reading later before they get to comments, which often are many and always varied, with readers regularly and vigorously contesting factually-challenged views.

Unlike most sites of our size, we make a large budget commitment to moderation. The result is that our comments section is widely recognized as one of the best on the Internet, as reflected it being the focus of a session in a Columbia School of Journalism course. We do not allow invective, unsupported outlier views (""Making Shit Up""), and regularly reject comments for lack of backup, particularly links to sources. In particular, we do not allow comments that are clearly wrong-headed, like those that oppose vaccination.

So given the substantial time and screen real estate space between our ads and the the majority of our comments, and our considerable investment in having the comments section be informative and accurate, it is hard to see Google legitimately depicting their censorship in our case as being out of their tender concern for advertisers.

Non-Existent Posts in the Spreadsheet

Why do we say Google's spreadsheet lists only 14 potentially naughty posts rather than 16?

Rows 4 and 12 are duplicate entries, so one must be thrown out. Row 7 is not a post:

Rows 4 and 12 both list the same URL: www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/10/mark-ames-shamiwitness-bellingcat-neocons-collaborated-influential-isis-propagandist-twitter.html

Row 7 lists a URL for a category page: www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/technology-and-innovation

The URLs in rows 4 and 12 are identical, yet the AI somehow did not catch that. The URL in row 7 is for a category page, automatically generated by WordPress, that simply lists post titles under that category. How can a table of contents violate any advertising agreement when it contains no ads? On top of that, none of the articles on this category page are among the 14 Google listed.

But the category is ""Technology and Innovation"" and contains articles about Google, particularly anti-trust actions and lawsuits. So could the AI be sanctioning us for featuring negative news stories about Google?

The Wildly Inaccurate Negative Classifications

Google did not cite any misconduct on some posts in its spreadsheet. On the 8 where Google did, virtually all are off the mark, some wildly so.

Let us start with the one that got the most red tags. It was an article by Tom Englehardt, a highly respected writer, editor, and publisher. His piece was a retrospective on the foreign policy expert Chalmers Johnson's bestseller, Blowback (which Englehardt had edited), titled Blowback for the Twenty-First Century, Remembering Chalmers Johnson.

Google's spreadsheet dinged Englehardt's article as follows: [ANTI_VACCINATION, HATEFUL_CONTENT, DEMONSTRABLY_FALSE_DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,HARMFUL_HEALTH_CLAIM].

Engelhardt was completely mystified and said he had gotten no complaints about this 2022 post. The article has nothing about vaccines or health. The only mentions in comments are in passing and harmless, such as:

....When I tell my Democrat friends that Biden's COVID policies have been arguably worse than Trump's, they are shocked that I would say such a thing.

The article includes many quotes from Chalmers' book, after which Engelhardt segues to a view that ought to appeal to Google's Trump-loathing executives and employees: that Trump is a form of blowback. So it is hard to see the extended but not-even-strident criticism of Trump as amounting to ""HATEFUL_CONTENT].

Perhaps the algo choked on this section?

He certainly marked another key moment in what Chalmers would have thought of as the domestic version of imperial decline. In fact, looking back or, given his insistence that the 2020 election was ""fake"" or ""rigged,"" looking toward a country in ever-greater crisis, it seems to me that we could redub him Blowback Donald.

The ""He"" at the start of the paragraph is obviously Trump but Engelhardt violated a writing convention by opening a paragraph with a pronoun rather than a proper name. The second sentence is long and awkward and doesn't identify Trump until the end. Did the AI read the reference to ""the 2020 election was ""'fake' or 'rigged,'"" as Engelhardt's claim, as opposed to Trump's?

The first comment linked to and excerpted: WHO Forced into Humiliating Backdown. Biden had proposed 13 ""controversial"" amendments to International Health Regulations. For the most part, advanced economy countries backed them. But, as Reuters confirmed 47 members of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa opposed them, along with Iran and Malaysia (the link in comments adds Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). So Google is opposed to readers reporting on the US making proposals to the WHO that go down to defeat?

Another example is a post that Rajiv Sethi, Professor of Economics at Barnard College, Columbia University, allowed us to cross post from his Substack: The Candidacy and Claims of RFK, Jr. Sethi is an extremely careful and rigorous writer. This is the thesis of his article:

Kennedy believes with a high degree of subjective certainty many things that are likely to be false, or at best remain unsupported by the very evidence he cites. I discuss one such case below, pertaining to all-cause mortality associated with the Pfizer vaccine. But the evidence is ambiguous enough to create doubts, and the failure of many mainstream outlets and experts to acknowledge these doubts fuels suspicion in the public at large, making people receptive to exaggerated claims in the opposite direction.

Sethi then proceeded to provide extensive data and analysis of his ""one such case"":

The claim in question is not that the vaccine is ineffective in preventing death from COVID-19, but that these reduced risks are outweighed by an increased risk of death from other factors. I believe that the claim is false (for reasons discussed below), but it is not outrageous.

Google labeled the post [AntiVaccination]. So according to Google, it is anti-vaccination (by implication for vaccines in general) to rigorously examine one not-totally-insane anti-Covid vaccine position, deem that the available evidence says the view is probably incorrect, and say more information is needed.

When we informed Sethi of the designation, he replied, ""Wow that's just incredible,"" and said he would write a post in protest.

Another nonsensical designation is Washington Faces Ultimate Snub, As Latin American Heads of State Threaten to Boycott Summit of Americas.

Google designated it [Demonstrably_False_Democratic_Process]. Huh?

The article reports on a revolt by Latin American leaders over a planned US ""Summit of the Americas"" where the US was proposing to exclude countries that it did not consider to be democratic, namely Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The leaders of Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia said they would not participate if the US did not include the three nations it did not deem to be democratic, and Brazil's president also planned to skip the confab.

The post is entirely accurate and links to statements by State Department officials and other solid sources, including quoting former Bolivia President Evo Morales criticizing US interventionism and sponsorship of coups. So it is somehow anti-democratic to report that countries the US deems to be democracies are not on board with excluding other countries not operating up to US standards from summits?

Another Google label that seems bizarre is having [sensitive event] as a mark of shame, here applied to a post by John Helmer, Ukraine Is Smashed - This Is How It Will Be Repaired.

If discussion of sensitive events were verboten, reporting and commentary would be restricted to the likes of feel-good stories, cat videos, recipes, and decorating tips. The public would be kept ignorant of everything important that was happening, and particularly events like mass shootings, natural disasters, coups, drug overdoses, and potential develoments that were simply upsetting, like market swan dives or partisan rows.

Helmer's post focused on what the map of Ukraine might look like after the war. His post included maps from the widely-cited neocon Institute of the Study of War and the New York Times.

So what could possibly be the ""sensitive event""? Many analysts, commentators, and officials have been discussing what might be left of Ukraine when Russia's Special Military Operation ends. Is it that Helmer contemplated, in 2022, that Russia would wind up occupying more territory than it held then? Or was it the use of the word ""smashed"" as a reference to the Japanese art of kintsugi, which he described as:

Starting several hundred years earlier, the Japanese, having to live in an earthquake zone, had the idea of restoring broken ceramic dishes, cups, and pots. Instead of trying to make the repairs seamless and invisible, they invented kintsugi (lead image) - this is the art of filling the fracture lines with lacquer, and making of the old thing an altogether new one.

This peculiar designation raises another set of concerns about Google's AI: How frequently is it updated? For instance, there has been a marked increase in press coverage of violence as a result of the Gaza conflict: bombings and snipings of fleeing Palestinians, children being operated on without anesthetic, doctors alleging they were tortured. If Google is not keeping its algos current, it could punish independent sites for being au courant with reporting when reporting takes a bloodier turn. That of course would also help secure the advantageous position of mainstream media.

Yet another peculiar Google choice: Links 1/6/2023 as [HARMFUL_HEALTH_CLAIMS,ANTI_VACCINATION,HATEFUL_CONTENT]

The section below is probably what triggered the red flags. The algo is apparently unable to recognize that criticism of the Covid vaccine mandate is not anti-vaccination. The extract below cites a study that shows that the vaccines were more effective, at least with the early variants, at preventing bad outcomes than having had a previous case of Covid.

The section presumed to be Google offending:

SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Hospitalization, and Death in Vaccinated and Infected Individuals by Age Groups in Indiana, 2021‒2022 American Journal of Public Health n = 267,847. From the Abstract: ""All-cause mortality in the vaccinated, however, was 37% lower than that of the previously infected. The rates of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations were 24% and 37% lower in the vaccinated than in the previously infected. The significantly lower rates of all-cause ED visits, hospitalizations, and mortality in the vaccinated highlight the real-world benefits of vaccination. The data raise questions about the wisdom of reliance on natural immunity when safe and effective vaccines are available."" Of course, the virus is evolving, under a (now global) policy of mass infection, so these figures may change. For the avoidance of doubt, I'm fully in agreement with KLG's views on the ethics of vaccine mandates (""no""). And population level-benefit, as here, is not the same as bad clinical outcomes in certain cases (again, why mandates are bad). As I keep saying, we mandated the wrong thing (vaccines) and didn't mandate the right thing (non-pharmaceutical interventions). So it goes.

Perhaps the algo do not know what non-pharmaceutical interventions are (e.g., masking, ventilation, social distancing, and hand washing) and that they are endorsed by the WHO and the CDC?

Or perhaps the algo does not recognize that criticizing the vaccine mandate policy is not the same as being opposed to vaccines

Unlike the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) series with which most Americans are familar, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were non-sterilizing, meaning they did not prevent disease spread (""breakthrough infections"") at the population level.

Yet the vaccine mandates were based on the false and explicitly stated premise that if you got the Covid jabs, you could go out in public with no mask and not present a hazard to others. This premise was expressed at the folk wisdom level by the widely propagated slogan""vax and relax,"" and at the official level by President Biden's statement that ""if you're vaccinated, you are protected."" That bogus notion was reinforced policies likeNew York City's Key to NYC program, where proof of vaccination wass required for indoor dining, indoor fitness, and indoor entertainment, and by then CDC Director Rochelle Walensky's statement that ""the scarlet letter of this pandemic is the mask."" Even Harvard, where Walensky had been a professor of medicine, objected strenuously to this remark, saying:

Masks are not a ""scarlet letter"" ...They're also just necessary to prevent transmission of the virus. There is no path out of this pandemic without masks.

As for HATEFUL_CONTENT, the only thing we could find was:

Victory to Come When Russian Empire 'Ceases to Exist': Ukraine Parliament Quotes Nazi Collaborator Haaretz. Bandera.

Haaretz called out the existence of Nazis in Ukraine. That again is not a secret. The now-ex Ukraine military chief General Zaluzhny was depicted in the Western press as having not one but two busts of the brutal Stepan Bandera in his office. Far too many photos of Ukraine soldiers also show Nazi insignia, such as the black sun and the wolfsangel.

The algo labeled Links 5/4/2023 as [AntiVaccination]. Apparently small websites are not allowed to quote studies from top tier medical journals and tease out their implications. This text is the most plausible candidate as to what set off the Google machinery:

Evaluation of Waning of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Induced Immunity JAMA. The Abstract: ""This systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary data from 40 studies found that the estimated vaccine effectiveness against both laboratory-confirmed Omicron infection and symptomatic disease was lower than 20% at 6 months from the administration of the primary vaccination cycle and less than 30% at 9 months from the administration of a booster dose. Compared with the Delta variant, a more prominent and quicker waning of protection was found. These findings suggest that ."" Remember ""You are protected?"" Good times. Liberal Democrats should pay a terrible price for its vax-only strategy. Sadly, there's no evidence they will pay any price at all, unless President Wakefield's candidacy catches fire.

Google dinged Links 1/31/2024 as [Hateful content]. We did not find anything problematic in the post. However, since early 2022, virtually every day, readers have been submitting sardonic and topic new lyrics to pop standards. The first comment, which would be near an ad if our final ad spot ""filled,"" was about the Israeli Defense Force sniping children. From the top:

UP ON THE GAZA WALL

(melody borrowed from You Make My Dreams Come True by Hall & Oates)

My best shot?

I got some Arab kid in sandals

Up here that ain't a scandal

It's just a sniper's game, yeah, yeah

We all talk

A lot our thoughts may seem like chatter

We get bored up here together

We shoot kids to ease our pain

Google's search engine shows not only many reports of IDF soldiers sniping children (and systematically targeting journalists), but also that the UN reported the same crime in 2019, per the Telegraph: Israeli snipers targeted children, health workers and journalists in Gaza protests, UN says. Advertisers did not boycott the Torygraph for reporting this story.

Our attorney, who is a media/First Amendment expert and has won 2 Supreme Court cases, did not see the ditty as unacceptable from an advertiser perspective. Anything that overlaps with opinion expressed in mainstream media or highly trafficked and reputable sites is by definition not problematic discourse. It is well within boundaries of mainstream commentary even if it does use dark humor to make its point. Imagine how many demerits Google would give Dr. Strangelove!

The last of the eight was the post Google listed twice, Mark Ames: ShamiWitness: When Bellingcat and Neocons Collaborated With The Most Influential ISIS Propagandist On Twitter, but only gave a red label once: [Violence or gore].

Here Google had an arguable point. The post included a photo of a jihadist holding up a beheaded head. Yes, the head was pixtelated but one could contend not sufficiently. The same image is on Twitter and a Reddit thread, so some sites do not see it as outside the pale. But author Mark Ames said the image was not essential to the argument and suggested we remove it, which we have done.

Needless to say, there are 6 additional posts where Google has not clued us into why they were demonetized. Given the rampant inaccuracies in the designations they did make, it seems a waste of mental energy to try to fathom what the issue might have been.

We have asked our ad service to ask Google to designate the particular section(s) of text that they deemed to be problematic, since they have provided that information to other publishers. We have not gotten a reply.

In the mean time, I hope you will circulate this post widely. It is a case study in poorly implemented AI and how it does damage. If Google, which has more money that God, can't get this right, who can? Technologists, business people being pressed to get on the AI bandwagon, Internet publishers and free speech advocates should all be alarmed when random mistakes can be rolled up into a bill of attainder with no appeal.

_____

We believe the text of the message from our ad service accurately represents what Google told them, since we raised extensive objections and our ad service went back to Google over them. We would have expected the ad service to have identified any errors in their transmittal and told us rather than escalating with Google.

Cause unknown.,"The city of Greenville's public utility apologized Saturday for a widespread outage whose cause remained a mystery hours after power was restored.

Most homes and businesses in the city, which has a population of about 90,800, lost electricity Saturday morning, police said in a series of alerts Saturday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Power was restored within about two hours, police said.

Greenville is roughly about 85 miles southeast of Raleigh and home to East Carolina University, a 1,600 acre public institution.

Police first reported the outage at 10 a.m.

""Major power outage in the N.C. 33/264 corridor of the city,"" police initially said on X.

""Officers are being directed to numerous intersections to direct traffic,"" the alert by police continued. ""A reminder, all unattended intersections without power should be treated as a four-way stop.""

Eight minutes later, police said the outage extended beyond the N.C. 33/264 corridor.

""Much of city impacted,"" police posted on X at 10:08 a.m. ""Please continue to treat all intersections as a four way stop.""

At 11:15 a.m., police said utility crews estimated restoration could take 30 minutes to several hours. ""Already restored in some areas,"" police said on X.

An hour later, Greenville Utilities said all residential customers had power back.

""Crews are now focused on industrial customers,"" the utility posted on X.

At 2:30 p.m. Saturday, crews continued to investigate the cause, the utility posted on X. ""And we have no update on the cause at this time,"" the utility posted. ""We apologize for any inconvenience our customers may have experienced due to this outage.""

Greenville Utilities is owned by the residents of the city but operates under a separate charter issued by the North Carolina General Assembly, according to the Greenville Utilities Commission website.

Canada's lengthy fire season heavily depends on patterns we see across the country during the winter and spring.

Widespread drought blanketed the country from British Columbia to Labrador as February drew to a close -- even worse than we saw ahead of the unprecedented blazes that raged in 2023, which consumed 18.5 million hectares of land across the country.

Conditions through the remainder of spring will dictate just how favourable the environment will be to support the spark and spread of wildfires heading into the warm season.

Visit The Weather Network's wildfire hub to keep up with the latest on the wildfire season across Canada.

When we're looking for clues about this year's upcoming wildfire season, it's helpful to compare this past winter to the winter of 2022-23 to pick out similarities and differences.

RELATED: What we can learn from Canada's record wildfire season as a new one approaches

Below-normal precipitation has been the norm across Western Canada for the past couple of years. Last winter saw less rain and snow than average across much of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Northern sections of these provinces were hardest-hit by the lack of winter precipitation.

As a result of those warmer and drier patterns, we entered the spring of 2023 with widespread drought across the western half of the country. Moderate to severe drought covered much of the West Coast and the western Prairies, even stretching deep into the heart of the Northwest Territories.

How does that compare to this past winter?

DON'T MISS: Warmest winter ever: Canada's record season reaches new heights

We just endured our warmest winter on record across Canada. Seasonal temperatures were far above average for nearly every square kilometre of the country, with the most unseasonable warmth targeting the northern and eastern Prairies, as well as northern sections of Ontario and Quebec.

That warmth had a significant impact on precipitation throughout the season.

Many communities across the country saw significantly below-seasonal precipitation totals this past winter. A significant factor was a relative lack of meaningful snows across much of the country.

Only a few spots managed to exceed their usual snowfall numbers through this point in the season, including Vancouver, Calgary, and Halifax. A healthy snowpack is important for keeping soils and vegetation saturated before spring's rains arrive.

Subpar precipitation and persistently warm temperatures have done a number on the ground across the country. We ended this winter with much worse and more widespread drought than we saw at the same time last year.

MUST SEE: Historic El Niño has weakened, but its impacts hang on

Drought conditions are entrenched from coast to coast, with nearly three-fourths of the country enduring abnormally dry conditions or full-blown drought.

The sheer nationwide extent and severity of the drought is concerning. Wide swaths of B.C., the Prairies, and northern Ontario have fallen into severe drought, with pockets of 'extreme' and 'exceptional' -- the two worst categories on the Canadian Drought Monitor's monthly analysis -- found throughout B.C., Alberta, and the Northwest Territories.

Patterns are changing with the seasons, and there's an opportunity for springtime rain and snow to help reverse some of the thirst the ground incurred this past winter.

The Weather Network's spring forecast holds tough news for the hardest-hit areas across Western Canada.

We're likely to see an active storm track deflected far to the north for much of the season, bringing below-seasonal precipitation to B.C. and Alberta as storms bypass the region.

A similar situation may play out for Ontario and Quebec as prevailing patterns suggest that storms with beneficial rains will largely miss the region to the west and to the east, leaving below-seasonal precipitation for a significant swath of the two provinces.

As such, it is the last opportunity for many to catch a glimpse of the impressive event before its long hiatus from North America.

Kansans will be unable to see the entirety of the eclipse on the day it occurs, according to NASA. This has prompted some living in the Sunflower State to make plans for road trips to states like Texas, Arkansas and others to get the full experience. Others are holding eclipse classes in the days leading up to the event to prepare people for what's coming.

Those unable to get out of state can still make the best of the opportunity to watch the eclipse by heading to a local watch party. Many are being announced for locations across the state at universities and astronomy centers which offer safe opportunities to watch the event.

obust investment activity and strengthening private consumption demand is driving growth in the Indian economy amidst the sluggish global growth, according to the Finance Ministry's monthly review released on Friday.

The strong demand is evident from indicators like burgeoning air passenger traffic and sale of passenger vehicles, rising digital payments, improved consumer confidence and expectations of a normal monsoon, the report states.

Increased demand for residential properties in tier-2 and tier-3 cities augers well for furthering construction activity. Non-farm employment has revived, improving the capacity to absorb the labour leaving agriculture. The ascent of manufacturing sector employment is expected to be marked by upscaling of enterprises and sunrise sectors emerging as catalysts for generating quality employment, the report points out.

India's inflation outlook for the upcoming months is positive. Core inflation is trending downwards, indicating a broad-based moderation in price pressures. The pick-up in summer sowing is likely to help reduce food prices, the report states.

On the external front, the narrowing merchandise trade deficit and the rising net services receipts are expected to result in an improvement in the current account balance in FY24.

In FY25, however, the current account deficit will bear watching. An increase in domestic household savings will be necessary to finance private sector capital formation in the economy, the report states.

Improving global investor confidence on India has started reflecting in foreign portfolio investment flows. The announcement by Bloomberg that India would be included in its bond index from January 2025 should bolster inflows, buoyed by the fiscal prudence that the government has demonstrated over the years. Bond investors will base their investment decisions based on their perception of its persistence. On the whole, India looks positively towards the dawn of FY25, it adds.

here has been a reduction in the share of coal import in the total coal consumption in the country. The share of coal import declined to 21% during April 2023 to January 2024, which was 22.48% during the corresponding period of previous year.

There has been a reduction of 36.69% in the volume of coal imported for blending by thermal power plants, amounting to 19.36 million tons (MT) during April 2023 to January 2024, in contrast to the same period of the previous year. This reduction in imported coal for blending signifies a shift towards utilizing domestic coal, thus reducing reliance on imports.

Conversely, there has been a notable increase of 94.21% in coal imports by imported coal-based power plants during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

As these power plants are designed based on imported coal only, the growth can be attributed to a substantial decline in import prices of coal during the aforementioned period. India primarily imports thermal coal from South Africa and Indonesia, and average prices from these countries decreased by approximately 54% and 38% respectively during April 2023 to January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the auction premium received by CIL, over the notified price of coal. It has decreased from 278% in the period from April 2022 to January 2023, to 82% during the same period in the fiscal year 2023-24. The reduction in auction premium is a testament to the ample availability of coal (currently 96 MT coal stock with coal companies) in the market.

The Native American Solar Eclipse Festival is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, April 6. A portion of Franklin Street will be closed for the festival and other events are scheduled for inside the Franklin Building and at the Paddock Arcade. The festival is presented by the Watertown Downtown Business Association.

It also falls during DBA's Eclipse Restaurant Week, April 1-8, created to showcase culinary excellence throughout the city. A festival tent with a stage and sound system will be set up at the foot of Franklin Street near Public Square, which will be open for traffic.

""We work very closely with the city,"" said Jill Van Hoesen, president of the DBA. ""We thought this was a great way to pull people in and give them some sort of a different type of history, other than to just come down and watch something. We're gearing it for education and for children. It's not only about the eclipse and democracy, but the Native American aspect as a whole, which really has a lot more to do with around here than sometimes people may think.""

The idea for the festival all goes back to another total eclipse seen in the north country -- in August 1142, and the work of a legendary ""peacemaker.""

The Native North American Traveling College, based in Akwesasne, which straddles the U.S.-Canada border, will be a key part of the festival. The college conserves cultural heritage through education, facilitation and commerce.

The roots of the NNATC can be traced to a van filled with resources educating people on what it means to be Indigenous. In 1974, it established a building of its own.

""We're celebrating our 50th year in existence,"" said executive director and museum manager Joyce Tekahnawiiaks King. The NNATC itself,at 1 Ronathahonni Lane, Akwesasne, on Cornwall Island, hosts events, cultural presentations, exhibits and tours.

King has lived her entire life in Akwesasne and has worked with all three Mohawk governments there: the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council and the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne.

When she worked for the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs, she also was responsible for managing the Akwesasne Notes Bookstore, the Akwesasne Tourist Information Center and the overall operations of the Mohawk Nation office.

She worked diligently as the director of the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force and holds a federal appointment as a justice of the peace under a section of the Canadian Indian Act. She has adjudicated in the Mohawk territories of Kahnawake and Akwesasne and is a popular keynote speaker on cultural issues and the environment.

In mid-March, she authored the essay, ""The Solar Eclipse and the Formation of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy,"" and sent a copy to the Times shortly after finishing it. It concludes:

""The solar eclipse is an occasion to be embraced by democracies around the world. The almost once-in-a-lifetime event needs to be celebrated and should serve to remind ourselves of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy which helped shaped the United States government we know today. Just ask Benjamin Franklin, or read his writings.""

On Sept. 16, 1987 (a day before Constitution Day and Citizenship Day), the U.S. Senate passed a resolution recognizing the influence of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy on the construction of the Constitution.

It noted, ""The original framers of the Constitution, including most notably, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, are known to have greatly admired the concepts, principles and governmental practices of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. Whereas the confederation of the original Thirteen Colonies into one republic was explicitly modeled upon the Iroquois Confederacy as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the Constitution itself.""

According to the Library of Congress, Franklin wrote to his printing partner, James Parker, ""It would be a very strange thing, if (the) Six Nations ... should be capable of forming a scheme for such a union, and be able to execute it in such a manner, as that it has subsisted ages, and appears indissoluble; and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English colonies, to whom it is more necessary, and must be more advantageous.""

King said that at the festival, the NNATC will have exhibits highlighting how the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was created. Its tribes were united through the work of the Peacemaker.

""We don't say his name,"" King said. ""You only do it when in ceremony.""

King's essay compiled oral Haudenosaunee history, which cites a solar eclipse in 1142 when the last of the five warring nations, the Seneca Nation, joined the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.

""Our oral history speaks of the solar eclipse, seen and acknowledged by the Onkwehonweh (original people) who were present during this auspicious occasion,"" King wrote. ""This occasion is supported by an article, 'Dating the Iroquois Confederacy' by Bruce E. Johansen, bearing in mind that the power and consequence of oral history is not to be underestimated.""

The Haudenosaunee, King explained, formed a confederacy long before the arrival of European colonizers. But before the confederacy, chaos reigned.

""The violence at that time was legendary: Retribution, revenge and retaliation were the three Rs of the era,"" she wrote in her essay. ""There was no way to escape this ruthlessness unless you lived on an island, which one family did and this is where the Peacemaker was born.""

King explained that beginning in the east, in the territory where the Peacemaker was to be born, lived the fiercest of the warring nations: the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) and that traversing west along the Great Lakes, existed the Oneida Nation, the Onondaga Nation, the Cayuga Nation and the Seneca Nation.

""As the Peacemaker grew, he envisioned putting an end to the warring nations,"" King wrote. ""Through his transcendence and visionary teachings, the Peacemaker established a system of governance. This system of governance became the confederacy of five nations which allowed each single nation to be autonomous and any decision affecting all five nations had to be approved by consensus. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is known to this day as the longest existing democracy in the world.""

King noted that ""oral history tells us that the Seneca Nation was the last nation to accept the Peacemaker's message of peace, strength and righteousness. The Seneca Nation was established, in present day maps, in western New York and eastern Pennsylvania. Haudenosaunee oratory recounts that the ratification of the uniting five nations was marked by a long solar eclipse. Through an examination of historic solar eclipses alongside the oral tradition pertaining to the longevity of the eclipse, this historical phenomenon took place at a site called Gonandaga in the year 1142.""

These days, the Ganondagan State Historic Site, also known as Boughton Hill, is a Native American historic site in Victor, Ontario County, 135 miles from Watertown. Spanning about 600 acres, Ganondagan is the original site of a 17th-century Seneca town that existed there for more than 350 years. The site includes the Seneca Art & Culture Center.

Victor is in the path of totality. Between noon and 5 p.m. on April 8, the historic site will host short presentations leading up to totality, including information on past eclipses in the context of Haudenosaunee history and the science behind total solar eclipses.

Traditional games may also be enjoyed before and after totality. The eclipse may be observed from either the main event field or from the top of Fort Hill. Programs after totality include Native American storytelling and a discussion of the shared experience of witnessing totality.

Festival events

Franklin Street, Van Hoesen said, will be closed from Goodale Street to the Square. In the Franklin Building, about a dozen displays will represent various Native American-related themes and vendors.

There will also be educational, family booths hosted by organizations such as the Sci-Tech Center of Northern New York, Thompson Park Zoo and Flower Memorial Library.

Meanwhile, several extra Native American Solar Eclipse Festival vendors will set up at the Paddock Arcade and join the regular Paddock Arcade Farm to Home Market, held each Saturday.

""We've had such a great response that our overflow vendors will be in the Paddock Arcade along with the normal Saturday vendors that are down there,"" Van Hoesen said. ""We'd love to see people over there also.""

Back at the Franklin Street area, a Pixelit mobile billboard will also be in the area showing an episode of the award-winning Marvel Studios-produced animated series, ""What If...?"" The sixth episode in season 2, ""What If... Kahhori Reshaped the World?"" premiered on Disney+ on Dec. 27. It introduces audiences to an original Super Hero, Kahhori, a young Mohawk woman on a quest to discover her power.

The episode, created in close collaboration with members of the Mohawk Nation, explores what would happen if the Tesseract (a cube designed to hold the powerful ""Space Stone"") fell to Earth and landed in the sovereign Haudenosaunee Confederacy before the colonization of America.

There will be performances put on by Along the Water 6 Nations Singers & Dancers throughout the day.

King said that as part of cultural education, the NNATC will have two exhibits. ""One will talk about the Peacemaker's journey and the significance of the solar eclipse.""

There will also be an activity at the NNATC for children, King said. ""And while I'm there at the exhibit, people can ask me anything and I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.""

The Jefferson County Historical Society, 228 Washington St., will be open for regular admissions and water will be available at its gift shop. Its current ""Presidential Signature"" exhibit is installed in the main gallery.

The Whimsical Pig, a graphic design/framing business located in the Franklin Building, will create T-shirts related to the April 6 festival and they will be on sale that day at the Franklin Building and at the Paddock Arcade.

restaurant week

The DBA created Eclipse Restaurant Week to showcase culinary excellence throughout the city. Restaurants, the DBA says, will offer special affordable menus -- from a two-course lunch option to a multi-course tasting experience.

""As a special bonus, all the restaurants around Public Square are going to be open that Saturday to bring people downtown who are staying in all these hotels getting ready for Monday and who are looking for something to do,"" Van Hoesen said. ""The restaurants are all busy preparing something unique and creative for Eclipse Restaurant Week, which means there will be different entrees, lunches and things like that, offering not only special meals, but special prices.""

The 16 establishments taking part: Paddock Club, Vito's Gourmet, O-Ho Boba Cafe, CaffeineHolic, Europe Cakes, Downtown Bistro 108, Cam's Pizzeria, Empire Square, City Wings, Bad Apple Downtown, The Crystal, Boots Brewing Company, Whistler's Tavern, Mr. Sub, Holy Smokes Bourbon and BBQ and Starch Cafe.

Empire of the sun

Vonnette T. Monteith, owner of Empire Square, 65 Public Square, has strategically put a plan in place for Solar Eclipse Restaurant Week, with specials during the first few days of the week.

""By Friday, we're going into a solar eclipse special,"" she said.

The restaurant will have two entrances designed for different appetites and schedules of festival attendees.

""The plan is that the main door is where all seated customers come into. All Restaurant Week customers will come into that door,"" Monteith said.

Two hostesses will be there to greet guests. ""I'm not letting anybody in the restaurant unless they are sitting and there are tables. We have limited occupancy and old bathrooms. You'll come into that one door, escorted to your table and be given a menu.""

For other customers, Empire Square's window doors will be open. ""I'll have tables there with grab-and-go special menus,"" Monteith said. That menu will be a sandwich, chips, water and cookies.

The restaurant will serve alcohol to seated customers only. ""I have a mixologist for a bartender (Sarah Daus) and she's coming up with the solar eclipse cocktail special,"" Monteith said. ""We will not be pushing alcoholic drinks out the window doors.""

Empire Square has a plan, but there's uncertainty about how many people will be downtown during eclipse week, especially on April 7 and 8.

""I think the best bet for us is to see what Thursday and Friday looks like,"" Monteith said. ""I have this plan, but I'm not going to make 10,000 sandwiches just yet. I would rather run out of food than be stuck with 10,000 sandwiches. I wouldn't even be able to give away 10,000 sandwiches, and I don't want to throw it away.""

On the evening of the festival, April 6, Empire Square will host the Jesse Collins Trio for musical entertainment. The trio performs classic jazz and Collins's original music.

Cause unknown.,"The city of Greenville's public utility apologized Saturday for a widespread outage whose cause remained a mystery hours after power was restored.

Most homes and businesses in the city, which has a population of about 90,800, lost electricity Saturday morning, police said in a series of alerts Saturday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Power was restored within about two hours, police said.

Greenville is roughly about 85 miles southeast of Raleigh and home to East Carolina University, a 1,600 acre public institution.

Police first reported the outage at 10 a.m.

""Major power outage in the N.C. 33/264 corridor of the city,"" police initially said on X.

""Officers are being directed to numerous intersections to direct traffic,"" the alert by police continued. ""A reminder, all unattended intersections without power should be treated as a four-way stop.""

Eight minutes later, police said the outage extended beyond the N.C. 33/264 corridor.

""Much of city impacted,"" police posted on X at 10:08 a.m. ""Please continue to treat all intersections as a four way stop.""

At 11:15 a.m., police said utility crews estimated restoration could take 30 minutes to several hours. ""Already restored in some areas,"" police said on X.

An hour later, Greenville Utilities said all residential customers had power back.

""Crews are now focused on industrial customers,"" the utility posted on X.

At 2:30 p.m. Saturday, crews continued to investigate the cause, the utility posted on X. ""And we have no update on the cause at this time,"" the utility posted. ""We apologize for any inconvenience our customers may have experienced due to this outage.""

Greenville Utilities is owned by the residents of the city but operates under a separate charter issued by the North Carolina General Assembly, according to the Greenville Utilities Commission website.

The utility provides electricity, water, sewer and natural gas to the city and 75% of Pitt County, with a combined total of nearly 168,000 customer connections.

China's hydro generation has been essentially flat for the last three years, despite commissioning several large new power plants, as a prolonged drought has sharply reduced river flows in the southwestern part of the country.

Since the drought started in the middle of 2022, China has been forced to turn back to coal to meet electricity consumption, while wind and solar have helped meet some of the growth in demand.

Installed hydro capacity had climbed 18% to 422 million kilowatts (kW) by the end of 2023 from 358 million kW at the end of 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

But the amount of hydro electricity generated fell 1% to 1,141 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023 from 1,153 billion kWh fours years earlier (""Output of energy products"", NBS, March 2024).

Based on the previous trend, drought cut generation by about 190 billion kWh (-14%) in 2023 compared with what it might have been under normal river conditions based on capacity additions.

SOUTHWEST CHINA

Most of the country's hydro generation comes from a string of massive cascade dams and power stations situated on the Yangtze and its tributaries, which drain the Tibetan plateau and other parts of the southwest.

The neighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan alone accounted for 48% of the country's total hydroelectric generation in 2020.

If the downstream province of Hubei, home to the giant Three Gorges Dam, is included, the generation share reaches 60%.

Other southwestern areas drained by the Yangtze and smaller rivers, including Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Chongqing, take the share to 75%.

Southwest China receives most of its annual precipitation between June and August during the East Asian Monsoon, with a smaller amount between March and May during the spring rains, while autumn and winter are very dry.

Since the middle of 2022, however, much of the region has been gripped by a drought that has sharply reduced river flows.

In most of Tibet and parts of Sichuan and Yunnan, rainfall has been 50% or more below average since the middle of 2022.

The city of Yibin, located on the border between Sichuan and Yunnan, received just 663 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 2023 and 1,024 millimetres in 2022 compared with an average of 1,225 millimetres per year between 2014 and 2021.",bdnews24.com,news,bdnews24.com,John Kemp,-0.1137254901960785,448929024,1,https://gumlet.assettype.com/bdnews24-english%2F2023-12%2F259c4f49-b0a0-49a2-8ccf-46d20bd85ed8%2Fchinese_national_flag_061223_01.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&overlay=https%3A%2F%2Fgumlet.assettype.com%2Fbdnews24-english%2F2024-03%2F28291984-e0a6-45ce-80c7-7a8381ba2efa%2Fbdnews24_1200_temp_12032024.jpg&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width_pct=1,

Technology, with its continuous advancement, plays a pivotal role in enhancing supply chain operations, offering unprecedented levels of transparency, agility, and customer satisfaction. From harnessing data analytics for better demand forecasting to leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time tracking, technology's role in supply chain enhancement cannot be understated. This article aims to explore the various technological innovations that have revolutionized supply chain management and how businesses can leverage these advancements to stay competitive in a global market.

The integration of data analytics into supply chain management allows businesses to accurately predict future demand. By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and consumer behavior patterns, companies can adjust their inventory levels, optimize product distribution strategies, and reduce holding costs. This foresighted approach not only minimizes wastage and excess inventory but also ensures that customer demands are met efficiently, bolstering overall satisfaction.

Advanced analytics tools enable firms to identify potential disruptions in the supply chain before they occur. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can take preemptive measures to mitigate risks associated with supply chain volatility, such as supplier failures or transportation delays. This proactive stance significantly enhances supply chain resilience and reliability. The ease of document digitization and data sharing further streamlines supply chain operations, facilitating seamless collaboration between stakeholders. It not only speeds up the decision-making process but also promotes transparency, allowing businesses to build and maintain trust with their partners.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed supply chain management by enabling real-time tracking of goods and assets. With IoT devices, companies can monitor the location, condition, and movement of products throughout the supply chain. This level of visibility ensures timely delivery, reduces the risk of theft or loss, and enables companies to respond swiftly to any logistical challenges.

In addition to improving operational efficiency, the IoT also fosters enhanced communication between all stakeholders in the supply chain. By providing real-time data, everyone from suppliers to customers can have access to updated information regarding the status of goods. This transparency helps in building trust and fostering stronger relationships between businesses and their partners.

Blockchain technology offers a secure and transparent platform for conducting transactions across the supply chain. By creating an immutable ledger of transactions, blockchain ensures the authenticity of products and reduces the risk of fraud. This is particularly beneficial in industries where counterfeiting and tampering are prevalent concerns.

Blockchain's ability to provide a secure and unalterable record of transactions also facilitates smoother and more efficient customs processes. By eliminating the need for paper-based documentation, blockchain can significantly reduce delays and costs associated with cross-border trade, making global supply chains more accessible and reliable.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are redefining supply chain operations through intelligent automation and decision-making. AI-powered tools can automate routine tasks, such as inventory management and order processing, freeing up human resources to focus on more strategic initiatives. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can improve over time, continuously optimizing supply chain processes based on new data and insights.

Machine learning also plays a crucial role in identifying patterns and anomalies within large datasets, enabling companies to anticipate and address potential supply chain disruptions. By utilizing AI and ML, organizations can achieve a higher level of operational efficiency and adaptability, staying ahead in a rapidly changing market.

Sustainability has become a central focus in supply chain management, driven by increasing consumer demand for environmentally responsible practices. Technologies like IoT and AI can help businesses monitor and reduce their carbon footprint by optimizing routes, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing waste. This not only aligns with global sustainability goals but also positions companies as socially responsible, enhancing their brand image and customer loyalty.

Innovations such as circular supply chains, where resources are reused and recycled, also contribute to environmental sustainability. By leveraging technology to facilitate a circular economy, businesses can reduce their environmental impact while creating a more resilient and future-proof supply chain.

Technology is continuously transforming the supply chain landscape, offering immense potential for businesses to improve their operations and stay competitive. As new advancements emerge, it is crucial for companies to embrace a proactive approach towards integrating technology into their supply chain strategies. By staying abreast of technological innovations and leveraging them effectively, businesses can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, foster transparency and sustainability, and ultimately achieve success in the global market. Keeping up with technological advancements and leveraging them effectively can lead to sustainable growth and success for businesses in the supply chain industry.",bbntimes.com,news,bbntimes.com,Daniel Hall,0.2627450980392156,448928897,1,https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/What_You_Need_to_Know_About_Technologys_Role_in_Supply_Chain_Enhancement.jpg,

Canada's lengthy fire season heavily depends on patterns we see across the country during the winter and spring.

Widespread drought blanketed the country from British Columbia to Labrador as February drew to a close -- even worse than we saw ahead of the unprecedented blazes that raged in 2023, which consumed 18.5 million hectares of land across the country.

Conditions through the remainder of spring will dictate just how favourable the environment will be to support the spark and spread of wildfires heading into the warm season.

Visit The Weather Network's wildfire hub to keep up with the latest on the wildfire season across Canada.

When we're looking for clues about this year's upcoming wildfire season, it's helpful to compare this past winter to the winter of 2022-23 to pick out similarities and differences.

RELATED: What we can learn from Canada's record wildfire season as a new one approaches

Below-normal precipitation has been the norm across Western Canada for the past couple of years. Last winter saw less rain and snow than average across much of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Northern sections of these provinces were hardest-hit by the lack of winter precipitation.

As a result of those warmer and drier patterns, we entered the spring of 2023 with widespread drought across the western half of the country. Moderate to severe drought covered much of the West Coast and the western Prairies, even stretching deep into the heart of the Northwest Territories.

How does that compare to this past winter?

DON'T MISS: Warmest winter ever: Canada's record season reaches new heights

We just endured our warmest winter on record across Canada. Seasonal temperatures were far above average for nearly every square kilometre of the country, with the most unseasonable warmth targeting the northern and eastern Prairies, as well as northern sections of Ontario and Quebec.

That warmth had a significant impact on precipitation throughout the season.

Many communities across the country saw significantly below-seasonal precipitation totals this past winter. A significant factor was a relative lack of meaningful snows across much of the country.

Only a few spots managed to exceed their usual snowfall numbers through this point in the season, including Vancouver, Calgary, and Halifax. A healthy snowpack is important for keeping soils and vegetation saturated before spring's rains arrive.

Subpar precipitation and persistently warm temperatures have done a number on the ground across the country. We ended this winter with much worse and more widespread drought than we saw at the same time last year.

MUST SEE: Historic El Niño has weakened, but its impacts hang on

Drought conditions are entrenched from coast to coast, with nearly three-fourths of the country enduring abnormally dry conditions or full-blown drought.

The sheer nationwide extent and severity of the drought is concerning. Wide swaths of B.C., the Prairies, and northern Ontario have fallen into severe drought, with pockets of 'extreme' and 'exceptional' -- the two worst categories on the Canadian Drought Monitor's monthly analysis -- found throughout B.C., Alberta, and the Northwest Territories.

Patterns are changing with the seasons, and there's an opportunity for springtime rain and snow to help reverse some of the thirst the ground incurred this past winter.

The Weather Network's spring forecast holds tough news for the hardest-hit areas across Western Canada.

We're likely to see an active storm track deflected far to the north for much of the season, bringing below-seasonal precipitation to B.C. and Alberta as storms bypass the region.

A similar situation may play out for Ontario and Quebec as prevailing patterns suggest that storms with beneficial rains will largely miss the region to the west and to the east, leaving below-seasonal precipitation for a significant swath of the two provinces.

While four hours of testing were scheduled throughout the day, drivers were only able to take advantage of approximately three hours on account of a couple unexpected situations that delayed running.

The first stoppage came just 15 minutes after the green flag waved, and was caused by pieces of the track breaking apart on the exit of Turn 5.

Many drivers had been running wide over the exit curbs, and part of the asphalt just outside of the track line began to break apart and fly into the air from the forces the open wheel cars put through the track.

A red flag was thrown immediately, and the track safety crew spent the next 50 minutes filling the hole with a fast-setting epoxy, which seemed to hold up well for the rest of the day.

An extra 15 minutes were allotted to help make up for the lost time, but the day's busy schedule did not allow more added time than that.

Later in the afternoon, the final test session was delayed by five minutes due to an exceptional gust of wind that blew across the course.

Sand and dust were thick enough for a few minutes that visibility dropped to dangerous levels, but the gusts settled just enough a short time later to allow the remainder of the test session to continue.

The wind continued to affect drivers significantly, however, and many drivers ran long into the runoff areas as they pushed the limits in the afternoon.

Overall, 2,335 laps were completed across approximately eight hours of running on Friday and Saturday, giving each team plenty of data to sort through as they make plans for the rest of the season.

Christian Lundgaard set the fastest time of the weekend on Saturday, completing a lap of the 3.067-mile course in 1 minute 38.2199 seconds during the late afternoon session.

Will Power and Scott McLaughlin were second and third fastest respectively, each also setting times in the latter half of the second day.

Drivers were allowed to use their Push to Pass systems during the afternoon session, which simulated what they will have available for the qualifying runs later in the evening.

With 40 seconds of the boost available per lap, everyone could essentially use the extra power down each and every straight on the winding course.

That extra power combined with a track that was taking on more Firestone rubber and cooler track conditions helped to allow the times to continue to fall as the day progressed.

The fastest times of the weekend may still be to come, however, as qualifying is scheduled to take place when the sun is quite low in the sky.

By midafternoon, 3.09 inches of rain had been measured officially at Philadelphia International Airport, the highest total for a March day in 150 years of recordkeeping. It also was a daily record, the National Weather Service reported, by plenty.

Although the rains shut off earlier than had been predicted, the totals -- generally 2 to 3.5 inches -- came close to the forecast amounts, and several flood warnings and advisories remained in effect, along with a wind advisory in effect until 8 a.m. Sunday for gusts to 50 mph.

Cold winds will be an unwelcome challenge for the estimated 12,000 people expected to participate in the half marathon/7K Philadelphia Love Run, which gets underway at 7:30 a.m. And it won't be pleasant for the spectators. Lingering gusts up to 30 mph are expected, with wind chills in the upper teens and low 20s.

However, the winds are ""going to be a saving grace for areas north and west,"" said Bill Deger, senior meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. Temperatures out that way are forecast to drop below freezing early Sunday, but the winds are likely to dry out the streets before they can ice over, he said.

Also, he said, the region likely was catching a break with the fact that the trees haven't yet leafed out, which would have made them more susceptible to wind damage and, thus, power outages.

""It tends to be more of an issue when there is more weight on the trees,"" he said.

Downpours resulted in several road closings, but weren't especially disruptive. The airport reported that 18 departing or arriving flights out of 700 had been canceled, said spokesperson Heather Redfern, or about 2.5%. SEPTA detoured some buses during the heaviest rains, said spokesperson Andrew Busch, but didn't suspend any services.

The weather service said no major flooding had occurred or was expected.

Warnings for potential minor flooding included one for the Schuylkill at Norristown, which was forecast to crest just above flood stage early Sunday, and for the Rancocas Creek, in Burlington County. The Wissahickon and Pennypack Creeks in Philly sloshed over their banks, as did the Chester Creek, in Delaware County, and the Brandywine Creek, in Chester County.

The rain totals in Philly topped the old daily record for March rainfall, 2.79 inches, set back in 1912. It also was way over the old record for a March 23, 1.36 inches, set in 2015.

Deger said the storm, which tracked right along the coast, mined moisture from two familiar sources.

""It tapped into moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and as it moved up the coast it took a little more from the Atlantic,"" he said. Sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic have been running well above normal, increasing the available moisture supply.

At least the Love Run participants will have a sunny and dry race, but Deger says it's likely to be tougher on the spectators than the runners. The winds will die down later on, and temperatures will top out at 50, a few degrees below normal.

It's just fuel for Tigers in NCAA Tournament,"Despite Clemson basketball being the higher seed, many pundits predicted the Tigers to fall to No. 11 New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday.

No. 6 seed Clemsons (22-11) proved critics wrong and will have to show them again in the round of 32 when they face No. 3 seed Baylor (24-10) on Sunday (6:10 p.m., TNT). The Tigers are an underdog once more.

During a news conference Saturday at FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee, site of Clemson's NCAA tournament game, coach Brad Brownell said he and his team have seen and heard the doubters.

""We certainly recognize it,"" Brownell said. ""I mean, I don't know that we have this big boulder on our shoulder that we're using it as a rallying cry. ... I certainly mentioned it to our players, (and) our players were well aware.""

Brownell said his team has leaned into playing good basketball to silence the critics. It showed Friday as the Tigers are coming off their second-largest March Madness win in program history, 77-56 over the Lobos, who were a 2.5 favorite, according to betmgm.com.

""Once you get in March, you kind of have to wipe the slate, no matter who you're playing,"" guard Joseph Girard III said. ""So, after the New Mexico game, where not a lot of people picked us to win, we were on edge (and) had a lot of competitive spirit and fire.

In other words, feminists and woke activists argue that the male power fantasy is a social construct that makes men aggressive, and masculine aggression is supposedly the cause of most of society's ills.

I would point out, however, that we don't really see men talking about or obsessing much over power these days. Instead, it's women (mostly feminists) blithering incessantly about power, institutional power, imbalances in power and how much they want power. If I was to guess by their rantings at the root principle that inspires all of feminism it wouldn't be ""equality"", it would be the thirst for power.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

It's also important to understand that the female power fantasy looks distinctly and darkly different from the average male power fantasy and this is why so many people remain skeptical of women in authority. All we have to do is look at how they express their desires in fiction.

If one studies the archetypal ideals of the hero's journey (a hallmark of the male power fantasy), what we almost always find are stories of self sacrifice. Power for most men is meant to be used in service to others; to protect and to provide for those who cannot protect themselves. This symbolism is found everywhere in literature, television and movies centered on powerful and popular male figures. Rather than being ""toxic,"" men are compelled by their inherent relationship to power to achieve something greater for all the people around them.

This is not to say that there are no men with twisted motives. History is splattered with male rulers who have abused their authority and committed a host of atrocities. These men, however, are the exception to the rule. The majority of men desire a chance at heroism and adherence to a moral code. We used to call it ""chivalry"", the opposite of villainy.

The hero's journey usually requires a struggle to attain the power that will eventually be used by the man in question. It is at least subconsciously understood that power attained without experience and wisdom leads to corruption. In other words, for men, great power comes with great responsibility.

The female power fantasy, unfortunately, is very different. For feminists in particular, great power means never having to take responsibility for anything ever.

When fictional women with power are written by women (specifically feminists) or woke activists, you will see a considerable juxtaposition when it comes to how that power is attained and used. A female power fantasy does not inspire a woman to be a hero. In fact, when feminists write protagonists they often act like villains - They tend to be selfish, narcissistic, they lack depth and lack the redeeming qualities associated with principled people. When women fantasize about power they are more likely to reflect psychopathic traits instead of nurturing feminine traits.

There is no such thing as an archetypal hero's journey for modern women. In pop culture, female icons usually gain power automatically without any effort to earn it. They are born with magical abilities, magical or god-given talents, or they ""manifest"" power by sheer psychological will (the fantasy of witchcraft). They imagine what they want, and what they want is supposed to come to them magnetically. This is not just fiction to feminists; they really think this kind of magic is real.

Even in male power fantasies where a protagonist is born with certain strengths there is an immediate dilemma: How can I use this power for good and prevent it from corrupting me? This does not exist in feminist fiction. For them, power is a virtue in itself, and abusing power is always justified if it's a woman doing it. If they resort to evil, it's usually because of the trespasses of men. There's always an excuse.

In the past, stories of female power usually involved women using sexuality to influence men to do their bidding (sexuality being treated like magic). But this dynamic has long perturbed feminists who enjoy the idea of sexual manipulation but don't like the idea of women relying on men in order to project their ""agency."" So, in modern times feminists have shifted female power more into a male realm, with women acting like men, using physical force like men and asserting dominance in the way they imagine men assert dominance.

They've abandoned the idea of merely getting close to a man's power so they can exploit it. Instead, they now covet the institutional power within corporations and governments, believing they can cut out the ""middleman"" (no pun intended). This has given rise to the pervasive ""girl-boss"" meme in mainstream media, a bizarre construct which relies on making men look incompetent in order to make women in leadership look intelligent.

But here's where things go awry. Women are not men and will never be capable of what men are capable of. That is to say, men can survive and thrive without women but women will never be able to survive without men. It's a cold hard reality that feminists simply do not grasp; all feminist power relies on the charity and tolerance of men.

Woke activists like to claim with a certain tinge of glee that ""the world is progressing"" and say conservative men are angry because ""the patriarchy is losing power."" I find this argument fascinating because it's self-contradictory: If the patriarchy exists and men really are a monolithic power structure, then frankly there's nothing stopping us from crushing feminists under our boots like bugs and taking all that power back.",sgtreport.com,news,SGT Report,,0.1137254901960785,448928004,1,,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The Cebu Electricity Rights Advocates (Cera), a Cebu-based network of electricity consumer rights advocates, issued the warning during the launch of the Cebu Electricity Consumer Rights Campaign on Saturday, March 23, 2024, at the Palm Grass Hotel in downtown Cebu City.

Cera, which was established during the first week of March, advocates for consumers to have equal access to stable, reliable and cost-effective electricity. It also ensures the interests and demands of consumers are heard.

""We aim to provide the venues for the consumers' participation in determining the quality and cost of electricity provided to us. We hold Veco, Cebeco and Meco accountable in ensuring power is delivered to businesses and households in a reliable and cost-effective manner,"" said Cera.

To achieve stable power, Nathaniel Chua, Cera convenor, proposed merging current distributors to become one electricity distributor so they can pool their resources to provide a lower electricity rate to consumers.

""Instead of competition, why not collaboration? If we buy power in wholesale, we can negotiate for a lower price,"" he said.

The group encouraged people from different sectors to participate, saying everyone is affected when it comes to the issue of reliable and cost-effective sources of power.

Chua said there are no groups that focus on electricity and advocate for stable, reliable and affordable energy.

He said there should be a focus on three problems, which Cera deemed as the Energy Trilemma: energy security, which is the ability to meet current and future energy demand; energy equity, which is the ability to provide universal access to reliable, affordable and abundant energy for domestic and commercial use; and measures, which is the ability to mitigate and avoid environmental degradation and climate change impacts.

He belied claims that Cebu has an adequate supply of electricity, pointing to the unscheduled power interruption on Friday, March 22, and Saturday, in the franchise area of the Mactan Electric Company (Meco).

""As of now, ang supply nato sa electricity sa Cebu nipis ang atong reserve, so kinahanglan ta og stable power,"" said Chua.

(As of now, we need a stable source of power in Cebu since our electricity reserves are thin.)

Chua said the inadequate supply of electricity will also lead to economic consequences similar to what happened in Panay Island where unreliable electricity services caused a blackout from Jan. 2 to 5, leading to economic losses estimated at P3.6 billion.

He said they understood the need to balance cost and reliability, considering Cebu is an economic hub.

""We wish for these electric cooperatives and distribution utilities to provide the best available technology which is reliable and not prone to unscheduled power interruptions to be the choice of generating facilities to serve our interests,"" the group said.

In May last year, local business leaders expressed concerns over potential shortages in the Visayas grid following ""yellow alerts"" that were issued due to the high demand for electricity vis-à-vis lower reserves amid the hot dry season.

Cebu is currently under a dry spell as a result of El Niño, which the weather bureau Pagasa warned could persist until the end of May.

High usage of appliances such as air-conditioners, electric fans, refrigerators and other cooling devices has been noted to deal with the high heat index, which can reduce energy supply.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

It quickly became one of the most viewed miniseries to date, second only to ""Roots.""

I'm a historian of Japan who specializes in the history of the Tokugawa, or early modern era - a period from 1603 to 1868, during which the bulk of the action in ""Shogun"" takes place. As a first-year graduate student, I sat glued to the television for five nights in September 1980, enthralled that someone cared enough to create a series about the period in Japan's past that had captured my imagination.

I wasn't alone. In 1982, historian Henry D Smith estimated that one-fifth to one-half of students enrolled in university courses about Japan at that time had read the novel and became interested in Japan because of it.

""'Shōgun,'"" he added, ""probably conveyed more information about the daily life of Japan to more people than all the combined writings of scholars, journalists, and novelists since the Pacific War.""

Some even credit the series for making sushi trendy in the U.S.

That 1980 miniseries has now been remade as FX's ""Shogun,"" a 10-episode production that is garnering rave reviews - including a near-100% rating from review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.

Both miniseries closely hew to Clavell's 1975 novel, which is a fictionalized retelling of the story of the first Englishman, Will Adams - the character John Blackthorne in the novel - to set foot in Japan.

And yet there are subtle differences in each series that reveal the zeitgeist of each era, along with America's shifting attitudes toward Japan.

The 'Japanese miracle'

The original 1980 series reflects both the confidence of postwar America and its fascination with its resurgent former enemy.

World War II had left Japan devastated economically and psychologically. But by the 1970s and 1980s, the country had come to dominate global markets for consumer electronic, semiconductors and the auto industry. Its gross national product per capita rose spectacularly: from less than $200 in 1952 to $8,900 in 1980 - the year ""Shogun"" appeared on television - to almost $20,000 in 1988, surpassing the United States, West Germany and France.

Many Americans wanted to know the secret to Japan's head-spinning economic success - the so-called ""Japanese miracle."" Could Japan's history and culture offer clues?

During the 1970s and 1980s, scholars sought to understand the miracle by analyzing not just the Japanese economy but also the country's various institutions: schools, social policy, corporate culture and policing.

In his 1979 book, ""Japan as Number One: Lessons for America,"" sociologist Ezra Vogel argued that the U.S. could learn a lot from Japan, whether it was through the country's long-term economic planning, collaboration between government and industry, investments in education, and quality control of goods and services.

A window into Japan

Clavell's expansive 1,100-page novel was released in the middle of the Japanese miracle. It sold more than 7 million copies in five years; then the series aired, which prompted the sale of another 2.5 million copies.

In it, Clavell tells the story of Blackthorne, who, shipwrecked off the coast of Japan in 1600, finds the country in a peaceful interlude after an era of civil war. But that peace is about to be shattered by competition among the five regents who have been appointed to ensure the succession of a young heir to their former lord's position as top military leader.

In the meantime, local leaders don't know whether to treat Blackthorne and his crew as dangerous pirates or harmless traders. His men end up being imprisoned, but Blackthorne's knowledge of the world outside of Japan - not to mention his boatload of cannons, muskets and ammunition - save him.

He ends up offering advice and munitions to one of the regents, Lord Yoshi Toranaga, the fictional version of the real-life Tokugawa Ieyasu. With this edge, Toranaga rises to become shogun, the country's top military leader.

Viewers of the 1980 television series witness Blackthorne slowly learning Japanese and coming to appreciate the value of Japanese culture. For example, at first, he's resistant to bathing. Since cleanliness is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, his Japanese hosts find his refusal irrational.

Blackthorne's, and the viewers', gradual acclimatization to Japanese culture is complete when, late in the series, he is reunited with the crew of his Dutch ship who have been held in captivity. Blackthorne is thoroughly repulsed by their filth and demands a bath to cleanse himself from their contagion.

Blackthorne comes to see Japan as far more civilized than the West. Just like his real-life counterpart, Will Adams, he decides to remain in Japan even after being granted his freedom. He marries a Japanese woman, with whom he has two children, and ends his days on foreign soil.

From fascination to fear

However, the positive views of Japan that its economic miracle generated, and that ""Shogun"" reinforced, eroded as the U.S. trade deficit with Japan ballooned: from $10 billion in 1981 to $50 billion in 1985.

""Japan bashing"" spread in the U.S., and visceral anger exploded when American autoworkers smashed Toyota cars in March 1983 and congressmen shattered a Toshiba boombox with sledgehammers on the Capitol lawn in 1987. That same year, the magazine Foreign Affairs warned of ""The Coming U.S.-Japan Crisis.""

This backlash against Japan in the U.S. was also fueled by almost a decade of acquisitions of iconic American companies, such as Firestone, Columbia Pictures and Universal Studios, along with high-profile real estate, such as the iconic Rockefeller Center.

But the notion of Japan as a threat reached a peak in 1989, after which its economy stalled. The 1990s and early 2000s were dubbed Japan's ""lost decade.""

Yet a curiosity and love for Japanese culture persists, thanks, in part, to manga and anime. More Japanese feature films and television series are also making their way to popular streaming services, including the series ""Tokyo Girl,"" ""Midnight Diner"" and ""Sanctuary."" In December 2023, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Japan was ""on the precipice of a content boom.""

Widening the lens

As FX's remake of ""Shogun"" demonstrates, American viewers today apparently don't need to be slowly introduced to Japanese culture by a European guide.

In the new series, Blackthorne is not even the sole protagonist.

Instead, he shares the spotlight with several Japanese characters, such as Lord Yoshi Toranaga, who no longer serves as a one-dimensional sidekick to Blackthorne, as he did in the original miniseries.

This change is facilitated by the fact that Japanese characters now communicate directly with the audience in Japanese, with English subtitles. In the 1980 miniseries, the Japanese dialogue went untranslated. There were English-speaking Japanese characters in the original, such as Blackthorne's female translator, Mariko. But they spoke in a highly formalized, unrealistic English.

Along with depicting authentic costumes, combat and gestures, the show's Japanese characters speak using the native language of the early modern era instead of using the contemporary Japanese that made the 1980 series so unpopular among Japanese viewers. (Imagine a film on the American Revolution featuring George Washington speaking like Jimmy Kimmel.)

Of course, authenticity has its limits. The producers of both television series decided to adhere closely to the original novel. In doing so, they're perhaps unwittingly reproducing certain stereotypes about Japan.

Most strikingly, there's the fetishization of death, as several characters have a penchant for violence and sadism, while many others commit ritual suicide, or seppuku.

Part of this may have been simply a function of author Clavell being a self-professed ""storyteller, not an historian."" But this may have also reflected his experiences in World War II, when he spent three years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Still, as Clavell noted, he came to deeply admire the Japanese.

His novel, as a whole, beautifully conveys this admiration. The two miniseries have, in my view, successfully followed suit, enthralling audiences in each of their times.

The celestial event, set to cast a path of totality across 13 states, is anticipated to impact air travel operations before, during, and after the eclipse, according to the aviation agency.

The FAA indicated that the eclipse's effects on U.S. airspace are anticipated between approximately 2:30 p.m. and 3:40 p.m. ET. At this time, some 32 million people in North America are expected to witness the rare event, which is anticipated to be the most-watched solar eclipse in history.

A total solar eclipse occurs when the new moon passes directly in front of the sun, completely blocking out sunlight and casting the moon's shadow on the surface of Earth. The most recent total solar eclipse to happen on American soil was the Great American Eclipse in 2017.

A notice issued by the FAA to airmen emphasized potential impacts on air traffic and airports along the eclipse path from April 7 to April 10. Pilots and aviation personnel are advised to stay informed and prepared for possible disruptions.

In a statement, the FAA suggested that aircraft should ready themselves for potential airborne holding, reroutes, and departure clearance times that might be issued for all domestic IFR arrivals and departures during the eclipse.

Departing aircraft from airports along the eclipse path are ""strongly encouraged"" to coordinate their departure times as early as possible to assist fixed base operators with staging aircraft and alleviating ramp congestion.

""There may be a higher traffic volume than normal anticipated at airports along the path of the eclipse. Traffic should anticipate delays during peak traffic periods,"" the FAA stated.

The agency cautioned that parking may be limited, particularly at small, uncontrolled airports.

And with it, the potential for billions to perish at the touch of a trigger. Such scenarios are nothing new, but for a new generation raised amid ongoing nuclear disarmament efforts, the reality of nuclear war is as misunderstood as it is catastrophic. Author Annie Jacobsen, a Pulitzer Prize-finalist, reveals the stark truths about the power and potential of a nuclear attack in her new book ""Nuclear War: A Scenario,"" released this week by Dutton. Armed specifically declassified documents and deep and unprecedented access to major military players -- from former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to nuclear-weapons designer Richard L. Garwin -- Jacobsen describes a fictional nuclear attack on the Pentagon. with rich and alarming precision. The resulting writing is both terrifying and thrilling -- a lens into a future every politician should endeavor to prevent.

Hell on Earth. Washington, DC, Possibly Sometime in the Near Future

A 1-megaton thermonuclear weapon detonation begins with a flash of light and heat so tremendous it is impossible for the human mind to comprehend. One hundred and eighty million degrees Fahrenheit is four or five times hotter than the temperature at the center of the sun.

In the first fraction of a millisecond after the bomb strikes the Pentagon, there is light. Soft X-ray light with a very short wavelength. The light superheats the surrounding air to millions of degrees, creating a massive fire-ball that expands at millions of miles per hour. Within seconds, this fireball increases to a diameter of a little more than a mile, its light and heat so intense that concrete surfaces explode, metal objects melt or evaporate, stone shatters, humans instantaneously convert into combusting carbon. The five-story, five-sided structure and everything inside its 6.5 million square feet of office space explodes into superheated dust; all 27,000 Pentagon employees perishing instantly.

Not a single thing in the fireball remains. Nothing. Ground zero is zeroed.

Traveling at the speed of light, the radiating heat from the fireball ignites everything flammable several miles out in every direction. Curtains, paper, books, wood fences, people's clothing, dry leaves explode into flames and become kindling for a great firestorm that begins to consume a 100-or-more-square-mile area that was home to some 6 million people.

Northwest of the Pentagon, all 639 acres of Arlington National Cemetery -- including the visitors paying respects on this early spring afternoon, the groundskeepers mowing the lawn and the white-gloved members of the Old Guard keeping watch over the Tomb of the Unknowns -- are instantly transformed into combusting and charred human figurines Those incinerated are spared the unprecedented horror that begins to be inflicted on the 1 to 2 million more gravely injured people not yet dead in this first nuclear strike.

Across the Potomac River, the marble walls and columns of the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials super-heat, burst apart, and disintegrate. The steel and stone bridges and highways connecting the surrounding environs heave and collapse. To the south, the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City is obliterated. Ceiling joists, two-by-fours, escalators, chandeliers, rugs, furniture, mannequins, dogs, squirrels, people burst into flames and burn.

Three seconds pass. There's a baseball game going on at Nationals Park. The clothes on a majority of the 35,000 visitors catch on fire. Those who don't quickly burn to death suffer intense third-degree burns, their bodies stripped of the outer layer of skin. Third-degree burns require immediate specialized care to prevent death. Here inside the park there might be a few thousand people who somehow survive initially, people now desperately in need of a bed at a burn treatment center. But all of them are almost certainly now destroyed.

Within seconds, thermal radiation from this nuclear bomb attack on the Pentagon has deeply burned the skin on roughly 1 million more people, 90% of whom will die. Defense scientists and academics alike have spent decades doing this math. Most won't make it more than a few steps from where they happen to be standing when the bomb detonates. They become what civil defense experts referred to in the 1950s, when these gruesome calculations first came to be, as ""Dead When Found."" Humans created the nuclear weapon in the 20th century to save the world from evil, and now, in the 21st century, the nuclear weapon is about to burn it all down.

The science behind the bomb is profound. Embedded in the thermonuclear flash of light are two pulses of thermal radiation. The first pulse lasts a fraction of a second, after which comes the second pulse, which lasts several seconds and causes human skin to ignite and burn. The intense heat that follows creates a high-pressure wave that moves out from its center point like a tsunami, a giant wall of highly compressed air traveling faster than the speed of sound. It mows people down, hurls others into the air, bursts lungs and eardrums, sucks bodies up and spits them out.

As the nuclear fireball grows, this shock front delivers catastrophic destruction, pushing out like a bulldozer and moving three miles farther ahead. The air behind the blast wave accelerates, creating several-hundred-mile-per-hour winds. It destroys everything in its immediate path, instantly changing the physical shapes of engineered structures including office buildings, apartment complexes, monuments and museums -- they disintegrate and become dust. That which is not crushed by blast is torn apart by whipping wind. Buildings collapse, bridges fall, cranes topple over. Objects as small as computers and cement blocks, and as large as 18-wheeler trucks and double-decker tour buses, become airborne like tennis balls.

The nuclear fireball rises up like a hot-air balloon. Up from the earth it floats, at a rate of 250 to 350 feet per second. Thirty-five seconds pass. The formation of the iconic mushroom cloud begins, its massive cap and stem, made up of incinerated people and civilization's debris, transmutes from a red, to an brownish-orange hue. Next comes the deadly reverse suction effect, with objects -- cars, people, light poles, street signs, parking meters, steel carrier beams -- getting sucked back into the center of the burning inferno and consumed by flame.

Sixty seconds pass. The cap stretches out some 30 miles. Radioactive particles rain down on the Earth and its people as deadly fallout. More than a million are dead or dying. Less than two minutes have passed. Now the inferno begins, different from the initial fireball; it is a mega-fire beyond measure. Gas lines explode one after the next, spewing steady streams of fire. Tanks containing flammable materials burst open. Chemical factories explode. Pilot lights on water heaters and furnaces act like torch lighters, setting anything not already burning alight. Collapsed buildings become like giant ovens. People, everywhere, burn alive.

Open gaps in floors and roofs behave like chimneys. Carbon dioxide from the firestorms sinks down and settles into the metro's subway tunnels, asphyxiating riders in their seats. People seeking shelter in basements and other spaces below ground vomit, convulse, become comatose, and die. Anyone aboveground who is looking directly at the blast -- in some cases as far as 13 miles away -- becomes blinded.

Seven and a half miles out from ground zero (in the 5 psi zone), cars and buses crash into one another. Asphalt streets turn to liquid from the intense heat, trapping survivors as if caught in molten lava. Hurricane-force winds fuel hundreds of fires into thousands of fires, into millions of them. Hot burning ash and flaming wind-borne debris ignite new fires, and one after another they conflate. All of Washington, DC, becomes one complex firestorm. A mega-inferno. Soon to become a mesocyclone of fire. Eight, maybe nine minutes pass.

Ten miles out from ground zero, survivors shuffle in shock like the almost dead. Unsure of what just happened, desperate to escape. Tens of thousands of people here have ruptured lungs. Crows, sparrows, and pigeons flying over-head catch on fire and drop from the sky as if it is raining birds.

The localized electromagnetic pulse of the bomb obliterates all radio, internet, and TV. There's no electricity. No phone service. No 911. Cars with electric ignition systems in a several-mile ring outside the blast zone cannot restart. Water stations can't pump water. Saturated with lethal levels of radiation, the entire area is a no-go zone for first responders. Not for days will rare survivors realize help was never on the way. Those who somehow manage to escape death by the initial blast, shock wave, and firestorm suddenly comprehend an insidious truth about nuclear war. That they're entirely on their own.

How, and why, do US defense scientists know such hideous things, and with exacting precision? How does the US government know so many nuclear effects-related facts, while the general public remains blind?

BOSTON (AP) -- It may officially be spring, but New England was battling a wintry weather combination across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski country, and rain, wind and possible flooding in southern areas and along the coast.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

Power was out for all of Tanglewood Mall for much of the day, completely disrupting stores throughout the mall. The mall's entrances were closed into the afternoon due to the outage.

Organizers of the annual comic convention were initially planning for a late start once power returned. Delays eventually squashed those plans, leading to an announcement on Facebook shortly before 10 a.m. that the convention would be canceled.

The post stated a reschedule date will be announced soon.

Real estate consultant Colliers India has released the data on the office market for the January-March period, nine days before the closing of the current quarter.

As per the data, the total gross leasing of office space is estimated to rise to 13.6 million square feet across six major cities -- Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune -- during the first quarter of 2024.

The leasing stood at 10.1 million square feet (sq ft) in the year-ago period.

The demand is set to grow in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR, but may fall in Chennai.

In Pune, the demand is likely to remain flat at 0.8 million sq ft.

According to the data, the leasing of office space in Hyderabad is estimated to jump more than two times to 2.9 million square feet during January-March from 1.3 million square feet in the year-ago period.

In Mumbai, the demand is expected to surge 90 per cent to 1.9 million sq ft from 1 million sq ft.

Office space leasing in Bengaluru is set to rise 25 per cent to 4 million sq ft from 3.2 million sq ft.

In Delhi-NCR, the demand is expected to rise 14 per cent to 2.5 million sq ft from 2.2 million sq ft.

Office demand in Chennai is estimated to fall 6 per cent to 1.5 million sq ft during January-March this year compared to 1.6 million square feet in the year-ago period.

Gross absorption or leasing data does not include lease renewals, pre- commitments and those deals where only a letter of intent has been signed.

When asked about the reason for releasing the data well before the quarter ends, Colliers India said the company ""considers only closed transactions while accounting for the gross absorption (leasing) numbers. Larger and major deals expected to close have been factored in, as only 3 working days of the quarter are left in the coming week"".

Commenting on the trend, Arpit Mehrotra, Managing Director-Office Services, Colliers India, said Hyderabad continues to strengthen its role as a prominent commercial office market in the country.

""The city offers occupiers, including Global Capability Centers, considerable price arbitrage compared to other markets,"" he added.

Mehrotra noted that the government policies, continuous infrastructure upgrades and a favourable business ecosystem make Hyderabad a compelling destination for investors, occupiers, and leading real estate developers.

During Q1, Colliers India Senior Director and Research Head Vimal Nadar said, the occupiers from technology, engineering and manufacturing, and BFSI sectors collectively accounted for 58 per cent of total leasing activity across the top 6 cities.

On the office market, flexible office space operator Urban Vault co-founder and CEO Amal Mishra said the office demand continues to be strong across major cities from domestic and global companies, driven by high economic growth, cost-effective real estate and availability of skilled talent.

""The demand for flexible workspace, including managed office space, is also growing,"" said Mishra, who has many centres in Bengaluru.",dailypioneer.com,news,The Pioneer,,-0.1215686274509804,448926750,1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The revised ordinance caps utility-scale solar operations at 50 acres under panel, a measure intended to limit the scope of such operations. At a joint meeting Tuesday, the Amherst County Planning Commission recommended approval of the ordinance with an added measure to cap 10 megawatts of solar-generated power, but supervisors opted to not include that action.

""As long as we don't go over 50 acres, why do we care,"" Supervisor Tom Martin said of the 10-megawatt limit.

Tyler Creasy, director of community development, said the 10-megawatt measure would have allowed applicants flexibility to apply for a special exception permit to go above that level. Supervisor Chris Adams said he felt the 10-megawatt suggested rule and variance through a second special use permit would have created more unnecessary work for the commission and board.

The board in recent years approved two utility-scale solar projects at 10 megawatts or less but a third project proposed by Energix Renewables, an Alexandria-based company, drew the most heat. The 50-megawatt proposed project just off Virginia 151 in Piney River close to the Nelson County border was twice given a vote of denial from the commission and in February received the supervisors' unanimous rejection.

The denial for what would have been the county's largest utility-scale solar farm to date centered mainly on effects to scenic views, environmental-related concerns and a sentiment some residents and county leaders expressed that the power generated would benefit areas outside of Amherst County.

Creasy said measures in the revised ordinance include retaining qualified third-party reviewers for building, erosion and sediment inspections and review, a vegetative buffer of 40 feet and requiring a decommissioning plan for discarded panels every five years. All utility-scale solar is required by special exception permits only in the county, a process that requires special review and public hearings from the commission and board before final action is taken.

To counteract circumventing the ordinance in a way to protect the natural beauty and viewshed, Creasy said another new measure ensures no solar farm is located within a mile of any other existing utility-scale solar facility. Solar companies, if approved for projects, through the new ordinance are required to provide materials and training to emergency responders.

""This allows our emergency services to kind of have a heads-up for when these developments are happening and then after it's already been established they have a plan if anything happens,"" Creasy said.

The board also approved a change to the county's comprehensive plan for growth and development that promotes solar generation facilities to locate east of U.S. 29 Business and in areas that do not have a negative impact on adjoining property or county residents.

""The land is a little bit more flat towards the east of U.S. 29,"" Creasy said. ""The substations in which these facilities must hook up to are typically located east of U.S. 29 Business.""

Creasy said solar farm requests west of U.S. 29 could still go forward, noting the comprehensive plan change states where the county prefers them to go.

Jeannie Johnson, a North Carolina resident affiliated with a utility-scale solar developer working on a project in the early stages in the county, said during a public hearing Tuesday she feels Amherst County's ordinance allows for responsible solar development but asked to not include the 50-acre cap and not allowing them within a mile of another solar site.

""When we're developing projects, the larger the project the more means of scale that we can reach, the bigger the impact to the local communities and the cheaper electricity we can provide to the grid,"" Johnson said, adding both measures she asked the board to consider removing directly affects private property rights. ""I want to make sure that our landowners can have an opportunity to do what they think is best for the land and I just want to urge the commission and board to consider that.

Johnson said ""thoughtful, responsibly developed solar projects"" could be developed beyond the 50-acre under panel rule and those could be extensively screened beyond the 40-foot vegetative buffer.

""So they really can remain out of sight, out of mind, and counties can benefit from economic development,"" Johnson said.

Geri Dokos, a Piney River resident, staunchly opposed to the proposed Energix project, said she favors the revised ordinance.

""I think this protects the natural beauty of one of the most beautiful places in the world,"" Dokos told county officials. ""And I want to thank you all for so far keeping this solar in control.""

She said she believes in the next few years technology advancements in the solar industry will take up a lot less acreage and be less of an eyesore to the county's benefit.

Amherst County resident Sam Bryant thanked the board and commission for keeping natural resources clean and safe by not backing the Energix project that according to company representatives would have provided about $10 million in tax revenue over the operation's lifespan of 45 years.

""With these large solar projects, these landowners get money but everybody else loses,"" Bryant told the board and commissioners. ""Thank you for not taking the bait.""

Elon resident Abby Thompson thanked county officials for ensuring a public hearing process is in place with the special exception requirement.

""This is technology and we do to have to address it, but you're addressing it in a very responsible way,"" Thompson said.

Commissioner Jim Thompson said the group took months to give the zoning changes a comprehensive look with the intent to protect the county's natural beauty and regulate such uses in a responsible way. He said he felt the commission was open-minded and fair in its review.

Commissioner Michael Bryant also was in favor of lifting the 10-megawatt cap, pointing out his concern the county would get flooded with variance requests to go above that. ""The efficiency is getting better, it's going to continue to get better,"" Bryant said of solar technologies. ""I think 50 acres is a good size.""

Commission Chair Derin Foor agreed the ordinance changes are in the county's best interests.

""I don't think we have to sacrifice our natural beauty, etc., for someone else's benefit,"" Foor said.

Drew Wade, the board's chair, suggested bumping the acreage cap above 50 but did not get any support from other supervisors.

""I think the whole purpose of this ordinance was to limit the size and scope of solar farms,"" Pugh said. ""I think 50 acres is the size I would like to see. Fifty acres is a pretty large piece of property. I have no desire to increase the acreage.""

Supervisor Tom Martin agreed and said besides solar company representatives he hasn't heard anyone ""beating our door down"" in pushing for large-scale solar farms on extensive acreage.

""I don't think there is anything wrong with the county setting good standards,"" Martin said of the 50-acre cap.

County Attorney Mark Popovich said ""the elephant in the room"" is the expectation the Virginia General Assembly may take action next year that will bypass localities' review of utility-scale solar and shift it to the State Corporation Commission. The board of supervisors recently wrote Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, who represents the county, opposing any intervention by the state.

Popovich said the solar industry lobby is ""very strong"" and the state is looking for a certain level of wattage to be provided from solar and if localities stand in the way, the state moving to step in ""is the reality we face right now.""

""I think Amherst County has been very clear on what our position is,"" Supervisor Claudia Tucker said.

Two tries in the opening half and three after the break did the business for the URC leaders as they secured a try-bonus point with a routine win.

""Zebre made us work very hard, especially in the opening half,"" said man of the match Luke McGrath. ""But we are delighted with the team effort and are just delighted to get the points on the road.""

Leinster laid down an early marker when Rob Russell looped around from his right wing to take a pass from Liam Turner and race in for his fifth try in nine games this term.

Ross Byrne added the conversion but Leinster struggled to build on that bright start and they lost centre Turner to be bin after 21 minutes for a head challenge on Zebre out-half Geronimo Prisciantelli.

The Italians made the extra man count with a superb try after Leinster lost their third lineout of the opening half. Zebre countered quickly, Argentine Prisciantelli changing the point of attack with a perfectly weighted crosskick to the right which winger Scott Gregory fed back inside for full-back Jacopo Trulla to collect and run in an excellent score which Prisciantelli converted to tie the game.

Andrew Osborne then crowned his senior debut with a neat chip and chase down the left after experienced scrum-half McGrath had created the initial opening by going down the blindside, and it was finished in style by Osborne, with brother Jamie one of the first on hand to congratulate him.

Turner returned from the bin and then six minutes from the interval Zebre were temporarily reduced to 14 when openside flanker Iacopo Bianchi got a rush of blood to the head and shot out of the line and took out Will Connors off the ball.

Leinster, ahead 14-7, got on top after the restart, with former Newbridge College star Diarmuid Mangan coming on for his senior debut and making an immediate impression.

Scrum-half McGrath almost scored from inside his own half, sniping down the left wing and escaping the clutches of scrum-half Gonzalo Garcia and winger Gregory before Prisciantelli got back and bundled him into touch.

However, Zebre made a mess of the lineout and Leinster pounced, working the ball across the field as Max Deegan, with a bit of help from Ross Byrne who was outside him, somehow stayed in play to offload inside and McGrath was there to score in the right corner for his seventh try in the URC against Zebre and bring his points haul for Leinster to 250.

The bonus point came on 50 minutes. Turner exploded through the home cover and while he was eventually nabbed, the recycle was quick and Scott Penny had the easiest of tasks to touch down his 33rd Leinster try under the posts.

Byrne converted and the lead was out to 26-7 as both sides continued to empty their benches as the game headed for an inevitable conclusion, with the highly promising 20-year-old Conor O'Tighearnaigh coming on for his debut ten minutes from time when he replaced Ross Molony.

Replacement scrum-half Fintan Gunne set up Russell for his second try in the closing stages to round off the win.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

Argentines' efforts to preserve their savings amid the ongoing decline of their national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), has resulted in the nation recently hitting its highest demand for Bitcoin in 20 months, according to a recent report.

On March 20, Bloomberg reported data sourced from cryptocurrency exchange Lemon Cash revealing nearly 35,000 customers in Argentina purchased Bitcoin in the week ending March 10, which is double the weekly average compared to 2023.

A major factor for the increase in demand is the ongoing decline of the nation's currency.

Over the past twelve months, the ARS value against the US dollar has plummeted, dropping from 0.0049 USD per ARS in March 2023 to 0.0012 USD at the time of publication.

However, it was noted that Lemon wasn't the only platform seeing a surge in demand. Other major exchanges in Argentina, such as Ripio and Belo, reported similar trends.

According to the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, Manuel Beaudroi, stablecoin purchases in Argentina declined from 70% to 60% as Bitcoin's recent price surge attracted more interest.

""The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.""

He also claimed that Belo has seen volume in Bitcoin and Ether increase ""tenfold so far in 2024 compared to the same period last year.""

However, a recent report suggests that interest in stablecoins might still exist, as Argentines are possibly choosing not to use the well-known exchanges within the country for purchasing them.

On Feb. 12 Cointelegraph reported that Argentines are using black market exchanges, known locally as ""crypto caves,"" to buy USD stablecoins in an effort to escape strict currency controls and the rising inflation of the ARS.

Meanwhile, the use of digital currency for specific transactions is slowly gaining traction within the country.

In December 2023, Diana Mondino, the minister of foreign affairs, international trade and worship, claimed that a decree aimed at economic reform and deregulation would allow the use of Bitcoin and other cryptos in the country under certain conditions.

Following the ruling, a local landlord and a tenant in Rosario, the third most populated city in Argentina, sealed a rental agreement where the latter would pay monthly rent in Bitcoin.",conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,0.09019607843137245,448926497,1,https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/22d2d0cf-b428-4ebc-9f2b-d21c5661.jpg?itok=_J-HYjV3,

This is the only safe time to look directly at the sun without solar eclipse glasses. If you observe the sun's corona during totality, you may see dark-pink towers and loops of electrically charged plasma stretching many times the diameter of Earth into space. During the last total solar eclipse, in Australia on April 20, 2023, these ""prominences"" were spectacular -- and vast.

These prominences will almost certainly be on show during totality in North America on April 8, because the sun is likely at the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, known as solar maximum.

Prominences can be visible for days -- you can look at them anytime you want, if you use a hydrogen alpha telescope -- but there are a couple of other rare phenomena you might be able to witness during totality. Here's what solar activity to look for during the total solar eclipse.

""If we get lucky, a CME will present itself as a twisted, spiral-like structure, high in the atmosphere in the sun,"" Ryan French, a solar physicist at the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, Colorado, and author of ""The Sun: Beginner's Guide to Our Local Star (Collins, 2023), told Space.com. A CME is a huge ejection of magnetic field and plasma mass from the sun's corona. It moves fast but looks stationary over a few hours.

""What this does mean, however, is that the same eruption could be seen in Rochester as it was in Dallas, at different stages of the same long-duration eruption,"" French said.

It will take 100 minutes for the moon's shadow to cross North America, so a CME could go off just before and be visible to everyone under a clear sky.

CMEs can certainly happen during totality. One was imaged on Dec. 14, 2020, during the ""Great Patagonian Eclipse"" in Chile, when the sun was close to solar minimum.

Although three solar flares that reached X class -- the highest-intensity level -- went off during one week in February, it's highly unlikely that one will be seen during totality.

""A solar flare is different to a CME -- it's located far lower in the sun's atmosphere, closer to the moon's edge, and would be visible for only a few minutes,"" French said. ""These would appear similar to low-altitude prominences, visible as red loops closer to the sun's surface.""

However, the timing and position of a solar flare and a CME would have to be just right. ""To be visible from Earth, it needs to be located above the sun's edge -- so as not to get blocked by the moon -- during the few minutes of totality,"" French said.

Appearance: Red towers and loops stretching from the sun's surface into the corona

Previous sightings: 1919 and 1946

We'll see prominences during totality on April 8. ""Prominences come in a large range of sizes and are more common during solar maximum,"" French said. ""Sometimes prominences erupt, untethering from the sun's surface and expanding into the solar system.""

That would be a spectacular sight, but what eclipse chasers really want to see are ""giant eruptive"" prominences -- preferably detached from the sun's surface and free-floating in the corona.

""There have been a few examples of such prominence eruptions over the past few months, each of which would have given a great show if occurring during a total solar eclipse,"" French said. ""But it's worth noting that the eclipse will still provide a view of stationary, non-eruptive prominences; they'll just be smaller and closer to the sun's surface than they would be mid-eruption.""

""The problem with eclipses is that they only last a few minutes, so you can't usually take measurements over time,"" Amir Caspi, principal scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com. ""However, the sun is incredibly dynamic; some processes take minutes or even seconds, such as a solar flare or a CME,"" Caspi said.

Given that it's unlikely that such brief events will occur during totality, there's only one solution: to make totality longer. One way to extend it is to get in a supersonic jet and chase the moon's shadow. Scientists did that in 1973 using Concorde, achieving a 73-minute totality.

The alternative is to film the eclipsed sun for a few minutes from across an entire continent, hoping that someone, somewhere, will catch the beginning or end of an event. That rarely happens, but it will on April 8. That day, totality will arrive in the U.S. in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and leave in Maine at 3:35 pm EDT -- a total of 68 minutes.

The Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE 2024) project, which Caspi leads, is an attempt to make a continuous 60-minute 3D movie of the sun's corona in polarized light, using 35 teams of three or four citizen scientists. Each will use standardized cameras and setups and hope to get lucky with the sun.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1058823529411765,448926476,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cBBQvOxP6p7lhyJfCdqJEw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/space_311/3aaa75c2b5bca70aff7dca8a05818ffb,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that had already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters called for anywhere from 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals were expected to be somewhat lower at 6 inches up to a foot (15 to 30 centimeters) with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm was expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain was expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday was expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 centimeters) of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot (30 centimeters) earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There was a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens, and police warned motorists about standing water on highways throughout the city. The storm delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Forecasters predicted possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph in New York. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning was in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) were possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, along with about a half-foot (15 centimeters) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91-mph (147-mph) wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain, south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,370 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of a winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from some wet weather.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping,"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry.

(KNWA/KFTA) -- Sonic Drive-In recently unveiled a new menu item to give fans an ""out-of-this-world experience"" ahead of the total solar eclipse on April 8, according to a news release.

The fast food chain announced the new Blackout Slush Float will be available at locations nationwide starting on March 25 for a limited time.

The all-black slush, meant to represent the temporary darkness from the solar eclipse, is cotton candy and dragonfruit flavored and topped with ice cream.

A pair of solar eclipse glasses comes with each purchase of the Blackout Slush Float, while supplies last, according to Sonic.

""There are over 400 Sonic locations in areas where the total solar eclipse will be visible, and we thought, what better way to create some fun for our fans as they experience this unique event than by introducing a new treat that's as awe-inspiring as the eclipse itself?""

Folks here suffered through the filth that plant generated, the wind blowing dust off the giant black piles onto their houses and cars and everything else. Clunky mechanical conveyors carried the fuel up into the plant at all hours.

""It would make this noise, 'Da-da-da-da-da,' day and night,"" recalled Barbara Kelly, who lives nearby.

For years, Kelly, her neighbors, and an army of environmentalists fought to get rid of the coal plant. It finally closed in 2014.

Now the future will rise in its place. Part of the site will become the Salem Offshore Wind Terminal, a hub for storing and assembling the components for wind turbines installed up and down the coast of New England.

It's a massive project, and for a time it will be pretty disruptive for neighbors who have already put up with a lot. But the residents -- many part of the Salem Alliance for the Environment -- who fought to shut down the coal plant were always going to back using the site to support the offshore wind industry.

It's not just because they directly suffered from their proximity to fossil fuel power. They are also being confronted regularly by the effects of climate change, with more frequent high tides and storm surges bringing water flooding into their neighborhoods from Collins Cove and elsewhere. Threats that imminent can get a community to YIMBY pretty quickly when it comes to clean energy.

""Salem is a community aware of the climate crisis,"" said Mayor Dominick Pangallo, who grew up a mile from the coal pile. ""The sea can sink us, but it can also save us.""

But overwhelming support for the new plant did not make residents here pushovers. In addition to environmental benefits clean power would bring, they were looking for direct community benefits, too, even though they had less leverage than opponents might have enjoyed.

""Community benefit agreements are set up for people who don't want a project,"" said Bonnie Bain, offshore wind program manager at SAFE.

Despite that, SAFE refused to be sidelined. They gathered a phalanx of neighborhood groups, united in a way they hadn't been before, and backed up by heavy hitters like the Conservation Law Foundation. Its members had helped Pangallo get elected. He agreed to give them a seat at the negotiating table with Crowley Maritime Corp., the company developing the site.

""It's going to happen, so let's make it happen to the best of our ability,"" Kelly said, standing at the water's edge on a recent frosty morning.

They demanded, and got, increased funding for climate resiliency, pathways for local students and workers -- especially women and minorities -- into clean energy jobs, funding for affordable housing, and, importantly, a working group to make sure Crowley keeps its promises.

The agreement isn't perfect. Community and environmental activists didn't get everything they were seeking. But they got enough to make activists in Maine and California take notice, and seek out their advice on negotiating with companies bringing wind power plants to their communities.

The people of Salem deserve every concession they've gotten so far, and more. Clean energy is vital to our survival, but it also comes with costs for those who host its infrastructure -- as the vehement opposition to wind farms off the Cape and islands demonstrates. And we are going to need a lot more of it, including in communities unaccustomed to hosting infrastructure.

In Salem, the neighborhoods around the staging facility will see more traffic and noise, especially between the time the project gets underway in April and its expected completion in 2026. It's only right that Crowley soften the blow for a community that has, after all, already suffered more than enough.

Now, this city that epitomized our dirty past will be a beacon for Massachusetts, a symbol of how we can all move forward -- courtesy of the same wind that once blackened its homes.",bostonglobe.com,news,The Boston Globe,,-0.0980392156862745,448925994,1,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/xkQBM4PbaLhXRnrqvYwmBq2EX8I=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/NQFRVGKGJNCHROJKGUVU6Q5O2E.jpg,

It got a bit too hot in the kitchen for the Miami Heat on Friday, the last before Easter weekend. The New Orleans Pelicans just brought too much smoke off the bench to start the spring cookout season, beating Miami 111-88 in South Beach.

Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall added a bit of extra spice to the meeting, too. This was expected since they were both suspended for an altercation that occurred the last time these two teams squared up in late February.

Willie Green's Pelicans know Alvarado stays amped up. Green and Alvarado had to hug out a sideline dustup once this season already. Still, whether it's a flop of a night performance-wise or a fight-of-the-night rumble, New Orleans knows what to expect from their brash bench options. The third-year coach appreciates how Alvarado and Marshall can put the past behind them and move on with the season.

""Incredible effort tonight by our bench,"" Green complimented. ""They didn't have a great game against Orlando but they came out tonight and they responded right away. Jose, Naji, Larry (Nance Jr.). (Jonas Valanciunas) and Trey (Murphy III) are kind of going back and forth. But collectively as a group, it was a big-time win for us.

""Jose and Naji are our energy guys,"" continued Green. ""They are the emotional leaders on our team. When they bring it like they do, it galvanizes the group. It was fun, it was fun to see those guys respond after not having the game they wanted to have (against the Orlando Magic).""

Green also publicly shared that he allowed the locker room to take Friday's game a bit more personally. That message got back to the Pelicans social media team as well judging by the troll job published as soon as the final buzzer sounded.

""For sure, it was a little extra,"" Green explained. ""They said some things in the media. We heard it. Our guys wanted to respond and that's the deal. That is what makes this fun. That is what makes sports fun. You get a little trash talk back and forth. Then you get to go out on the floor and compete against each other. That's what it was tonight. It was two teams competing, trying to make plays...and we're glad to be on the winning side.""

Jose Alvarado outplays Jimmy Butler in Pelicans win

Alvarado matched Jimmy Butler's scoring, finishing with 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Butler had five assists and four rebounds. Marshall added 13 points, seven rebounds, an assist, and a steal. The duo played a combined 54 minutes after being challenged pregame to bring their usual intensity.

""It was huge. I was hurt in that game so I was in the back when everything went down,"" CJ McCollum said of Alvarado and Marshall. ""They were great and responded really well. Coach challenged them before the game to be themselves, to be their best selves. Be aggressive and impact the game. We got arguably the best bench in the league and they showed it tonight.""

The two undrafted, minimum-level contract guys brought maximum effort against the Heat. But they do that every night, a known fact for anyone paying attention to the Pelicans. It's a big reason why Alvarado and Marshall are two of the most beloved players in franchise history. Their spark off the bench has led to some of the team's most memorable moments, not to mention the crowd-pleasing, winning basketball its largely played since relocating to New Orleans.

Alvarado and Marshall can add to those legacies by helping the Pelicans on a deep playoff run this spring, though neither will likely ever have to pay for a drink in the city ever again regardless.",clutchpoints.com,news,ClutchPoints,Chris Dodson,-0.003921568627450966,448925671,1,https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pelicans-use-reserve-energy-to-fuel-revenge-win-over-heat.jpg,eng-9419358

Liu, Purdue University

Small-scale solar power, also known as rooftop or distributed solar, has grown considerably in the U.S. over the past decade. It provides electricity without emitting air pollutants or climate-warming greenhouse gases, and it meets local energy demand without requiring costly investments in transmission and distribution systems.

However, its expansion is making it harder for electric utilities and power grid managers to design fair and efficient retail electricity rates - the prices that households pay.

Under traditional electricity pricing, customers pay one charge per kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption that covers both the energy they use and the fixed costs of maintaining the grid. As more people adopt rooftop solar, they buy less energy from the grid. Fewer customers are left to shoulder utilities' fixed costs, potentially making power more expensive for everyone.

This trend can drive more customers to leave the system and raise prices further - a scenario known as the utility death spiral. One 2018 study calculated that two-thirds of recent electricity distribution cost increases at California's three investor-owned utilities were associated with the growth of residential solar.

With abundant sun and solar-friendly policies, California has 36% of U.S. small-scale solar capacity, much more than any other state. And the state is engaged in a heated debate over pricing electricity in ways designed to make energy less expensive for low-income households.

We study energy markets and public policy affecting energy and the environment, and have analyzed various retail electricity rate structures and their economic impacts on power producers and consumers. Our key finding is that an income-based, fixed-charge rate structure of the type that California is currently considering offers the most efficient and equitable solution - if it is designed correctly.

The debate over fixed charges began in 2022, when the California Legislature enacted an energy bill that ordered state regulators to study income-based fixed charges and decide whether to adopt them by July 1, 2024. Then the state's three largest utilities - Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas & Electric - submitted a proposal to the state Public Utilities Commission in mid-2023 that would separate retail bills into two parts: a fixed charge and a variable charge.

The fixed charge would be a preset monthly fee, independent of energy usage but tied to income levels, so wealthier customers would pay a larger share of grid maintenance costs. The variable charge would be based on the amount of electricity consumed and would cover the actual costs of electricity production and delivery.

Historically, these actual costs have typically ranged between 4 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Today, the average residential rate in California often exceeds 30 cents per kilowatt-hour because it covers fixed costs as well as electricity use.

A two-part billing system that separates fixed costs from variable usage charges offers potential benefits for both consumers and utilities.

For utilities, the fixed charge offers a stable revenue stream. The companies know how many households they serve, and they can plan on the fixed amounts that those households will pay each month. Households that go solar would still pay the fixed charge, since most of them draw electricity from the grid when the sun doesn't shine.

This approach provides financial stability for the utility and access to the grid for all. Consumers would benefit because with a certain amount of income guaranteed, utilities could charge significantly less per kilowatt-hour for the actual electricity that households use.

One significant concern is that if electricity costs less, people may use more of it, which could undermine efforts toward energy conservation and lead to an increase in emissions. In our view, the way to address this risk is by fine-tuning the two-part billing structure so that it covers only a portion of the utilities' costs through fixed charges and incorporates the rest into the variable usage rates.

Put another way, combining a lower fixed charge with a higher variable charge would ensure that utilities can still cover their fixed costs effectively, while encouraging mindful energy use among consumers. Ensuring affordable electricity for consumers, fair cost recovery for utilities and overall fairness and efficiency in the energy market requires striking a delicate balance.

Another argument from critics, often labeled ""energy socialism,"" asserts that higher-income households might end up subsidizing excessive electricity use by lower-income households under the income-based rate structure. In our view, this perception is inaccurate.

Wealthy households would pay more to maintain the grid, via larger fixed charges, than poorer households, but would not subsidize lower-income households' energy use. All income groups would pay the same rate for each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity that they use. Decisions on energy use would remain economically driven, regardless of consumers' income level.

While our research supports California utilities' approach in principle, we believe their proposal has shortcomings - notably in the proposed income brackets.

As currently framed, households with annual incomes between US$28,000 and $69,000 would pay a fixed fee of $20 to $34 per month. Households earning between $69,000 and $180,000 would pay $51 to $73 per month, and those earning more than $180,000 would pay $85 to $128.

The middle-income bracket starts just above California's median household income. Consequently, nearly half of all California households could find themselves paying a substantial monthly fee - $51 to $73 - regardless of their actual electricity usage.

It could be hard to convince consumers to pay significant fixed fees for intangible services, especially middle-income residents who have either gone solar or may do so. Not surprisingly, the proposal has encountered considerable pushback from the solar industry.

In response to public outcry, California lawmakers recently introduced Assembly Bill 1999, which would replace the income-graduated fixed-charge requirement with fixed charges of $5 per month for low-income customers and up to $10 per month for others. In our view, this reaction goes too far in the other direction.

Capping fixed charges at such low levels would force utilities to hike their energy use rates to cover fixed costs - again, risking the death spiral scenario. Our research indicates that there is a range for the fixed charge that would cover a reasonable share of utilities' fixed costs, but is not high enough to burden consumers.

Without utility cost data, we can't pinpoint this range precisely. However, based on estimates of utilities' costs, we believe the caps proposed in AB 1999 are too low and could end up unfairly burdening those the bill aims to protect.

In our research, based on a hypothetical case study, we found a sweet spot in which fixed charges cover about 40% of utilities' fixed costs. Charges at this level provide maximum benefit to consumers, although they reduce energy producers' profits.

Our findings are similar to an alternative proposal jointly presented by The Utility Reform Network, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This plan suggests a two-part rate structure with an average fixed charge of about $36 per month. Low-income households would pay $5 per month, and those earning over $150,000 yearly would pay about $62.

We believe this proposal moves in the right direction by ensuring fair contributions to grid costs, while also encouraging efficient energy use and investment in clean energy infrastructure. It could act as a guide for other U.S. states searching for methods to balance utility fixed-cost recovery with fair pricing and continued growth of small-scale solar power.

Although it is not the first time that he has mentioned the possibility of a nuclear war scenario in the context of the current conflict with Ukraine, he added that he does not think it will reach that point just yet.

When asked if Russia was ready for a nuclear war, the 71-year-old leader said: ""From a military-technical point of view, we are, of course, ready.""

However, he added: ""(In the U.S.) there are enough specialists in the field of Russian-American relations and in the field of strategic restraint. Therefore, I don't think that here everything is rushing to it (nuclear confrontation), but we are ready for this.""

He did say, however, that if the U.S. were to carry out any nuclear tests, Russia could conduct tests of their own in response.

Although the White House has yet to comment on Putin's latest remarks, it has stated in the past that there have not been any signs that Russia is about to use nuclear weapons despite what it termed ""nuclear saber-rattling"" by Putin. Some experts believe, however, that the warnings from Putin and others in the Russian government are simply propaganda aimed at intimidating the West.

The U.S. has been struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the situation, particularly the question of whether to send even more aid to Ukraine. Russia currently controls around one fifth of Ukrainian territory and is rearming itself significantly faster than Ukraine, whose army is suffering from low morale and insufficient supplies.

The Biden administration wants to send additional support to Kiev, but many in the U.S. are angry about the amount of money that has already been spent to assist them - especially when you consider the fact that Ukraine is not faring well against Russia despite receiving a considerable amount of material and financial support from the U.S. and other Western nations.

Putin also said that he would like to hold talks about Ukraine, but the U.S. believes that he is not ready for serious discussions on the matter. The director of the CIA, William Burns, who previously served as an ambassador to Russia, recently told the Senate Intelligence Committee that it would be in America's best interest to wait until Ukraine is in a stronger position before any talks are held about a ceasefire.

For his part, Putin insists that he does not trust anyone and that he will require written security guarantees should there be a settlement. He stated: ""I don't trust anyone, but we need guarantees, and guarantees must be spelled out, they must be such that we would be satisfied.""",naturalnews.com,news,NaturalNews.com,,-0.1843137254901961,448925239,1,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/03/Nuclear-Bomb-Explosion-Atom-Nuke-Mushroom-Cloud.jpg,eng-9416882

Liu, Purdue University

Small-scale solar power, also known as rooftop or distributed solar, has grown considerably in the U.S. over the past decade. It provides electricity without emitting air pollutants or climate-warming greenhouse gases, and it meets local energy demand without requiring costly investments in transmission and distribution systems.

However, its expansion is making it harder for electric utilities and power grid managers to design fair and efficient retail electricity rates - the prices that households pay.

Under traditional electricity pricing, customers pay one charge per kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption that covers both the energy they use and the fixed costs of maintaining the grid. As more people adopt rooftop solar, they buy less energy from the grid. Fewer customers are left to shoulder utilities' fixed costs, potentially making power more expensive for everyone.

This trend can drive more customers to leave the system and raise prices further - a scenario known as the utility death spiral. One 2018 study calculated that two-thirds of recent electricity distribution cost increases at California's three investor-owned utilities were associated with the growth of residential solar.

With abundant sun and solar-friendly policies, California has 36% of U.S. small-scale solar capacity, much more than any other state. And the state is engaged in a heated debate over pricing electricity in ways designed to make energy less expensive for low-income households.

We study energy markets and public policy affecting energy and the environment, and have analyzed various retail electricity rate structures and their economic impacts on power producers and consumers. Our key finding is that an income-based, fixed-charge rate structure of the type that California is currently considering offers the most efficient and equitable solution - if it is designed correctly.

The debate over fixed charges began in 2022, when the California Legislature enacted an energy bill that ordered state regulators to study income-based fixed charges and decide whether to adopt them by July 1, 2024. Then the state's three largest utilities - Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas & Electric - submitted a proposal to the state Public Utilities Commission in mid-2023 that would separate retail bills into two parts: a fixed charge and a variable charge.

The fixed charge would be a preset monthly fee, independent of energy usage but tied to income levels, so wealthier customers would pay a larger share of grid maintenance costs. The variable charge would be based on the amount of electricity consumed and would cover the actual costs of electricity production and delivery.

Historically, these actual costs have typically ranged between 4 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Today, the average residential rate in California often exceeds 30 cents per kilowatt-hour because it covers fixed costs as well as electricity use.

A two-part billing system that separates fixed costs from variable usage charges offers potential benefits for both consumers and utilities.

For utilities, the fixed charge offers a stable revenue stream. The companies know how many households they serve, and they can plan on the fixed amounts that those households will pay each month. Households that go solar would still pay the fixed charge, since most of them draw electricity from the grid when the sun doesn't shine.

This approach provides financial stability for the utility and access to the grid for all. Consumers would benefit because with a certain amount of income guaranteed, utilities could charge significantly less per kilowatt-hour for the actual electricity that households use.

One significant concern is that if electricity costs less, people may use more of it, which could undermine efforts toward energy conservation and lead to an increase in emissions. In our view, the way to address this risk is by fine-tuning the two-part billing structure so that it covers only a portion of the utilities' costs through fixed charges and incorporates the rest into the variable usage rates.

Put another way, combining a lower fixed charge with a higher variable charge would ensure that utilities can still cover their fixed costs effectively, while encouraging mindful energy use among consumers. Ensuring affordable electricity for consumers, fair cost recovery for utilities and overall fairness and efficiency in the energy market requires striking a delicate balance.

Another argument from critics, often labeled ""energy socialism,"" asserts that higher-income households might end up subsidizing excessive electricity use by lower-income households under the income-based rate structure. In our view, this perception is inaccurate.

Wealthy households would pay more to maintain the grid, via larger fixed charges, than poorer households, but would not subsidize lower-income households' energy use. All income groups would pay the same rate for each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity that they use. Decisions on energy use would remain economically driven, regardless of consumers' income level.

While our research supports California utilities' approach in principle, we believe their proposal has shortcomings - notably in the proposed income brackets.

As currently framed, households with annual incomes between US$28,000 and $69,000 would pay a fixed fee of $20 to $34 per month. Households earning between $69,000 and $180,000 would pay $51 to $73 per month, and those earning more than $180,000 would pay $85 to $128.

The middle-income bracket starts just above California's median household income. Consequently, nearly half of all California households could find themselves paying a substantial monthly fee - $51 to $73 - regardless of their actual electricity usage.

It could be hard to convince consumers to pay significant fixed fees for intangible services, especially middle-income residents who have either gone solar or may do so. Not surprisingly, the proposal has encountered considerable pushback from the solar industry.

In response to public outcry, California lawmakers recently introduced Assembly Bill 1999, which would replace the income-graduated fixed-charge requirement with fixed charges of $5 per month for low-income customers and up to $10 per month for others. In our view, this reaction goes too far in the other direction.

Capping fixed charges at such low levels would force utilities to hike their energy use rates to cover fixed costs - again, risking the death spiral scenario. Our research indicates that there is a range for the fixed charge that would cover a reasonable share of utilities' fixed costs, but is not high enough to burden consumers.

Without utility cost data, we can't pinpoint this range precisely. However, based on estimates of utilities' costs, we believe the caps proposed in AB 1999 are too low and could end up unfairly burdening those the bill aims to protect.

In our research, based on a hypothetical case study, we found a sweet spot in which fixed charges cover about 40% of utilities' fixed costs. Charges at this level provide maximum benefit to consumers, although they reduce energy producers' profits.

Our findings are similar to an alternative proposal jointly presented by The Utility Reform Network, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This plan suggests a two-part rate structure with an average fixed charge of about $36 per month. Low-income households would pay $5 per month, and those earning over $150,000 yearly would pay about $62.

We believe this proposal moves in the right direction by ensuring fair contributions to grid costs, while also encouraging efficient energy use and investment in clean energy infrastructure. It could act as a guide for other U.S. states searching for methods to balance utility fixed-cost recovery with fair pricing and continued growth of small-scale solar power.

""There are all these twists and unanswered questions about what happens to our whanau years down the line with their grief,"" says Edwards.

Driven by a Māori kaupapa, the play deals with mental illness and healing. Edwards says that this is Tainui Tukiwaho's best script in her opinion with complex characters.

Edwards (Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Whare) says without giving too much of the story away, the play takes place in a world between a koro and kuia. They are dealing with the loss of their son to suicide, and 21 years later, they are still dealing with the trauma and grief.

""They still celebrate their son's birthday even though he has passed away,"" says Edwards.

Edwards says of her character, ""Since and before the trauma, she probably has you know, I don't like using terms but borderline personality and you know, has kept the shame and the guilt with her.""

Rehearsals leading up to the show have been intense especially when the show is an hour of real time.

""There's so much emotion that happens in that time.""

It's a human story from a Maori lens and the cast are all Maori, she says.

""Through a Maori lens dealing with the fact that there's 'mate' (sickness) in the room so the principles of anything that is tapu is dealt with in a really protective way with our tikanga.""

Edwards says there is an opportunity to speak if they want to because of the triggering content of the play.

""Our kaupapa around it is really safe... because of the content, we provide a watea, a whakawatea at the end just for people to release or keep us protected.""

In the play, the older couple have isolated themselves from their whanau because of their trauma.

""I'd like to reflect the fact that out there our whanau are really still suffering even though it's years on, the repercussions of losing someone to maui, is yeah still relevant, we forget about them.""

The audience should expect to go on a realistic journey of what happens inside us, in a psychological thriller style.

""It's really emotional, it's really upsetting. There's hope though. It provides a slice of reality which is usually hidden behind closed doors.""

Edwards who plays the character Keri, won the Best Actress award for her role at the Wellington Theatre Awards earlier this year.

Edwards says she did a lot of research about her character and draws inspiration from her friends.

""I've got three mates, wahine in our late fifties, who've all lost their sons to suicide.""

""I just felt really deeply about representing them and reflecting the turmoil and the trauma that they, years later still...""

She says people forget and the world goes on but it doesn't leave the family of those affected by the loss.

""I just want to honour, for me, I can only for my character, from a mama's point of view do the work that I know is true of reflecting who they are.""

Edwards says ""The Sun and the Wind"" is a reminder to the audience to remember that whanau who have lost someone are still grieving and suffering.

""I want them to come to the play... People forget, the world goes on, but it doesn't leave them and I really want if anything whanau to see that.""

The Hyderabad Circuit Bench also summoned PPP MNA Rafique Jamali at the next hearing on April 18 to clarify how the funds allocated for development projects in his city have been utilised.

The court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Gulzar Ali Almani concerning the provision of clean drinking water to Johi, Khairpur Nathan Shah, and Mehar talukas of Dadu. At the previous hearing, the court had granted the government a two-month period to establish water testing labs to assess the quality of water from aquifers used for drinking in these talukas. The government was also directed to install solar-operated RO plants in rural areas.

However, the petitioner filed a contempt petition in the SHC, alleging non-compliance with its orders. During Friday's hearing, Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Asif Hyder Shah appeared before the bench and informed the court that a committee had been formed in accordance with its orders.

Nevertheless, the bench remarked that committees are often formed to oversee activities, but the court expected to see tangible results. The chief secretary was asked to outline the implementation process and funding arrangements. The chief secretary requested three weeks to prepare a plan in line with the SHC's directives. Accepting his plea, the court adjourned the hearing to April 18.

Speaking to the media outside the court, the chief secretary stated that he would endeavour to submit a plan for the provision of drinking water to the three talukas of Dadu within 15 days. He expressed optimism that the plan would not merely remain on paper.

According to the petitioner, three oil and gas companies operate in these talukas but do not allocate adequate funds for water supply, education, and health.

The Lopes accomplished that last Saturday with a 15-point win over UT Arlington in the WAC title game. Now, they're simply expanding on that legacy.

""The only pitch we gave him was I asked him if he wanted a ring,"" GCU junior guard Ray Harrison said.

The Lopes claimed their first NCAA Tournament win Friday night as they defeated No. 5 Saint Mary's 75-66 in Spokane, Wash., on the backs of Grant-Foster and the rest of their transfers.

Six of the seven players that played significant minutes transferred into the program and accounted for 71 of the Lopes' 75 points.

Grant-Foster, who made three collegiate stops before arriving on Camelback Road in Phoenix, knocked in a game-high 22 points and pulled down seven rebounds. It was the fifth time in the last six games he reached the 20-point plateau. In three postseason games, he is averaging 24.0 points per game.

The senior from Kansas City, Kan., is playing in his first season with the Lopes. His journey is a long one as in his debut at DePaul in the 2021-22 season, he was rushed to the hospital, and it appeared his hoops career may be over.

But he refused to let that be the final chapter and found a home at Grand Canyon. More than just finding a place to continue playing, Grant-Foster established a deeper connection with his teammates.

""My side of the recruiting process [with him] was just getting to know Tyon and knowing that regardless of what's on the court, I have a brother for life, and we were going to start building that,"" GCU redshirt senior Gabe McGlothan said. ""That was one of my favorite things.""

That bond among the players has proved pivotal in the transfer portal era. Grand Canyon has 10 transfers among the 15 players on the roster. Those who have been with the program for multiple years, such as Harrison and McGlothan, provided strong pitches to those in the portal.

""They helped us in the recruiting process with this portal process and when guys came on visits like Tyon,"" GCU head coach Bryce Drew said. ""We would always group afterward with Ray and Gabe, 'Do you like them? Do you want them here? Do you want them a part of our family?' I credit these two for really recruiting great transfers for coming to join us. It's been a really fun ride.""

GCU has been a Division I program for 11 years and is making its third appearance in the NCAA Tournament - all in the last four seasons under Drew. The Lopes have improved their seeding each time as well, garnering a 15-seed in 2021, a 14-seed last year and a 12-seed this season.

They have won a program-record 30 games this season and sit at 30-4 on a six-game winning streak (all by at least eight points). During that stretch, the Lopes are holding opponents to 60 points per game in that stretch.

Against Saint Mary's, GCU limited the Gaels to 38.8% shooting and 28% from 3-point land while forcing 13 turnovers.

""We've had a connected team,"" Drew said. ""We've had a team that's been really motivated to win. What I love about them is they really compete. I think you saw that out there... how hard they guarded to the end of [the shot clock] buzzer. They don't have any quit in them. Just really proud of them and the effort they gave for 40 minutes.""

Offensively, the Lopes had four players in double figures. Behind Foster-Grant were Harrison with 17, McGlothan with 12 and Moore with 10.

Last season, GCU fell to Gonzaga in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. It was a game in which the Lopes trailed by just two in the second half before a 24-2 Zags' run put the game out of reach. So, it's a bit of irony, that one year later, Grand Canyon earned its first NCAA Tournament win in the city the Bulldogs call home.

""What brought me to GCU was the winning culture that they were building here and just how much I know Gabe and Ray wanted to win,"" Foster-Grant said. ""When I was on my visit, they talked about that Gonzaga game a lot. I knew it meant a whole lot to them.""

The Lopes have increased their win total each year under Drew going from 17 wins in year one to nearly twice as many this season.

With players from the likes of Kansas, Louisville, Arizona State, Oregon and UNLV among other, GCU has become a hotbed for second chances.

And now the program is 40 minutes away from a spot in the Sweet 16.

In Maine, the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland, forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine, totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cutoff with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm was expected to be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far-southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain also could produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service also has issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions Saturday. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens and delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt roller coasters.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet.

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida, severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""It's that moment when you lose yourself in it. I think somebody who's skateboarding and does a flip would feel the same way when they land it.""

Though Bedingfield attempted to paint her ability in democratic terms, from the outside it seems clearly inborn, not learned.

The 39-year-old Sussex native described her upbringing as ""alternative Christianity,"" and said she wasn't even allowed to listen to the radio. And yet, she had a knack for songwriting from an early age.

""At age 18 or something, I started to have this inner confidence kick in. This feeling of, 'This stuff is good. I just know it's good,'"" she said.

""Pop just means 'popular.' It's anthemic,"" she explained. ""So I just think, 'Can people sing this?'""

The short answer: Yes.

Anyone who's heard a Bedingfield classic at a club or karaoke party can corroborate. And as Emma Stone demonstrated in that iconic ""Easy A"" scene, even if you think you're immune at first, you're wrong.

Since her debut single was released in 2004, Bedingfield has been calling to revelers with chants of raindrops, better days, and ""I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you."" Her optimism remains mesmeric, timeless -- such that, 17 years later, TikTok has embraced a remix of ""Unwritten"" for its most joyful dance challenge yet.

In fact, when Bedingfield met the original choreographers shortly before our phone call, they told her they'd been receiving messages about how the song has touched and changed lives.

""We need connection as humans. That's what entertainment is all about,"" she said. ""You can feel it in your body. You get goosebumps. You want to move. You can't help but move.""

""One of the great things about technology is that it's making people cross genres more,"" she continued. ""While the world is so divided, maybe there's a space where we're actually becoming more connected through music.""

The legend of ""Unwritten"" begins in 2003 with a ""little poem"" tucked away in Bedingfield's trousers.

She had just been signed by Phonogenic Records, a small division of RCA and Sony Music, as the first solo artist on the roster. Then just 21 years old, the young Brit traveled to Los Angeles to work on her debut album.

In the studio one afternoon, Bedingfield mentioned that she had written something for her younger brother.

""He was 14 at the time, so I was like, 'What does a 14-year-old need to hear? What do I wish that I'd heard?'"" she explained.

The concept was simple: Life is a blank page and you hold the pen. But it was met with little enthusiasm.

""The writers that I was working with that day weren't really feeling it. They wanted to write more sexy songs,"" she explained. ""So I just put the poem in my pocket and I thought, 'I'll save it for a different session.'""

The next day, Bedingfield had a session with producer Wayne Rodrigues and songwriter Danielle Brisebois, whom she'd never met.

""Danielle just bounced into the room with this really amazing energy and I was like, 'This is who I want to write the song with,'"" Bedingfield said.

In a separate interview, Brisebois told a remarkably similar story.

""I'm always a bit skeptical before writing sessions. I don't have any high expectations usually,"" Brisebois told Insider. ""And when I went to meet Natasha, this burst of sunshine just burst through the door. I immediately felt, 'Oh my God, I just met somebody really important in my life.'""

They got to work on a few different songs, but none quite met their expectations. Then, Brisebois heard Bedingfield say the word ""unwritten"" and something clicked into place.

""Everything just started flowing,"" Brisebois said. ""Natasha and I are literally playing tennis together when we write songs. We go back and forth and it's like we can't get it out fast enough.""

Despite the song's title and central metaphor, its most memorable moment hinges on a different metaphor entirely: ""Feel the rain on your skin / No one else can feel it for you.""

It's the kind of accessible, tactile imagery that brilliant pop music is built on. But that line doesn't just feel good to scream-sing in a crowd of people. There's a deeply personal reason for its inclusion. Rather, there are two.

""When I wrote that, it was about how I used to walk around Manhattan completely broke,"" Brisebois said. ""I literally wouldn't be able to afford taking the subway home. So I would convince myself that if it was raining, it was OK because I was benefiting. I'd tell myself, 'I'm the lucky one. I'm walking in the rain.'""

""Natasha has a similar energy and feeling for that same lyric,"" she added. ""It just made sense. It's like we both needed to learn a lesson at the same time.""

Bedingfield's inspiration is quite literally an ocean away, and yet, both contain the create-your-own-destiny spark that makes ""Unwritten"" so irresistible.

""Mine is from my Mom. It started raining one day when we were in England, and she was like, 'Kids, quickly put on your swimsuits and we're going to dance in the rain,'"" Bedingfield explained. ""I was like, 'That is so embarrassing. Our neighbors are going to think we're ridiculous.' And she said, 'No, you have to trust me, you have to try this.'""

I don't just decide, 'I'm going to write a happy song.' I want to talk about real stuff, and then I want to let that stuff change me into a better person.

Beneath these lyrics lie a foolproof formula: Rodrigues' hip-hop-inspired beat, a twinkly guitar riff, and Bedingfield's rich vocals.

For the finishing touch, a choir swells to greet you in the bridge, as if all your loved ones have rushed to support you on your journey. In fact, that's exactly what happened.

A choir wasn't available, so Bedingfield enlisted a group of friends to record the layered harmonies. Her own sister delivers the high-pitched riffs, strengthening the song's bond to Bedingfield's family and childhood.

""One of the most intriguing things about songwriting is that you can make something that's very personal, and then the song takes on a life of its own,"" she said. ""It becomes personal to everyone else and that's the best result.""

""Right now, we're coming out of a pandemic, and I love that I'm seeing people online doing what the song was intended for -- releasing their inhibitions, trying new things, experimenting and having fun,"" she continued. ""I can see the song is still doing what I was hoping it would do.""

Bedingfield's music isn't having a ""resurgence"" or ""revival"" so much as it's becoming relevant to a new generation. For those of us who remember Bedingfield's noughties reign, her songs have already melted into the undercurrent of everyday life.

""Unwritten,"" of course, is particularly ubiquitous. It became the theme for MTV's ""The Hills"" in 2006, received a Grammy nomination in 2007, and undoubtedly remains one of the most-played songs at graduation ceremonies.

""I am known for these positive songs,"" Bedingfield mused. ""The reason they work is because they come from a place where I'm really questioning, and they have some depth to them.""

""I have my own kind of pessimistic views that I have to work through every day,"" she continued. ""I don't just decide, 'I'm going to write a happy song.' I want to talk about real stuff, and then I want to let that stuff change me into a better person.""

Brisebois echoed that theory, noting that Bedingfield's 2008 hit ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" was partially inspired by a family member of hers who lives with alcoholism. After returning from a rehab facility, Brisebois remembers they kept a sobriety coin in their pocket to feel more centered.

""If you just start preaching, that's when positive songs are cheesy. Audiences will call bulls -- easy,"" she said. ""If you do it the right way with the right person, the right singer -- I mean, I can't imagine anybody else singing 'Unwritten,' because it is Natasha.""

True to form, Bedingfield herself took far less credit, describing her songwriting as ""nursery rhymes"" and ""dream language"" with a modest shrug.

""Sometimes, your dreams come to you and they give you some truths, but they give it to you in a form that your subconscious can receive,"" she explained. ""That's why metaphorical songs work. Because they go past your critical brain and they go straight to your heart.""",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

What these articles do not recognize is that energy prices are increasing broadly. When considered properly, nuclear power is the only available technology that is adequate, affordable, reliable, safe, and environmentally clean. If the nation wants to limit CO emissions, then it must turn to nuclear power.

Though nuclear energy is expensive and lowering its real costs (as opposed to artificial discounts through subsidies and mandates) should by a primary goal of public policy-especially in light of its critical role in meeting CO targets-those who criticize nuclear energy based solely on costs do not fully appreciate the broader context of energy policy, energy inflation, and rising construction costs in general.

Rising Costs Are Not Unique to Nuclear

Cost problems are not specific to the nuclear industry. Energy and construction prices are escalating across the board. Much of the increase is a result of rising commodity prices for products like cement, steel, and copper.[3] The truth is that coal, wind, and solar projects are all becoming increasingly expensive. If those sources were inexpensive, few would even consider building new nuclear plants, yet nearly 20 companies are pursuing construction and operating licenses for up to 30 new reactors. Renewable energy sources would not need mandates and subsidies to survive if they were affordable.

Furthermore, assiging all of the costs of the first few nuclear plants to future plants is inaccurate. As more orders are placed, economies of scale will be achieved. Today, it is very expensive to produce nuclear-qualified components and materials because steep overhead costs are carried by only a few products. Additional production will allow these costs to be spread, thus lowering costs overall. Further savings should be achieved by applying lessons learned from initial construction projects. Because nuclear plants could have an operating life of 80 years, the benefit could be well worth the cost.

To argue that nuclear power is not viable based on cost alone while ignoring the many problems, including costs, that are associated with wind, solar, and efficiency measures is to present an inaccurate picture.

Wind and Solar Have Problems Too

Wind and solar power do have a role in America's energy mix, but those technologies alone are not ready or able to power the United States. Despite efforts to portray these sources as viable alternatives to nuclear power, they have their own problems. They are expensive, intermittent, and inappropriate for broad swaths of the United States. For example, wind turbines are virtually useless in the Southeast, where there is little wind. Even environmental activists are beginning to oppose wind projects because they kill birds, despoil landscapes, and ruin scenic views.

The costs of wind power have been increasing. The Department of Energy reports that the price of wind turbines has gone up 85 percent from 2000-2007, citing the declining value of the dollar and the increased input prices of steel and oil as the primary reasons.[4] In fact, the cost of planned wind generation in the Rocky Mountain region now exceeds $14.5 billion for about 8,000 megawatts of capacity. This may seem like a bargain until two important points are taken into consideration.

First, wind is intermittent, producing electricity only about a third of the time. This means that power plants are needed to provide electricity when the wind is not blowing. If one is going to rely on wind and the additional power-generating capacity that is needed when the wind is not blowing, those additional costs should be assigned to wind power as well.

Second, the life expectancy of windmills is projected to be 20 years.[5] Nuclear power plants produce power for up to 80 years. This must be taken into account when considering costs.

Solar energy projects are also running into trouble. Like wind, solar is intermittent: It produces electricity only when the sun is shining. The general economic problems of solar power were recently described in a study by Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business and director of the UC Energy Institute. He looked at the costs of 26,522 photovoltaic solar panel installations, equal to 103 megawatts of capacity, that have received state support from California and found that their cost ($86,000-$91,000) far outweighed their value ($19,000-$51,000).[6]

Other problems have arisen as well. For example, Solar, Inc., the world's largest solar company, recently told investors that its largest market, the European Union, may ban its solar panels because they contain toxic cadmium telluride.[7] To replace the cadmium model with a silicon-based model would quadruple the production costs.

The intermittent nature of wind and solar energy is important to the overall economics of energy and how these renewable sources relate to nuclear power. Given the low cost needed to operate a nuclear plant, lifetime costs are very low once the plant has been constructed.[8] It is therefore difficult to conclude that wind or solar power should be built at all.

This could explain why many opponents of nuclear power are committed to renewable portfolio standards.[9] These standards dictate that a certain percentage of energy-production capacity must come from wind and solar sources. This forces energy producers to invest in wind and solar even though such investment may not be economically rational.

Instead of mandating how energy is produced, the government needs only to set the regulatory framework and should allow the market to dictate how best to meet America's energy needs. If wind and solar are competitive, they will succeed. The same holds true for nuclear.

Efficiency Mandates Do Not Discount the Value of Nuclear Energy

Even critics of nuclear energy acknowledge that renewable sources alone will likely not meet America's growing energy demand. These critics assert that any shortfalls in supply will be met by increased efficiency, and they want mandatory energy reductions to assure that it happens. Such draconian measures are not needed and would not work without dire economic consequences. Energy efficiency standards have run into their own problems with higher costs and unintended consequences, such as lower productivity.

This is not to downplay the importance of efficiency. Energy resources are precious, and society benefits by their conservation. However, the value of efficiency mandates is questionable. People's interests are served by efficiency, and they will pursue it where it most benefits them. That is why consumers and producers, not government, should drive the push for efficiency.

Mandatory efficiency requirements often raise the price of consumer goods and force engineering in directions that technology is not ready to support. The result is often lower productivity and less efficient technological innovation. This not only affects everyday lives (toilets do not effectively flush, and washing machines do not effectively wash), but also can have broader technological effects.[10] For example, new CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)[11] standards will force automobile manufacturers to focus their research and development resources on meeting new miles-per-gallon mandates instead of on revolutionary transportation technologies.

The Market Should Decide

Government has no business making any decisions about nuclear power based on costs. Its role should be to provide adequate oversight and fulfill its legal obligations on nuclear waste. It is primarily private companies that produce America's power,[12] and consumers pay for it. Their interactions in the marketplace should determine the best way to meet America's energy needs.

The irony of mandates is that wind and solar may well have a place in meeting America's long-term energy needs. Massive wind farms that attempt to duplicate the model of high-output centralized power stations and individual photovoltaic solar installations on rooftops may not be the appropriate models. It may be that a decentralized model where households or neighborhoods have their own energy sources would work better for some of these technologies while more centralized models may work for others. But because the government attempts to funnel investment in one direction rather than allow the market to respond to peoples' needs, wind and solar many never get the opportunity to succeed.

A Sustainable Approach to Nuclear Power

In comparison to other emissions-free energy sources, nuclear power is both competitive and critical to the success of CO reductions. Even without those goals, nuclear power's many advantages make it an attractive energy source. The United States should allow nuclear power to reemerge as a viable and robust American industry.

A recent Heritage Foundation paper outlines ten market-oriented action items to reduce the cost of nuclear energy and prepare for a nuclear renaissance.[13] It recommends such policies as capping financial support at the level provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, liberalizing commercial nuclear trade, removing commodity tariffs, and resolving the impasse over Yucca Mountain.

Conclusion

Nuclear power must be expanded if CO caps are to work. Despite claims of high costs, nuclear power is competitive with renewable energy sources when all costs are factored in. The time has come to acknowledge the critical role that nuclear power will play in the United States.

That's right, the United States observed National Agriculture Week March 17-24, with the theme ""Agriculture: Growing a Climate for Tomorrow.""

Hopefully, you've seen some type of media content promoting or expressing appreciation to the men and women that work hard each and every day to provide food, fiber, and fuel we need. According to their website, ""The Agriculture Council of America is responsible for coordinating the event in efforts to help Americans understand how food and fiber products are produced; appreciate the role agriculture plays in providing safe, abundant, and affordable products; value essential roles of agriculture in maintaining a strong economy; and acknowledge and consider career opportunities in agriculture, food, and fiber industry.""

Farming has become more complex as scientists gain understanding between the interaction of soil, plants, and climate.

Industry has brought a wealth of new technologies, products, and information to the field that has further increased the number of important decisions that must be intricately evaluated as managers continue to pursue efficiency. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, ""Technological developments in agriculture have been influential in driving changes in the farm sector. Innovations in animal and crop genetics, chemicals, equipment, and farm organization have enabled continuing output growth without adding much to inputs. As a result, even as the amount of land and labor used in farming declined, total farm output nearly tripled between 1948 and 2017.""

In the spirit of celebrating National Agriculture Week, I want to highlight an exceptional program geared toward growing the next generation of future College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) students at NC State University who will be willing to take on the challenge of sustainably growing the food and fiber for a rapidly growing global population with less land, water, and natural resources.

Allow me to introduce the NC State Howling with CALS Camp. The Howling with CALS Camp is a four-day residential camp (June 9-15) for a small group of rising high school freshmen from rural and/or underrepresented communities and backgrounds in North Carolina to reside on NC State University's campus to learn more about opportunities within agriculture and life sciences.

From checking out our dairy cows and having a taste of howling cow ice cream to propagating weird and wonderful plants, this week promises a lot of fun discovery. They are seeking students who are interested in learning more about agriculture and life sciences disciplines, have a passion for making a difference, understanding the science behind these fields, and participating in hands-on learning - in particular those students who have not had a lot of exposure already to these disciplines.

This is a grant-funded opportunity.

Eligible and selected campers do not need to pay a registration or camper fee (travel costs to and from NC State's campus not included). The goal is to expose young people to many of the academic, career, and professional opportunities within the College, and to support them even further in thinking through preparing to be a successful and well-balanced high school student ready to apply to college in the future.

Campers will be led by trained NC State undergraduate and graduate student Camp Counselors, alongside CALS staff and faculty, through a number of different activities during their stay on campus.

Belgium defender Thomas Meunier reckons Manchester City have signed the next Neymar after snapping up lightning-fast winger Jeremy Doku.

Meunier, the 32-year-old right-back who now plays for Turkish club Trabzonspor, spent three years alongside Neymar at Paris St Germain - and admits the Brazilian forward was a nightmare to play against even in training.

Now he is backing Doku to reach the same heights despite an inconsistent start to his City career following his £55million arrival from Rennes last summer.

Meunier, who will be tasked with keeping Harry Kane and Co quiet when England face Belgium at Wembley on Wednesday night, said: ""Doku has so much talent - and so much self-confidence too.

""He has not reached the level of Neymar yet. Neymar is the only player who could make me wince on the pitch. I don't get a headache playing against Doku. Well, not yet! But I really don't rule it out that he will reach that level one day.""

Doku burst onto the scene at the Etihad after being recruited to replace the creativity of Riyad Mahrez. Despite an individualistic style that doesn't fit in with Pep Guardiola 's usual requirements, his form was so electric that Jack Grealish was forced to accept a fight to win his place in the team.

Doku has added a new dimension to City's play

His form has dipped in recent weeks, but he gives the Premier League champions the kind of unpredictable threat defenders hate. Doku and PSV Eindhoven's brilliant 20-year-old flier Johan Bakayoko have given Belgium a new devastating threat from the flanks following Eden Hazard's retirement.

Kevin De Bruyne is 32 and will miss the game against England through injury. Jan Vertonghen is 36 and Romelu Lukaku 30. But Meunier believes there could be another Golden Generation about to emerge for the Red Devils.

He said: ""I was always calm and quiet as a young player. This kid Doku and Bakayoko don't know the word stress. They look as if they have been at the top level for years. That is not a bad thing. In training, we played a game and Bakayoko was telling me where to run. That's class.

Meunier (left) played with Neymar at PSG

""People don't know us because there are fewer big names playing with us these days, but there is a lot of quality. I am not saying we will win the European Championship. But I do dare say with certainty that we won't go out in the group stages. The future looks bright.

""I am not Romelu Lukaku or Kevin De Bruyne. They are still so important to the team while I have to prove myself every day at a good level.""

Belgium's Italy-born coach Domenico Tedesco will also be without Thibaut Courtois. Real Madrid 's former Chelsea keeper is recovering after surgery to repair a damaged knee ligament.

But he stormed out of the squad and threatened to retire from international football last summer after being overlooked as stand-in captain when De Bruyne was ruled out of qualifiers against Austria and Estonia.

Meunier insisted: ""I wasn't in the dressing room at the time. It's something between Thibaut and the coach, but I don't believe any door was closed.""

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued an avalanche warning along the White Mountain's Presidential Range until 7 a.m. Sunday.

""Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Natural and human-triggered avalanches large enough to bury people are very likely,"" the center said. ""Some avalanches will be large enough to snap trees or destroy a house and may run far into areas previously considered safe.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Flooding impacted subway service, shutting down a section of the Staten Island Railway in both directions Saturday. Flooding also closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens and delayed the opening of Coney Island's Luna Park, home to the famous Cyclone and Thunderbolt rollercoasters.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

A Philippine civilian boat, escorted by two navy ships and two coast guard vessels, was on a monthly supply run to a small number of Filipino marines stationed on the ""Sierra Madre"" - a warship intentionally run aground on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 in order to reinforce The Philippines' territorial claims in the area.

According to a statement from the Philippine coast guard, one of its ships was ""impeded"" and ""encircled"" by a Chinese coast guard vessel and two ships from the Chinese maritime militia.

Philippine authorities said one of its vessels had been damaged by a water canon during the ""dangerous maneuvers"" undertaken by the Chinese, who it said had showed a ""disregard"" for the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS).

The statement accused he Chinese ships of ""irresponsible and provocative behavior.""

China, which claims most of the South China Sea as its territorial waters, has regularly deployed vessels to monitor and disrupt efforts to resupply the ""Sierra Madre"" and described Saturday's operation as ""control measures.""

In a similar incident in March, Manila claimed that four Filipino sailors had been injured and two boats damaged.

No injuries have been reported this time.

China has even constructed artificial islands in the region and fortified them to underline its claims.

They simpy want different things in life. You don't say. ... I mean them young bucks they ain't built like we used to be built. ...

""They say she like it two three times a day 365. He probably got one and done. He ain't built like that. ... He ain't on them power pellets.""

Larsa Pippen and Jordan reportedly split earlier this year, unfollowing each other on social media and removed their pictures together.

Despite those developments, the couple was spotted together in Miami around Valentine's Day, adding another chapter to their saga.

However, they have allegedly parted ways for good this time, as reported by Entertainment Tonight.

Looking back at what Larsa Pippen said about her and Marcus Jordan's sex life

During a Real Housewives of Miami reunion, Larsa Pippen explained that she and Scottie Pippen had sex four times a day. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen earlier this year, she dropped more details on her sex life.

This time, however, given that she was dating Marcus Jordan, she dished on their sexual activities. With Marcus Jordan standing off to the side, she explained:

""I also have sex probably five times a night with the love of my life.""

""I'm addicted to the playoffs. I've been there multiple times...once you get a taste of that, it's kind of addicting,"" said JD Martinez in an interview with SNY Mets.

This is hardly surprising given the player's previous playoff success. He has appeared in three World Series, two with the Houston Astros and one with the Boston Red Sox. The atmosphere of October baseball is something he thrives in.

In 2023 the Mets had a disappointing season. Adding a player like, Martinez gives a new hope to them. He, Pete Alonso, and other young players like Francisco Alvarez and Brett Baty would make the team more powerful.

The Russian military has launched a powerful wave of air and missile strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight, officials in Kiev have claimed. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has yet to comment on the assertions.

Reports on the ground described it as the most powerful attack for many months. One Russian missile strike targeted the Dnieper Hydro Power Plant (HPP) in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporozhye, according to Ukrhydroenergo. The company stated that the facility had been hit and that a fire was raging at the site.

In a post on Facebook on Friday, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko alleged that Russia's goal was ""not only to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale failure of the country's energy system.""

""Unfortunately, there are impacts and damage to power generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems in various regions,"" he wrote, noting that one of the power lines linked to Russia's Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant had been severed.

Meanwhile, massive blackouts have been reported elsewhere in the country, including Kharkov, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Vinnitsa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Nikolaev regions. According to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Moscow used more than 60 drones and almost 90 missiles of different types in the barrage.

Kharkov Mayor Igor Terekhov said that there had been 15 explosions in the city, reporting issues with water supplies, while traffic lights and electric transport have been completely disabled.

The head of Odessa Region, Oleg Kiper, said Russian strikes had left around 53,000 people without electricity, with work underway to repair the damage.

Commenting on the latest strikes, Russian MP Mikhail Sheremet stated they were in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilians in Belgorod and other border areas, which left dozens of civilians dead.

Moscow began targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the autumn of 2022 in retaliation for the bombing of the strategic Crimean Bridge in October of the same year. While Kiev initially denied responsibility, it later claimed that the attack was intended to undermine Russian logistics.

The Brazilian musician has revealed that the album will be out on April 26 via her new label Republic Records, alongside Universal Music Latin Entertainment.

'Double Team' includes features from Puerto Rican artist Brray and Spanish singer Bad Gyal. Check it out here:

Speaking about the record, Anitta has said: ""'Funk Generation' is an album where I celebrate my roots. It's where I express the power of [Rio de Janeiro's] funk in every track its unique, danceable, and sensual beats. It's a rhythm born in the favelas, where I grew up, and it exudes resistance and art in every community.""

""I'm proud to work on a project about a genre that has been unfairly stigmatized in Brazil but is slowly gaining recognition worldwide. In the album, I bring in important collaborations that helped me tell this story. I've been involved in every step of the production and visual direction, and I've achieved the result I've been aiming for.""

The album follows on from last August's EP release of 'Funk Generation: A Favela Love Story'.

In April last year, Anitta parted ways with Warner Music Group, after claims that she would have ""auctioned off her organs"" to end her contract with them. She had been signed with the company for over a decade.

""If there was a fine to pay, I would have already auctioned off my organs, no matter how expensive it was to get out. But unfortunately, there isn't,"" she had written online, warning followers about the importance of legal documents.

Argentines' efforts to preserve their savings amid the ongoing decline of their national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), has resulted in the nation recently hitting its highest demand for Bitcoin in 20 months, according to a recent report.

On March 20, Bloomberg reported data sourced from cryptocurrency exchange Lemon Cash revealing nearly 35,000 customers in Argentina purchased Bitcoin in the week ending March 10, which is double the weekly average compared to 2023.

Bitcoin purchases in Argentina Jan 2023 - March 2024. Source: Bloomberg

A major factor for the increase in demand is the ongoing decline of the nation's currency.

Over the past twelve months, the ARS value against the US dollar has plummeted, dropping from 0.0049 USD per ARS in March 2023 to 0.0012 USD at the time of publication.

However, it was noted that Lemon wasn't the only platform seeing a surge in demand. Other major exchanges in Argentina, such as Ripio and Belo, reported similar trends.

According to the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, Manuel Beaudroi, stablecoin purchases in Argentina declined from 70% to 60% as Bitcoin's recent price surge attracted more interest.

""The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.""

He also claimed that Belo has seen volume in Bitcoin and Ether increase ""tenfold so far in 2024 compared to the same period last year.""

However, a recent report suggests that interest in stablecoins might still exist, as Argentines are possibly choosing not to use the well-known exchanges within the country for purchasing them.

On Feb. 12 Cointelegraph reported that Argentines are using black market exchanges, known locally as ""crypto caves,"" to buy USD stablecoins in an effort to escape strict currency controls and the rising inflation of the ARS.

Meanwhile, the use of digital currency for specific transactions is slowly gaining traction within the country.

In December 2023, Diana Mondino, the minister of foreign affairs, international trade and worship, claimed that a decree aimed at economic reform and deregulation would allow the use of Bitcoin and other cryptos in the country under certain conditions.

Some tribes don't believe there's been enough research into the impacts on the environment.

At least five tribes along the West Coast have announced their opposition to proposed offshore wind development. Five areas off the California coast were auctioned off in late 2022 to build floating wind turbines. And the federal government is considering sales off the Southern Oregon coast.

Derek Bowman, a council member with the Bear River Band of the Rohnerville Rancheria south of Eureka, California, said the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, hasn't involved the tribes enough in the process.

""We have a huge amount of traditional ecological knowledge that could assist in a lot of assessments that they're doing,"" Bowman said. ""And we're not really included in it. It feels like we're just a checkbox that they have to check in order to say, 'Hey, we talked to the tribes, we're good to go.' And we're not alright with that.""

The Northern Chumash Tribe, which people live in Southern California, expressed concerns about the proposed sale of two offshore wind areas near Morro Bay in 2022 before they were auctioned off. Their opposition wasn't about offshore wind in general, but because of the sites overlapping with a nearby proposed National Marine Sanctuary.

This year, a number of other tribes came out in formal opposition to the projects. The first was the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in mid-February.

""BOEM's press release states that it has 'engaged' with the Tribe, but that engagement has amounted to listening to the Tribe's concerns and ignoring them and providing promises that they may be dealt with at some later stage of the process,"" said Tribal Council Chair Brad Kneaper in a statement.

More tribes quickly joined in opposition, including the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation, the Bear River Band of the Rohnerville Rancheria and California's largest tribe, the Yurok. All three announced their opposition in early March.

Bowman said that historically, logging and gold mining industries took natural resources and gave little back to tribal communities.

""It's just hard for us to accept that what's best for everyone actually means it's good for us too,"" he said. ""Because we always suffer when the government comes in to say, 'This is what's best for everybody and we need to do it in your area to help people in another area.' It never works out for us.""

Beyond a lack of engagement, Bowman says there hasn't been enough research into the environmental effects, both on the ocean and on land. Those include possible effects of turbines on fishing and marine animal activities, as well as transmission lines on land that could harm endangered species in the region.

""More importantly, when it comes to overland transmission lines, it's the potential for fires. They cause fires all over California,"" Bowman said. ""And now running right through our ancestral territory, there are going to be these very large transmission lines overland.""

In a statement, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it agrees that tribes must have a seat at the table.

""We have taken coordinated actions to incorporate Indigenous Knowledge and Tribal input into our decision making process and we are working to help Tribes expand capacity to engage in environmental reviews, work with industry, and develop partnerships,"" said BOEM in a statement.

Israel is considering Hamas's demand for a commitment not to assassinate the organization's senior officials if they are exiled from the Gaza Strip, Kan reported Friday.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated in November that he had told the Mossad ""to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.""

Israel would agree to this in exchange for an agreement that would include the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the release of all the hostages, according to the Kan report.

Hamas is simultaneously demanding the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza.

The proposal is backed by the United States as part of the next phase of a hostage deal in which Hamas would release 40 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire.

An Israeli senior official told Kan that an offer is being considered, ""including a commitment not to harm the exiled senior officials.""

Deals on the table

During the hostage negotiations, Hamas officials said they would only release the remaining hostages in Gaza as part of a ceasefire. Netanyahu has said that he will not accept any deal that would leave Hamas in control of Gaza.

One recent framework for a proposed deal was a phased release of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with the goal of a ceasefire, a senior Western diplomat and a regional diplomat told The New York Times.

Israeli officials have suggested they might consider a permanent ceasefire if Hamas's Gaza leadership leaves the Strip and goes into exile, the two diplomats told the NYT.

Hamas officials have rejected leaving the Strip, according to the report. ""Hamas and its leaders are on their land in Gaza,"" Husam Badran, a senior Hamas official, said in a text message. ""We won't leave.""

By the day, by the hour.

""I've gotten more than 4,000 of them from everywhere, even people in Canada,"" said Del Solar, a native of Chile. ""I'm like, 'I don't know who you are, but thanks!'""

Such is life for Mr. 57, a sobriquet never mentioned at golf's highest level. Life has changed immensely since Feb. 8 when Del Solar had a morning tee time in the first round of the Astara Golf Championship in Bogota, Colombia, on the Korn Ferry Tour.

Del Solar birdied six of his first eight holes on the par-70, 6,254-yard course before he drove the par-4 ninth hole for an eagle to make the turn in an eye-popping 27. He then birdied No. 10, eagled the par-5 12 and added birdies at the 14 and 15 holes before finishing with three pars for a back-nine 30.

It added up to a 13-under 57 -- much to his surprise.

""I honestly didn't know where I was at,"" Del Solar said. ""I didn't know I was 13-(under), maybe 12- or 14-. I was just trying to make birdies. I didn't know I had set a world record until all the reporters started coming up to me afterward.""

He knows now. It took more than three hours to complete his post-round interviews. Everybody wanted to know more about the 30-year-old who had eclipsed the 58s Jim Furyk shot at the Travelers Championship and Stephan Jaeger fired at the KFT's Ellie Mae Classic, both in 2016.

""I finally said, 'I'm done,' "" Del Solar said. ""I knew I hadn't done anything yet. I still wanted to win the tournament, and we had 54 holes to go. I hadn't even made the cut.""

Del Solar didn't go on to win the tournament -- he finished fifth after following history with rounds of 69-75-63. It's no surprise Del Solar struggled in the middle two rounds when he couldn't go out to eat in Bogota without fans pointing at him or asking for photos.

Not that any golfer will complain about a 57.

""It definitely was a boost of confidence, knowing I had accomplished something nobody else had done,"" he said. ""It assured me my game was moving in the right direction, even though I already knew that. And it gives me more name recognition. Everybody knows me in Chile; not so much here.""

Here's what to know about Del Solar's past: He moved to the U.S. to attend the IMG Academy in Bradenton before accepting a scholarship to play at Florida State. He turned pro in 2017, moved to South Florida and started playing on the PGA Tour Latinoamerica, where he won four times, before moving to the KFT last year.

Del Solar believes a big step in his career occurred when he joined Dye Preserve in Jupiter. This allowed him to play on the difficult Pete Dye design that exposed his flaws.

""People were asking me after the 57 if I had shot a lower score on my home course,"" Del Solar said. ""I told them no way. The Dye Preserve is harder than most tournament courses I play.""

When fellow Chilean Joaquin Niemann turned pro in 2018 and moved to Jupiter, Del Solar persuaded him to join Dye Preserve. The same with countryman Mito Pereira, who would have won the 2022 PGA if not for a double bogey on the 72 hole.

Niemann has recently been one of the hottest golfers in the world, becoming the first LIV Golf member to receive an exemption into the Masters. Pereira followed Niemann to LIV.

""The Dye is the best environment for us, having all of our friends there with us,"" Del Solar said. ""That's what makes us better, constantly working together. We always grew up practicing and competing and pushing each other. It's like family.""

Del Solar and his wife, Alexandra, are expecting their first child, a girl, in June. It's already been a transformative year for the young couple. Del Solar hopes to someday join Niemann and Pereira on golf's biggest tours. Del Solar is 12 on the Korn Ferry Tour standings (the top 30 get promoted to the PGA Tour) and 233 in the world rankings.

Following a lack of response from HYBE, netizens also sent a protest truck to its headquarters, demanding several things but majorly addressing the removal of Scooter Braun, HYBE America's CEO. In a previous interview, he openly admitted that he was pro-Israel, and netizens also pointed out that his circle has been with other Zionists in the industry.

People also pointed out that several of his online interactions and posts have pointed towards his pro-Israel stance, affecting the net disregard for his stance as the CEO of HYBE America. Given that there have also been issues regarding Scooter Braun's poor artist management skills, fans also raised concerns regarding the same unfolding with HYBE artists.

Many fans stated they were unhappy with Scooter Braun being associated with HYBE artists and demanded his removal from the leading entertainment agency. Therefore, on March 23, a protest led by the Palestinian Youth Movement, who've been actively creating agency on the issue all around the US, unfolded in front of HYBE America's headquarters in California.

People appeared at the venue with banners that advocated for him to be removed as HYBE America's CEO as they marched around the area shouting slogans. Several others also brought their vehicles with them, made loud noises, noises and honked as they continued the protest in front of the headquarters.

Given that the issue has been transformed into a physical showcase of fans' displeasure and disinterest in Scooter Braun's association with HYBE and their artists, they hope the problem is resolved immediately.",sportskeeda.com,news,Sportskeeda,Aishwarya Sai,-0.1450980392156863,448921615,1,https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/03/de70d-17112223761393-1920.jpg,

Typically, it's viewed primarily in military-technical terms. The reasons why an attack may be contemplated are usually not taken into account.

This idea emerged in the middle of the last century, when the USSR had achieved military-strategic parity with the US and the Cold War between them had entered a ""mature"" phase of limited confrontation and some predictability. The solution to the problem of strategic stability was then seen in the constant maintenance of contacts between the political leadership of the two superpowers. Which led to arms control and transparency in arranging their respective arsenals.

However, the first quarter of the 21st century is ending in conditions very different from the relative international political stability of the 1970s. The US-centric world order established after the end of the Cold War is being seriously challenged and its foundations are visibly shaken. The global hegemony of Washington and the position of the collective West as a whole is weakening, while the economic, military, scientific and technological power and political importance of non-Western countries -first and foremost China, but also India- are growing. This is leading to a deterioration in relations between the US and other centers of power.

The two largest nuclear powers, Russia and the US, are in a state of semi-direct armed conflict. This confrontation is officially regarded in Russia as an existential threat. This situation has become possible as a result of the failure of strategic deterrence (in its geopolitical dimension) in an area where Russia's vital interests are present. It should be noted that the main cause of the conflict is Washington's conscious disregard -for three decades now- of Moscow's clearly and explicitly expressed security interests.

Moreover, in the Ukrainian conflict, the US military and political leadership has not only articulated, but has publicly expressed, the mission of using its proxy to inflict a strategic military defeat on Russia, despite its nuclear status.

This is a complex task in which the collective efforts of the West in the economic, political, military and military-technical, intelligence, information and other fields are integrated with the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces in direct combat with the Russian army. In other words, the US is trying to defeat Russia not only without using nuclear weapons, but even without formally engaging in hostilities.

In this context, the declaration of the five nuclear powers of January 3, 2022, that ""nuclear war should not be waged"" and that ""there can be no winners,"" seems like a relic of the past. A proxy war between the nuclear powers is already underway; moreover, in the course of this conflict, more and more restrictions are being removed, both in terms of the weapon systems used and the participation of Western troops, as well as the geographical limits of the theater of war. It is possible to pretend that a certain 'strategic stability' is being maintained, but only if, like the US, a player sets the task of inflicting a strategic defeat on the enemy at the hands of its client state and expects that the enemy will not dare to use nuclear weapons.

Thus, the concept of strategic stability in its original form - the creation and maintenance of military-technical conditions to prevent a sudden massive nuclear strike - only partially retains its meaning under current conditions.

Strengthening nuclear deterrence could be the solution to the real task of restoring strategic stability, which has been seriously disrupted by the ongoing and escalating conflict. To begin with, it is worth rethinking the concept of deterrence and, in the process, changing its name. For example, instead of a passive form, we should talk about an active one. The adversary should not remain in a state of comfort, believing that the war he is waging with the help of another country will not affect him in any way. In other words, it is necessary to put fear back into the minds and hearts of the enemy's leaders. The beneficial sort of fear, it's worth stressing.

It must also be recognized that the limits of purely verbal intervention have been exhausted at this stage of the Ukrainian conflict. Channels of communication all the way to the top must remain open around the clock, but the most important messages at this stage must be sent through concrete actions: doctrinal changes; military exercises to test them; underwater and aerial patrols along the coasts of the likely enemy; warnings about preparations for nuclear tests and the tests themselves; the imposition of no-fly zones over part of the Black Sea, and so on. The point of these actions is not only to demonstrate determination and readiness to use available capabilities to protect Russia's vital interests, but -most importantly- to bring the enemy to a halt and encourage it to engage in serious dialogue.

The escalation ladder does not end here. Military technical steps can be followed by real actions, warnings of which have already been given: for example, attacks on air bases and supply centers on the territory of NATO countries, and so on. There is no need to go further. We simply need to understand, and help the enemy to understand, that strategic stability in the real, not narrow, technical sense of the word is not compatible with armed conflict between nuclear powers, even if (for the time being) it is being waged indirectly.

It is unlikely that the enemy will accept this state of affairs easily and immediately. At the very least, they will need to realize that this is our position and draw the appropriate conclusions. It is time for us to start revising the conceptual apparatus we use in matters of security strategy. We talk about international security, strategic stability, deterrence, arms control, nuclear non-proliferation and so on. These concepts emerged in the course of the development of Western - mainly American - political thought and found immediate practical application in US foreign policy. They are based on existing realities but adapted to American foreign policy objectives. We have tried to adapt them to our needs, but with mixed success.

It is time to move on and develop our own concepts that reflect Russia's position in the world as well as its needs.",rt.com,news,RT,RT,-0.1450980392156863,448921560,1,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.03/article/65ff382685f540149b45d928.jpg,

Cheap fakes from online marketplaces pose a threat, supply-chain experts say - Today Headline","Americans from Maine to Texas are set for a rare treat on April 8, 2024, when a total solar eclipse will be visible across much of the U.S.

In ancient times, eclipse-viewers thought they were watching the sun be eaten by wolves, a dragon or a demon.

Of course, we now know that the sun isn't really eaten during an eclipse. Instead, it does what it always does: rain ultraviolet rays on everything in its path. That's why you should never look at a solar eclipse without protective eyewear.

But not just any eyewear will do. To make sure that you enjoy the total solar eclipse safely, the American Astronomical Society has specifically warned against buying eclipse glasses at the lowest price from online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay.

What gives? Why not save a buck on something you'll use possibly just once for a few minutes?

It turns out there's a very good reason: Deceptive counterfeit products have infiltrated retail supply chains. And some of them can pose a threat to your health.

As experts in supply-chain management, we know that counterfeit products have become a growing problem in recent years.

While counterfeit products can be found at brick-and-mortar shops, they're an especially big problem at online marketplaces. Amazon removed more than 6 million counterfeit items from its supply chain in 2022 alone.

There are several reasons for this. First, our recent research shows that consumers often consider the reputation of an online retailer while judging a product's quality. Unscrupulous third-party sellers can take advantage of this fact by selling their wares through a reputable online marketplace.

Another complication arises from the fulfillment services offered by some marketplaces, such as Amazon, where third-party sellers directly send their merchandise to the online retailer's warehouse for shipping and handling. These sorts of fulfillment services offer a little-known benefit to retailers: If a product is running out of stock, they can ""borrow"" from a third-party seller's inventory.

Unfortunately, this also means that a consumer who agrees to buy from one retailer may actually receive merchandise -- perhaps counterfeit -- from a third-party seller. While there aren't statistics showing how frequently this happens, there's evidence it's a significant problem.

Thankfully, customers are becoming more aware of counterfeit products and have increasingly pushed online retailers to separate inventories of authorized sellers of merchandise from those that aren't. For instance, Amazon maintains a list of ""gated"" brands, such as Asics and Under Armour, that require authorization before they can be sold.

But these protections don't apply across the board. In fact, some counterfeit-prone brands, such as Birkenstock, refuse to sell their products through some online retailers entirely. That leaves an opening for counterfeiters, who tend to offer the lowest prices.

That's why the American Astronomical Society recommends eclipse-watchers avoid buying protective glasses from the lowest-price sellers on online marketplaces. And we completely agree. After all, counterfeit sunglasses can be returned, but damage to your eyes is permanent. In 2017, one California man wearing counterfeit eclipse glasses was left with retina damage.

If you're in the market for eclipse glasses, it's not hard to get a safe pair. First, buying directly from one of the American Astronomical Society's approved list of brands and manufacturers is the most reliable way. Unfortunately, many of them only sell cheaper, disposable solar eclipse viewers in bulk.

If you need a single pair, your next best option is to purchase one from a major brick-and-mortar chain retailer in person. Many organizations are also handing out free viewers. If you take one, you should make sure it was made by a manufacturer on the American Astronomical Society's list.

If you must buy from an online marketplace, look for evidence of manufacturer authorization. For instance, American Paper Optics -- an American Astronomical Society-approved brand -- maintains a list of Amazon sellers approved for reselling their viewers.

What if you've already bought something from a no-name seller on Amazon? Let's say you bought a pair of sunglasses, or eclipse glasses, with UV protection. It's hard to verify UV protection properties. Sure, there are standards and certifications such as UV400 and ISO 12312-2, but as you have probably guessed, even those can be faked. For instance, you can easily buy entire rolls of UV400 stickers online.

Thankfully, most local opticians can test your sunglasses' UV protection properties in seconds. In other words, when in doubt, verify.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

The theme of this year's United Nations World Water Day is 'Water for Peace', emphasizing the vital significance of water in ensuring the stability and prosperity of our world.

A series of events took place to celebrate this special day from the Peace walk around FCT to the special press conference with all the relevant partners, international NGOs, Federal Ministries representatives, and private corporations.

Speaking at the commissioning of the solar-powered borehole, the Minister, Prof. Joseph Terlumun Utsev said; ""We are extremely happy to celebrate yet another World Water Day with everybody and in particular with the donation of this borehole which is most significant of the celebration. The Gudu Community is grateful for this"".

""All year round we sensitize and celebrate the day to bring attention to one of the leading environmental issues, the scarcity of water."" Water is life, and we cannot even imagine our life without water. Water means a lot to us more than just quenching our thirst, but it plays the role of a vital component of human development; This day provides us an opportunity to think about this issue and how we can make a difference.""

The Minister additionally said, ""Around 2 billion people around the world do not have access to clean and safe drinking water, and approximately 3.6 billion people - 46% of the world's population - lack adequate sanitation services, according to a new United Nations World Water Development Report released. This is a major contributor to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea""

Prof. Utsev added, ""In Nigeria, approximately 60 million people lack access to safe water sources, leading to numerous health challenges and impeding socio-economic development."" Hence we need to keep appealing to corporate organizations such as what LG Electronics has done today to provide good drinking water for vulnerable communities like Gudu and all across the country so we can gradually reduce the numbers""

Also at the event, the Managing Director, LG Electronics, Mr. Hyoung Sub Ji thanked the Ministry for the opportunity to collaborate with them to contribute to the community. He said the relevance of LG's slogan cannot be over-emphasized which is ""Life's Good"" With good drinking water people can live and have a good life. This is what has prompted us to do this"" he said

Mr. Ji advised, ""This year, we at LG are proud to align with the theme of Water for Peace. We urge other corporate organizations to collaborate with relevant institutions in combating the scarcity of clean water, which tragically leads to the premature deaths of vulnerable children and adults nationwide. Together, through partnership and collective action, we can make a significant impact on ensuring access to safe and clean water for all.

We've already featured Best Visuals winner Flight from Podunk Station and Best Adaptation winner Mickey Party, and Best Remix winner The Burden Of Creation, and today we're taking a look at the winner of Best Deep Cut: Solar Storm 1928 by David Harris.

As you probably know, David has been a repeat winner in this jam ever since his first entry, and Solar Storm 1928 continues his track record of submitting games that blow our mind with their creativity and uniqueness. It's a tabletop game that forges a connection between two very different works from 1928: Buckminster Fuller's design for the Dymaxion House (a futuristic home design that sought to ""maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input"") and a huge collection of sketches from astronomers at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, documenting solar storm activity. Some of Fuller's sketches just scream out to be used as game board, so that's where things begin: with each player designing their own Dymaxion House by placing the walls and furniture on the floorplan, already outfitted with some futuristic fixtures.

Next, the true game begins, as the players subject each others' houses to acute damage caused by solar activity across a series of rounds, while struggling to keep their own houses together by making repairs, rearranging doors and furniture, installing reflectors, and utilizing special tools like the bathroom fogger and vacuum pump. This is already enough for an extremely cool game about Fuller's design -- you could have players rolling dice or using some other simple source of randomness to determine the amount of damage. But this is where Solar Storm 1928 goes a step further, and reaches for a true deep-cut public domain source. The amount of damage that players must contend with is instead generated by having each turn represent a day of the year (players can begin the game on any date they choose), then pulling the actual documented solar storm activity for that day from the collection of Mt. Wilson Observatory sketches. A simple analytic process laid out in the rules translates each sketch into a number of damaged tiles for the round.

As play proceeds, the player grids fill up with damage and alterations, until one house fails entirely at which point all the houses get scores based on how they held up.

As with all the designer's past winning games, Solar Storm 1928 isn't just mechanically interesting, it's also a thoughtful and playful reflection on the works it draws from. This time, the game also includes a full separate booklet of Designer Notes, discussing and explaining the origin and nature of this reflection: inspired by visits to old observatories and a fascination with their handwritten records, leading to the discovery of the sunspot sketches which in turn sparked thoughts of architecture and engineering. The game then emerged as a way to explore ""the tension between the idea of the universe being difficult, and humans trying to make up for it."" For succeeding wonderfully in this reflection while offering fun and engaging gameplay, all grown from the seed of some technical drawings in an observatory's archives, Solar Storm 1928 is this year's Best Deep Cut.",techdirt.com,news,Techdirt,Leigh Beadon,0.3411764705882352,448920804,1,https://www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-14.png?w=640,

Consulting firm Accenture cut its projected revenue growth for 2024. And Deloitte has launched a massive reorganization to cut costs.

Times are tough for the consulting business.

Professional services firm Accenture has cut its revenue forecast for 2024, according to its quarterly report. The firm previously said it was expecting revenues to grow between 2% to 5% this year but is now expecting a growth rate more like 1% to 3%.

Accenture's chief executive Julie Sweet told analysts in a call that clients continue to cut back.

""We get visibility into our clients' budgets in January. So as we turned the page [into the new year] what we saw was a further tightening of spending [by] our clients and that affects our services,"" she said, according to the Financial Times.

Accenture said in its quarterly report that consulting revenue for the second fiscal quarter, which ended on February 29, fell about 3% compared to 2023.

Major consulting firms across the board are facing waning demand from clients. That trend has hit especially hard because some firms swelled their ranks in recent years as companies flocked to them for advice on navigating the pandemic. Now, amid tough macroeconomic conditions, there's not enough work for those new hires. Firms now offer new hires stipends to start their jobs months later than planned. Accenture, for example, offered new hires out of college up to $25,000 to push their start dates back.

Some consulting firms are surviving the slowdown by reorganizing. Earlier this week, the FT reported that Deloitte has launched ""the biggest overhaul"" of its operations in a decade.

As part of the reorganization, Deloitte's main business units will be divided into four units -- down from five -- which will help reduce costs across the firm, the FT said. Deloitte's global chief executive Joe Ucuzoglu told the firm's partners by email that the reorganization will tamp down on the firm's ""complexity"" and ""free up"" more partners for client work instead of internally managing staff.

""We recently completed a thoughtful process to modernize and simplify Deloitte's storefront and go-to-market strategy. We are confident this will further enhance the exceptional quality and value we deliver to our clients and communities, as well as the vibrant career paths we provide our people,"" a spokesperson for Deloitte told Business Insider in a statement.

Despite all the doom and gloom, one bright spot for consulting firms is the promise of AI. The need to understand the new technology and how to implement it appears to be revving up demand for new projects at several firms.

Accenture reported that new bookings in generative AI brought in over $600 million in the most recent quarter and $1.1 billion through the first half of the fiscal year.

I don't even know where to start.

I don't know what's going on, all l can say with certainty is that something is going on.

Most people are so disconnected now they don't pay attention to anything but TikTok, Taylor Swift and Trump, but they really should, because everything on earth and in the sky are pointing to the coming of the Messiah.

Luke 21:25-28 says ""There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.""

And, in Joel 2:31, ""The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.""

But whose Lord is coming? Will it be the arrival of Satan or Jesus, or will it be when we finally rise to Christ consciousness? Aka, when Sat Yuga starts.

I have spoken about the lunar eclipse on March 25, and my wife's warning that something is going to happen on that day, and then BAM! we have an attack on civilians in Moscow executed by the CIA/Mossad and ISIS (Israel Secret Intelligence Service), which, by te way, Donald Trump has said was founded by Barack Dronebomber and run by Killary. Will there be a retaliation in a few days? Is this the trigger they've been waiting for to start the final chapter of the Three World Wars, which will be fought ""to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion...""?

Or, will they wait 2 weeks until the April 8th solar eclipse (on the JeruSALEM path through Texas, the supplier of the Masonic/Zionist/Satanist red heifer sacrifice) to unleash the Third Temple Project when they destroy the Al Aqsa Mosque, reveal the Anti-Christ to everyone as the saviour and take their rightful place in the world domination agenda?

Who knows? Interestingly, also on April 8th, the Devil's Comet Cometh. I shit you not. And, comets were historically considered bad omens of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants.

So you have the devil comet that predicts the deaths of kings. And, although we shouldn't usually take these thing literally, King Charles III, daughter-in-law Princess Kate, and former sister-in-law Sarah Ferguson (ex wife of the Pedo Prince) all have cancer. Which could be because of the jab, or just a promo for the miracle cure of the soon-to-be-released Pfizer ""cancer vaccine"".

We shall see. Or maybe we won't and the end of days will come sooner than you think.

The five-day event spreads across the Decatur County Fairgrounds and features hundreds of tractors, combines, and other pieces of farm equipment, from the antique to the present. The event also features a massive flea market and draws vendors and antique machinery enthusiasts from Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and beyond.

Attendance at the annual event has grown to more than 16,000 people.

The event's history

In 1988, Dale Wilson, a local farmer and machine enthusiast, wanted to start something like the antique machine shows he enjoyed attending in neighboring counties.

Feeling such an event might be of interest to other local farmers, Wilson talked it over with friends Mark Klosterkemper, Bob Anderson, Paul Vanderbur, Mark Waechter, Tom Striecker, Don Herbert and Fred Lee, and they agreed it could be a success.

After clearing it with the Decatur County Fair Board, the group jumped full force into pulling the first show together and was able to hold its first show the following August.

With everyone's hard work and effort, the first show was a success and drew more than 3,500 people.

""That first year we made enough money, so we decided to do it again,"" said current Power of the Past President Clark Martin.

In 1992, the tractor show, now at 300 attendants expanded from the midway to the field behind the fairgrounds.

Year by year, the festival grew -- and so did the flea market!

Someone needed to take charge of the growing flea market vendor list, so in 2009 Kim Carpenter was brought into the fold.

Carpenter takes care of booking the flea market vendors and managing the fairgrounds' campsites during the event. In 2021, Carpenter booked 18 food vendors and food trucks to feed the crowds.

""She gets things done, so we leave her alone and let her do her own thing. I just don't think we'd be good at it,"" organizer Tom Cherry said.

A giant circular sawblade, painted by a friend of the festival, is placed outside the Decatur County Fairgrounds in August to herald the annual show.

On the blade is the festival logo (a tree growing out of an antique tractor), which was drawn by original organizer Bob Anderson on a beverage napkin.

A typical festival schedule

Every year's show is different, but a basic order of events is followed.

Each morning begins at 8:30 a.m. with the raising of the United States flag and the singing of the National Anthem.

Attending vendors usually set up on Wednesday to prepare for the customers they'll meet during the show and run from 8:30 to 8 or 9 p.m. in the evenings.

Tractor enthusiasts register for the distance pull event which usually begins at 6 p.m. on Thursdays.

Fridays feature horse and wagon rides, a tractor cruise-in, BINGO, and a music jam in the Farm and Home Building. At 6 p.m., the Memorial Stock Tractor distance pull gets underway at the Grandstand, and the adult pedal-pull takes place in the Headquarter's Building.

Also on Friday, the flea market vendors are open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., with toy show vendors operating until 8 p.m.

Saturday morning begins with a wagon train at 9 a.m., and more BINGO and tractor games in the Tractor Field.

After the noon hour whistle comes the old-time Fiddle Contest in the Farm and Home Building at 1 p.m. and the Dan Wilson Memorial Parade around the midway.

Later are the kid's pedal pull contest, kid's games, a Catholic Mass in the Farm and Home Building, and a miniature horse pull.

The evening consists of a student jam in the Farm and Home Building, a professional heavyweight horse pull at the Grandstands, and a ""Spark Show"" in the steam engine area.

The final day of the festival (Sunday) usually begins with a Vesper service in the Farm and Home Building and an auction at 9 a.m. Cherry organizes the auction, which is usually scheduled for the last day of the festival. In 2023, it grossed more than $250,000!

The future

Both Cherry and Martin are animated when they talk about the festival. They have been with Power of the Past (both have served as president) for most of their lives and remain excited about the annual show.

Cherry stepped out while he raised his children, but his devotion to the festival is unflagging. And with such a long history of success and growth, both men are willing to continue.

But there is a problem.

""We're in the process of trying to hand this off. If we don't, it's gonna die,"" Cherry said.

The unofficial theme for the future of the Power of the Past is ""passing it on."" Younger board members are eventually taking over the massive task of putting on the annual event, but the fear is that the love of farming and the old ways aren't as exciting to younger generations. So, the two men do their best to make it appealing to younger people.

""I don't think those original guys ever dreamed it would as big as it is now,"" Martin said.

Powers of the Past officers are Clark Martin, Joe Mobley, Tom Cherry and Lana Martin.

Directors are Jason Barhorst, Bryan Cathey, Casey Clark, Cory Crafton, Clay Hunger, Chaela Martin, Frank Narwold, Owen Ortman and Blaine Schroeder.

Show dates for the 2024 show are Aug. 14 to 18.

The Commissioner representing Ondo State on the Board of Niger/Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Otito Atikase, while giving anupdate on the electrification project said it would be ready for commissioning next month.

However, a report on Saturday stated that some of the transformers already installed at Igbokoda have been vandalized.

A statement by media aide of the commissioner, Rotimi Oyeneyin, said ""The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) expresses grave concern over the recent vandalism of electric transformers in Igbokoda, as part of the ongoing electrification project aimed at enhancing the lives of residents in the region.

""This wanton act of destruction not only undermines the progress of the electrification project, but also poses a significant setback to the socio-economic development of the community.

""The transformers, recently installed by the NDDC, were meant to bring much-needed electricity to Igbokoda and its environs, thereby improving the living standards and economic prospects of the residents.

""However, the senseless act of vandalism threatens to deprive the community of this vital infrastructure, which was implemented at a significant cost to the commission.""

The NDDC Commissioner called on the Nigeria Police Force, the Amotekun security outfit, the Department of State Services (DSS), and other relevant security agencies to intensify efforts in protecting critical infrastructure facilities across the region.

""We urge these agencies to collaborate closely with local communities and stakeholders to identify and apprehend the perpetrators of this heinous crime.

""It is imperative for the Ilaje communities to understand the grave implications of such dastardly act. While Okitipupa town and its surroundings would continue to revel in consistent and uninterrupted electricity, Igbokoda town would remain entrenched in perpetual darkness.

""Without adequate protection of infrastructure, the goal of bringing light to these communities will remain elusive, hindering progress and development.

With chocolate makers around the world reliant on west Africa for cocoa, there is significant concern about the impact on the prices of chocolate and the livelihood of farmers. Cocoa researcher Michael Odijie explains the reasons for the shortage.

Three factors are at play: environmental, economic cycle related and human.

One environmental factor is the impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which has caused drier weather in west Africa. It has contributed to problems on farms, such as the swollen shoot virus disease. As a result, Ghana has lost harvests from nearly 500,000 hectares of land in recent years.

The economic cycle of cocoa production refers to the inherent patterns of expansion and contraction in cocoa farming. For example, as cocoa trees age, they become susceptible to diseases, requiring high maintenance costs. Historically, farmers have tended to abandon old farms and start anew in fresh forests. Unfortunately, finding new forests is now increasingly difficult. Perhaps the most severe issue of all is the lack of fair compensation for sustainable cocoa production

The human factor includes challenges such as illegal mining, which has overtaken numerous farms in Ghana. Sometimes, farmers lease their land to illegal miners in exchange for payment. These mining activities degrade the quality of the land, making it unsuitable for cocoa cultivation.

The global market for chocolate and chocolate products is on the rise. It is projected to grow faster than 4% annually over the next few years. This growing demand for cocoa underscores the urgency in addressing the intertwined issues that relate to the industry's sustainability.

In February 2024, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod), regulator of the country's cocoa sector, secured a World Bank loan of US$200 million to rehabilitate plantations affected by the cocoa swollen shoot virus. The board will take over the disease-ridden farms, remove and replace the afflicted cocoa trees, and nurture the new plantings to the fruiting stage before returning them to the farmers.

This practice of Cocobod taking out loans to assist farmers is a longstanding one in Ghana. For instance, in 2018, Cocobod used part of a $600 million loan from the African Development Bank to rehabilitate aging plantations and those hit by diseases. And at the start of the current harvest season in October, the producer price was raised: farmers are paid more, a move made inevitable by the surge in global prices. Also, Ghana Cocobod has established a task force to shield cocoa farms from the harmful impacts of mining. It has cooperated with police to stem the smuggling of cocoa to neighboring countries, particularly those that offer a stronger currency.

In Côte d'Ivoire, relatively little action has been taken. It appears the government is still assessing the situation. But there have been measures to curb smuggling of cocoa, prompted by the fact that the shortage is driving up prices in neighboring countries. Côte d'Ivoire does benefit from numerous sustainability programs initiated by multinational corporations. The current shortage has accelerated these initiatives. Regrettably, some of the programs do not disclose their data, making it difficult for academics to access and analyze their information.

African governments have yet to address significant structural issues in their interventions.

At the farm level, although the rise in prices may initially appear beneficial to farmers, the reality is not straightforward. A decrease in output leads to fewer harvests on average, which means that, overall, farmers are not earning more. This issue is compounded by recent economic challenges in west Africa, such as high inflation and currency devaluation, particularly in Ghana. These factors have resulted in farmers becoming poorer.

Another impact of the output decline is a reduction in local processing. Major African processing facilities in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have either ceased operations or reduced their processing capacity because they cannot afford to purchase beans. This likely means that chocolate prices worldwide will surge. This, in turn, adversely affects the local production units that have been emerging in recent years.

However, the bargaining power of west African cocoa-producing countries seems to have increased. Now is an opportune moment for these nations to unite and negotiate more favorable terms for their cocoa farmers.

It's inevitable because continuing to cultivate cocoa under current conditions is unsustainable. I don't perceive this negatively; I hope it occurs sooner rather than later. In fact, it is already underway with the rise of cocoa butter equivalents, cocoa extenders and artificial flavors (synthetic or nature-identical flavors that mimic the taste of chocolate without the need for cocoa).

The German company Planet A Foods is a leader in this area. It produces cocoa-free chocolate, using technology to transform ingredients such as oats and sunflower seeds into substitutes for cocoa mass and butter.

Overall, this is beneficial for everyone. The demand for cocoa has resulted in mass deforestation and significant carbon emissions, issues that are likely to worsen due to climate change. Moreover, the push for cultivation has led to various forms of labor abuses. Exploring cocoa alternatives is certainly part of the solution.",phys.org,news,Phys.org,,-0.04313725490196074,448920455,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2019/cocoa.jpg,

But such a claim would be forgetting China, where a good billion citizens also regularly vote to elect their National Legislature.

The difference is that India practises a competitive multi-party system while China practises a single party system. Readers are advised to carefully appreciate the differences between these two systems, one being Liberal Democracy (India) and, the other being Social Democracy (China).

In China's national elections, voters still do have a choice between individual candidates, all members of the Communist Party except for a few rare independent groups. Voters can still choose according to candidates' individual performance profiles, their specific policy sets and, their general reputations.

More importantly, the candidates' livelihood or professional survival is not solely hinged on political success. Thus, there is no desperate and unscrupulous scramble to win, riding on the backs of supporter resources and accompanying governance undertakings and financial influence.

Neither is there the prospect of drastic policy changes arising from the policy commitments of radically differing political outlooks of rival, competing, parties. Much of this seeming governance 'efficacy' of the one-party system is undermined by strictures on individual citizen's liberties, especially the freedom of information and of political choice afforded under the Liberal political system, despite the vagaries and manipulations of big business and Big Tech.

In the case of India's competitive politics, sharp inter-party policy differentials have evolved - although not as much as the gulf between America's Democratic and Republican parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been pushed in the direction of a Hindu and Hindi centric national policy corpus. The Congress and its core allies have had to remain within a traditional secularist narrative in order to fulfil its 'inclusive' promise.

The BJP's greed for even greater political dominance is pushing it even further rightward, into an uncivil exclusivist narrative that, having already mobilised social violence deeper and deeper in the nation's social fabric, is already reaping the violent whirlwind.

One thing common in the political systems of India and China is that, in both their electoral systems, all citizens have equal sovereignty and franchise. This is in stark contrast to the political disposition of that small State, Israel, currently busy ethnically 'cleansing' an even smaller territory, Gaza.

Palestinian subjects

Israel, though, is flaunted by its Western backers as the ""sole"" democracy in West Asia even as it proceeds to blast its conquered Palestinian subjects and their homes to smithereens. The Zionist State's own citizens are constitutionally separated into the privileged 'Jew' and less privileged non-Jewish categories.

Worse, Israeli military expansionism has been so relentless and oppressive that those occupied territories, so far spared of bombardment, are nightmarish enclaves of fenced-in, socially-deprived pockets of territory.

According to the March 16 formal announcement by the Indian Elections Commission, India's 969 million registered voters will begin voting to elect the new Lok Sabha National Legislature on April 19. The voting will go on in seven phases across all 28 States and Union Territories over the next six weeks until June 4 when the results will be officially declared. There will be 15 million election workers at a million polling stations.

Some 2,660 political parties will contest the elections conducted at various levels. Following the declaration of results for all 543 Seats, the political party or coalition of parties with a majority of seats that enables it to rule, will become the new Government of the world's largest capitalist democracy.

According to reports from Delhi, current Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of 370 Seats for his Hindu/Hindi nationalist BJP. Apparently, the confident Premier wants the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, which his party leads, to win 400-plus Seats in the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Indian Federal Legislature. In 2019, the BJP won 303 Seats.

The ruling NDA will be challenged by a broad alliance of Opposition parties, with the acronym 'INDIA' for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, led by India's own 'Grand Old Party' (GOP), the venerable, ailing, Indian National Congress. For some analysts, the Congress' illness is terminal.

When the BJP was emerging as a new political party in the 1980s, it was the Congress that had the all-India appeal while the BJP was yet concentrated in the Hindi belt. Not today.

The NDA has not only matched and even bettered the Congress in the Hindi belt, but it has also shown complete agility in negotiating winning deals with regional parties in the non-Hindi zones: the southern, Dravidian linguistic region of the Deccan Peninsula as well as the, barely 'Indian', north-eastern frontier states. Another victory, even if narrow - as some analysts predict - would make Modi, 73, only the second Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, India's Independence hero and first Prime Minister, to win a third straight term.

In four states - Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim - the Lok Sabha as well as State Legislative Assembly elections will be held simultaneously, with their results to be also declared on June 4. Andhra is one of the richest, most developed, States while Odisha is one of the poorest. By-elections will also be held for 26 State Assembly constituencies across the country.

Utilising their advantages as the Government in power, the BJP-NDA has been building up its election campaigning since last year with numerous project launches, project completions and tamashas. Somewhat belatedly, the Congress alliance has also launched a similar campaign. Just last week, the charismatic Rahul Gandhi presided over a massive state-wide Congress Party march and rally in Mumbai's Shivaji Park with a crowd estimated at well over 100,000.

Ideological

While the very coming together of some 24 political parties under the INDIA umbrella enables a comprehensive, countrywide, challenge to the incumbent BJP-NDA combine, the diverse nature of the Opposition alliance - both ideological and in terms of caste/class/regional differentials - is also its main vulnerability.

This diversity provides a powerful vote catchment. But it is the sharing of electoral power that will strain its unity both during seat allocations as well as in Government formation (if successful).

This veritable festival of exercise of universal franchise that we see in our giant neighbour has never been enjoyed by the indigenous people of Palestine. The Palestinians are the only nation in the world not to have this fundamental power of voting to elect and appoint their own, fully independent, Government.

Next month's election in India is being keenly watched by the whole world. The BJP's domestic politics of ultra-nationalism has meant an abrasive form of international relations in its neighbourhood. At the same time, the somewhat simplistic reliance on market economics alone - except for piecemeal public handouts for votes - has meant a disproportionate reliance on a courting of Western investment rather than the traditionally slow mixture of indigenous productivity alongside joint ventures.

Hence the constant readiness to lean Westwards. This has resulted in a greater Indian dependence on geostrategic links with the West. This conformity with the US framework of the 'Indo-Pacific' is in sharp contrast to the traditional 'Non-Aligned' posture that had enabled Delhi previously to be far more self-reliant militarily and in terms of economic resources.

Delhi's current Hindu-centric posture has distanced itself from Islam-linked geopolitical power and reduced its ability to have a strategic comfort zone in its own neighbourhood and also in relation to the oil wealth of adjoining West Asia. Instead, Delhi must face up to China's inexorable superpower rise not on its own strengths based on multilateralism - but only with one set of leverage, namely, the seemingly knee-jerk hostility of Washington towards Beijing.

In the past, Non-Alignment gave India a multi-dimensional geopolitical capacity to be less confrontational with China, and to continue its military refinements with Russian as well as exploit Western technology.

That close link with Russia, which is a vital geostrategic ally of China, would serve to smoothen away the abrasive rivalry that Delhi must now deal with on the other side of the Himalayas.

Instead, Delhi now finds itself just a little too dependent on what is the outgoing superpower bloc led by Washington; 'outgoing' economically as well as politically, given Washington's persistence in supporting an immensely globally unpopular and illegitimate aggressive militarism by Israel.

Much of the world is morally disturbed by Western proxy Israel's brutality and at the same time directly affected by the current and potential instability in the entire West Asian region. This region crucially bolsters world energy stability and also is a vital source of Third World migrant livelihood.

If the Congress returns to power, however, both South Asia as well as the world - except Washington - is likely to appreciate a cooling down of India's current somewhat blustering diplomacy. The Global South, in particular, would love to not solely depend on a rapacious West and credit-hungry China, even if Beijing's 'Belt & Road' entrepreneurship is indeed enormously beneficial to poor countries.

Certainly, the current demonising of Islam within India does not serve to calm nerves and sensibilities in much of the SAARC region which is home to no less than three Islamic majority states, two of them rising powers themselves.

Whether BJP or Congress, India's sheer size guarantees its standing in the world. What is important is that that brawn is matched by the brains inherent in the glorious legacy of the Maurya, Gupta and Moghul civilisational pulses. The very complex but always smooth exercise of India's election operation is a wonderful example of that civic strength.",sundayobserver.lk,news,Sunday Observer,,0.3254901960784313,448920224,1,https://www.sundayobserver.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9-2-2.jpg,

Arvind Kejriwal, New Delhi's highest elected official and prominent anti-corruption activist, was arrested by a federal agency Thursday evening.

India Directorate of Execution, which is controlled by Narendra Modi government, accused Kejriwal's party and ministers of accepting a billion rupees (£9.5 million) in bribes over the city's alcohol policy.

A court ordered him to be held in detention until March 28.

Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - also known as the Common People's Party - denied the ""fabricated"" allegations and promised he would remain Delhi's chief minister while he fights the case in front of the courts.

The AAP is part of an alliance of opposition parties that have banded together to become the main challenger to Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

His rivals say the prime minister is using law enforcement to orchestrate a crackdown and harass opponents in the run-up to national elections.

Kejriwal's wife Sunita posted a message on behalf of her husband on the AAP X account.

Kejriwal reportedly said he was not surprised by his detention as he had ""struggled a lot"" and warned of ""several forces inside and outside India that are weakening the country"".

Cries of ""Kejriwal is the death of Modi"" and ""Dictatorship will not be tolerated"", demonstrators on Saturday accused the Indian leader of running the country under a state of emergency.

This comes after hundreds of AAP supporters and some senior party leaders clashed with police on Friday, who took a number of them away in buses.

The BJP says law enforcement acts independently of the government, with a spokesperson accusing Kejriwal's party of playing the ""victim card"".

But critics point out that investigations against rivals who later defected to Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata party have been dropped.

Kejriwal's arrest represents a new setback for the opposition alliance, with the Congress party on Thursday accusing the government of freezing its bank accounts in a tax dispute aimed at paralyzing it.

Kejriwal launched the AAP in 2012 and campaigned on a promise to rid India's political system of corruption - with a broom as his party logo.

In 2023, the Enforcement Directorate arrested Kejriwal's deputy Manish Sisodia and AAP politician Sanjay Singh in connection with the liquor corruption case. Both remain in prison.

BlackRock IBIT holds the largest amount of Bitcoin, surpassing MicroStrategy which has held the position for the longest possible time. Precisely, the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF holds a total of 243,125 units of BTC. Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy has approximately 214,246 Bitcoin following its last purchase and this gives the business intelligence and software firm 1% of the total BTC supply.

These two companies are followed by another spot Bitcoin ETF issuer Fidelity Investments with 136,034 Bitcoin. ARK 21Shares ARKB and Bitwise BITB were next with Bitcoin holdings of 40,298 and 30,292 respectively. Popular Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital was also on the chart, holding approximately 16,930 units of Bitcoin.

Other companies with significant Bitcoin holdings were Tesla, Coinbase, and even Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. which had the lowest volume of BTC at 8,027 units.

With these top Wall Street firms increasing their BTC holdings, a supply shock may just be underway. For context, regular exchanges and trading platforms may be left with little or no Bitcoin for their regular customers. This supply pressure has already been brewing on some exchanges for some time and may eventually take over the broader industry.

All of these developments are coming at a time when Bitcoin is trying to find its footing with frequent price fluctuations. Bitcoin price was at $65,416.36 at press time after hitting around $73,000 about a week ago. Many experts and analysts believe that the cryptocurrency is still within a healthy retracement.

So far, the price of the coin has tumbled by over 4.5% suggesting that BTC is grappling to make a sustainable recovery. With the coming Bitcoin halving event, the supply shock being stirred by massive accumulations might be amplified, contributing to the ultimate recovery in the price of the coin.

Put to bat first by Sunrisers Hyderabad, the Kolkata Knight Riders were off to a fine start as Phil Salt smacked Marco Jansen for three successives in the second over. However, on the last ball of the over, Sunil Narine, who was sent to open the batting, was run out for a duck. KKR was 23/1 in two overs.

This, however, opened the floodgates for some quick wickets, as pacer T Natrajan dismissed Venkatesh Iyer for seven after being caught by Marco Jansen, while the Indian also removed skipper Shreyas Iyer for a duck after he was caught by Pat Cummins. KKR was 32/3 in 3.5 overs.

Nitish Rana and Salt took KKR to a 50-run mark in 7.1 overs. Mayank Markande, however, dismissed Nitish for just nine as his reverse sweep attempt was caught by Rahul Tripathi at deep backward point. KKR had slipped to 51/4 in 7.3 overs.

Ramandeep Singh joined Salt at the crease. The right-hander attacked Cummins, smashing him for a four and six and dispatched Markande for a six. Halfway through the innings, KKR was 77/4, with Salt (36) and Ramandeep (20) unbeaten.

Ramandeep continued his onslaught, hitting Jansen for a four and six. KKR reached the 100-run mark in 11.4 overs. The duo brought up their 50-run stand in just 27 balls.

Salt-Ramandeep partnership was over, with skipper Cummins dismissing the latter and Markande taking a fine diving catch. Ramandeep was back in the hut for 35 in 17 balls, with afour and four sixes. KKR was 105/5 in 12.1 overs.

Salt reached his third IPL fifty in 38 balls, with three fours and three sixes. His entertaining knock ended at 40 balls for 54 runs, consisting of three fours and three sixes. Markande took his second wicket, while Jansen took a catch at deep midwicket. KKR was 119/6 in 13.5 overs.

Andre Russell and Rinku Singh were the fresh pair on the crease. Russell was at his aggressive best, smashing Markande for two sixes and then smoking Bhuvneshwar Kumar for two fours and a six in the 17th over.

KKR reached the 150-run mark in 16.3 overs and Russell-Rinku also recorded their 50-run stand in 22 balls.

Rinku-Russell continued to smoke KKR during death overs, with the duo taking 15 runs from Natrajan's 18th over.

Russell was in no mood to spare Bhuvneshwar, as in the 19th over, the pacer was smoked for two fours and two sixes, 26 runs in total. Russell reached his fifty in 20 balls, with two sixes and six sixes.

KKR reached the 200-run mark in 19 overs.

However, the 81-run partnership in 32 balls came to an end with Rinku being caught by Aiden Markram at long-on for 23 in 15 balls, with three fours. KKR was 200/7 in 19.1 overs.

KKR ended their innings at 208/7, with Russell unbeaten at 64 in 25 balls, with three fours and seven sixes and Mitchell Starc unbeaten at 6.

""On the day of Shri Ram's Pran Pratishtha, Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodiji promised Muft Bijli to 1 cr houses. In 60 days ModiKiGuarantee hits the ground. We have installed a 3 KW solar-rooftop in Shri Sailen Kakati's home, Assam's first PMSuryaGhar beneficiary,"" Sarma said in a post on 'X'.

The Chief Minister further shared that the beneficiary's house was located at Janakpur Road at Guwahati's Kahilipara area.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that over 1 crore households have already registered for the solar rooftop scheme PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana.

""Outstanding news! In about a month since it was launched, over 1 crore households have already registered themselves for the PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. Registrations have been pouring in from all parts of the nation,"" PM Modi posted on X.

The Prime Minister further said that Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have seen over 5 lakh regulations.

The rooftop solar programme was announced in the interim Budget tabled on February 1. With an investment of over Rs 75,000 crores, the project aims to light up 1 crore households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month.

To popularise this scheme at the grassroots, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayats shall be incentivised to promote rooftop solar systems in their jurisdictions.

According to the government, the benefits expected from this solarisation are savings up to Rs 15,000-18,000 crore annually for households from free solar electricity and selling the surplus to the distribution companies; charging of electric vehicles; entrepreneurship opportunities for a large number of vendors for supply and installation; and employment opportunities for the youth with technical skills in manufacturing, installation and maintenance.

Cheap fakes from online marketplaces pose a threat, supply-chain experts say","Americans from Maine to Texas are set for a rare treat on April 8, 2024, when a total solar eclipse will be visible across much of the U.S.

In ancient times, eclipse-viewers thought they were watching the sun be eaten by wolves, a dragon or a demon.

Of course, we now know that the sun isn't really eaten during an eclipse. Instead, it does what it always does: rain ultraviolet rays on everything in its path. That's why you should never look at a solar eclipse without protective eyewear.

But not just any eyewear will do. To make sure that you enjoy the total solar eclipse safely, the American Astronomical Society has specifically warned against buying eclipse glasses at the lowest price from online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay.

What gives? Why not save a buck on something you'll use possibly just once for a few minutes?

It turns out there's a very good reason: Deceptive counterfeit products have infiltrated retail supply chains. And some of them can pose a threat to your health.

As experts in supply-chain management, we know that counterfeit products have become a growing problem in recent years.

While counterfeit products can be found at brick-and-mortar shops, they're an especially big problem at online marketplaces. Amazon removed more than 6 million counterfeit items from its supply chain in 2022 alone.

There are several reasons for this. First, our recent research shows that consumers often consider the reputation of an online retailer while judging a product's quality. Unscrupulous third-party sellers can take advantage of this fact by selling their wares through a reputable online marketplace.

Another complication arises from the fulfillment services offered by some marketplaces, such as Amazon, where third-party sellers directly send their merchandise to the online retailer's warehouse for shipping and handling. These sorts of fulfillment services offer a little-known benefit to retailers: If a product is running out of stock, they can ""borrow"" from a third-party seller's inventory.

Unfortunately, this also means that a consumer who agrees to buy from one retailer may actually receive merchandise -- perhaps counterfeit -- from a third-party seller. While there aren't statistics showing how frequently this happens, there's evidence it's a significant problem.

Thankfully, customers are becoming more aware of counterfeit products and have increasingly pushed online retailers to separate inventories of authorized sellers of merchandise from those that aren't. For instance, Amazon maintains a list of ""gated"" brands, such as Asics and Under Armour, that require authorization before they can be sold.

But these protections don't apply across the board. In fact, some counterfeit-prone brands, such as Birkenstock, refuse to sell their products through some online retailers entirely. That leaves an opening for counterfeiters, who tend to offer the lowest prices.

That's why the American Astronomical Society recommends eclipse-watchers avoid buying protective glasses from the lowest-price sellers on online marketplaces. And we completely agree. After all, counterfeit sunglasses can be returned, but damage to your eyes is permanent. In 2017, one California man wearing counterfeit eclipse glasses was left with retina damage.

If you're in the market for eclipse glasses, it's not hard to get a safe pair. First, buying directly from one of the American Astronomical Society's approved list of brands and manufacturers is the most reliable way. Unfortunately, many of them only sell cheaper, disposable solar eclipse viewers in bulk.

If you need a single pair, your next best option is to purchase one from a major brick-and-mortar chain retailer in person. Many organizations are also handing out free viewers. If you take one, you should make sure it was made by a manufacturer on the American Astronomical Society's list.

If you must buy from an online marketplace, look for evidence of manufacturer authorization. For instance, American Paper Optics -- an American Astronomical Society-approved brand -- maintains a list of Amazon sellers approved for reselling their viewers.

What if you've already bought something from a no-name seller on Amazon? Let's say you bought a pair of sunglasses, or eclipse glasses, with UV protection. It's hard to verify UV protection properties. Sure, there are standards and certifications such as UV400 and ISO 12312-2, but as you have probably guessed, even those can be faked. For instance, you can easily buy entire rolls of UV400 stickers online.

Thankfully, most local opticians can test your sunglasses' UV protection properties in seconds. In other words, when in doubt, verify.",medicalxpress.com,news,Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News,,0.1294117647058823,448919500,12,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/solar-eclipse-3.jpg,eng-9413446

""Red Flag Laws"" are another arrow in the quiver of anti-Second Amendment activists and politicians, and while they are of questionable constitutionality, that hasn't stopped various states and localities from passing these laws. On Saturday, the Justice Department announced the formation of a ""National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center"" to help train local officials to enforce these laws.

""The launch of the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center will provide our partners across the country with valuable resources to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""The establishment of the Center is the latest example of the Justice Department's work to use every tool provided by the landmark Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to protect communities from gun violence.""

The Vice President has weighed in, presumably, on this same effort:

President Biden and VP Harris have not ""invested"" one red cent; they are instead spending taxpayers' money, not their own, as the VP implies in this statement.

Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) has also weighed in:

And, once again: There is no such thing as ""gun violence,"" any more than there is ""knife violence"" or ""fist violence,"" so the very premise here is based on a fallacy.

Be that as it may, red flag laws are questionable on a constitutional basis, as they seek to deprive people of their property with minimal or no due process, and almost certainly violate of the Second Amendment. But there's another problem with initiatives like this.

Obama Judge Rules Illegal Aliens Have the Right to Own Guns

In January, the Department of Justice ballyhooed another federal effort to sidestep the Second Amendment, this one having to do with ""enhanced"" background checks. Here's the key point:

Since implementing BSCA's enhanced background checks in October 2022, the FBI NICS Section has conducted enhanced background checks on more than 200,000 transactions. Those checks have kept more than 1,900 firearms out of the hands of dangerous and prohibited persons, and over a quarter of those denials -- 527 as of the first week of January -- were based solely on information received through the additional BSCA-enabled outreach. Without the enhanced outreach required by BSCA, these 527 U21 transactions would likely have proceeded because the disqualifying information was otherwise unavailable to NICS.

While keeping guns out of the hands of bad guys seems like a good idea on the surface, let's take a closer look at what the DOJ is really saying here.

Out of 200,000 background checks, the DOJ claims that the enhanced checks kept 1,900 firearms ""out of the hands of dangerous and prohibited persons."" Further, they claim that 527 had happened in the month before releasing this report. Consider that it is a federal felony for a prohibited person to attempt to purchase a firearm, and consider further that it is also a crime to falsify information on Form 4473 that is part of the mandated process for purchase. Since there is no evidence that any of these 1,900 people were prosecuted, then we can only draw two conclusions: 1) The laws aren't being enforced, or 2) the people, or at least a portion of them, were wrongly denied their natural rights under the Second Amendment.

That will doubtless be the case with this new Department of Justice effort. Like so many activist projects by the federal government, most especially under Merrick Garland's Justice Department, this is, as the Bard said, ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",redstate.com,news,Redstate,Ward Clark,0.0117647058823529,448919495,1,https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/346/50069c92-3d02-4ef3-adc8-3767a381cc06.jpg,eng-9420443

James Maddison has been branded a ""complete player"" by Premier League legend Cesc Fabregas, but the Tottenham star remains a fringe member of Gareth Southgate's England squad.

Maddison has enjoyed an impressive season so far since making the move to Spurs following Leicester's relegation to the Championship. However, the 27-year-old has earned just five caps since being named in his first England squad by Southgate back in 2018.

And Maddison has had to settle for a spot on the bench as England take on Brazil at Wembley in one of few games they have ahead of Euro 2024, leaving him with little opportunity to stake his claim for inclusion in the squad.

Despite Maddison's lack of England caps, he has earned plenty of praise from two-time Premier League winner Fabregas. ""Straight away you could feel he""s got the confidence,"" Fabregas said on the BBC's Planet Premier League podcast.

""He's got the personality to demand the ball, to make things happen and to create situations. He's good at dribbling, he is good at assisting and he can score goals. So he's a really complete player in my opinion.

""He has a good understanding with Son (Heung-min) and the strikers and for me he's a fantastic player to have. And as a coach I'm sure that you need to adapt to the strengths of your players and the better quality they have, the easier it is.

""And definitely he is one of them you would always want in your team."" However, Fabregas did express some reservations about the adventurous approach Maddison is currently playing under Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.

James Maddison has earned just five England caps, despite receiving his first call-up back in 2018

""It is brave and you need to trust your players a lot,"" the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder added. ""But for me you are not under control because you are basically reacting, you are not proactive.

""You are reacting to their movements, you are reacting to whatever the striker wants to do. If he comes deep, I come with him. If he goes attacking the space, I go with him. I'm not a big fan of this because as I said, you are not in control of the situation.

""He's dictating the play for you. I like to dictate my play and I like to take the defence. If the ball is covered, then I can press. If the ball is uncovered then my defenders need to drop a little bit.""

The Armed Forces of the Philippines said that BRP Cabra managed to manoeuvre and reach Unaizah May 4 to provide assistance to the Philippine supply boat, which had sustained ""significant damage.""According to the Philippine military, the confrontation lasted for nearly an hour and took place as it sought to resupply a small garrison of sailors on board the sunken Sierra Madre off Second Thomas Shoal.

The Philippines military has shared a video showing a white ship marked Chinese Coast Guard crossing the bow of a grey vessel, which it identified as the Philippine supply boat Unaizah May 4.

In a post on X, Armed Forces of the Philippines stated, ""The BRP Cabra managed to maneuver and reach Unaizah May 4 to provide assistance to the Philippine supply boat, which had sustained significant damage,"" Al Jazeera reported.

In a statement, the Philippines military said, ""The UM4 supply boat sustained heavy damages at around 08:52 (00:52 GMT) due to the continued blasting of water cannons from the CCG vessels.""Meanwhile, Chinese Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu claimed that the Philippine convoy ""forcibly intruded into the area despite repeated warnings issued by China. It further said that China conducted ""control, obstruction and eviction in accordance with law,"" Al Jazeera reported.

It is the latest incident between China and the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea. China continues to claim almost the entire South China Sea, despite an international court finding in 2016 that the nine-dash line on which it bases its claim was without merit. Meanwhile, Philippines claims areas of the sea around its coasts like Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia. Taiwan has also claimed areas of the sea.

The Philippines has expanded its military ties with the US. The United States has no claims to the strategic waters. However, it has sent Navy ships on transit missions through the waterway in what it says ""freedom of navigation"" operations. China has criticised the US action in the waters.

Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Philippines. During the visit, he stated that the US commitment to the Philippines was ""ironclad,"" Al Jazeera reported.

Following the visit, the Chinese coastguard attempted to drive away Philippine scientists who landed on two cays near Scarborough Shoal, a disputed South China Sea outcrop that China seized from the Philippines after a standoff in 2012.

He spoke during a town hall meeting at the Old Government House, Enugu.

He said, ""Electricity is a major infrastructural requirement for private sector to thrive, adding that the state would leverage on the removal of the power generation, transmission and distribution from exclusive list to concurrent list to provide steady power supply to the citizens.""

The governor said the State Electricity Regulatory Commission would soon be in place as part of measures to actualize the goal.

""There shall be no monopoly as people will be allowed to buy and sell electricity.""

Mbah also promised continuous payment of wage awards to state workers until the committee on new minimum wage concludes its work.

He said his government would prioritise workers' welfare, adding that he would create values that would help workers to thrive.

""Until new minimum wage is concluded, we will continue to pay wage award,"" he assured.

The governor, who added that his administration inherited arrears of pension and gratuity of retired civil servants, explained that he did not waste time in clearing them.

""Today we are working seriously to clear that of primary school teachers and Local Government workers.""

On education, Mbah said his administration identified it as the strongest weapon to fight poverty, saying ""this is why we are building SMART Schools across 260 wards which will be operational by September, 2025''.

""Our children will now be using tablets to study and teachers smart boards to teach while the student would learn about artificial intelligence, robotics and others that will make them technological inclined,"" he added.

The governor said that the government was building type two Primary Health Centres across the 260 wards to reduce infant and maternal mortality in the state.

Mbah said he had already awarded 30 contracts for the health centers and about to award 100 more.

He pledged to design a programme to ensure students palliative and also sustain the state's Scholarship Board.

Speaking further, Mbah said his administration had not increased the tax rate. Rather, according to him, the government has expanded the tax net with commitment to enforcing the already existing tax laws in the state.

On the challenges of water supply in the state, the governor warned tanker drivers to desist from sabotaging government's efforts on the water project, vowing that anyone caught will be made to face the full wrath of the law.

He promised that transparency, accountability and accessibility would remain at the core of his administration's philosophy, to make the state a preferred destination for living, tourism and investment.

The governor said that he had tackled security challenges and made tremendous improvements to make the state safe and secure.

He pointed out that his administration had installed CCTV cameras at strategic areas in Enugu metropolis, and had commenced the construction of military barracks in some flash point areas to checkmate criminality.

He stressed that his administration had declared a state of emergency on infrastructure, particularly water, by upgrading the daily production from 40 million liters to 120 million liters, even as reticulation to homes and neighborhoods were ongoing.

For some viewers, the sun will be totally eclipsed by the new moon, while for the vast majority of viewers the sun will be only partially eclipsed.

More Solar Eclipse News:

As they did during 2017's solar eclipse across America, the American Astronomical Society (AAS) issued a news release Friday calling out the counterfeit and fake eclipse glasses that have been flooding the market.

The AAS said that fraudulently printed and counterfeit glasses are not safe for solar viewing and ""can cause severe eye injury, ranging from temporarily impaired vision to permanent blindness.""

If you plan to buy a pair of eclipse glasses, make sure they're from a vendor that is approved by the AAS. If you've already bought a pair and want to test that they're legit before the big day, they'll need to pass three tests.

First, ""put them on indoors and look around. You shouldn't be able to see anything through them, except perhaps very bright lights, which should appear very faint through the glasses,"" according to the AAS. Secondly, wear them outside and check if you can see anything other than ""the sun's reflection off a shiny surface or a puddle, which again should appear very faint."" Third, look at the sun and if it's ""comfortably bright,"" you're in the clear.

If you want to make a pinhole camera, here is a nifty video that shows you how. EarthSky.org states that the procedure was ""devised by the awesome engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.""

Christian Sandström and Christian Steinbeck analysed wind-power companies' annual reports in Sweden and their work revealed ""significant financial problems"", they told Swedish media outlet Kvartal on February 28.

""The total loss for the years 2017-2022 amounted to 13.5 billion Swedish krona [€1.2 billion], which meant a loss margin of 39 per cent,"" they said about the sector.

Such heavy losses seem to be the rule rather than the exception for wind-power companies in Sweden, according to the annual reports.

The Swedish Government has been pushing its national energy policies in a ""green"" direction, promoting wind power and decommissioning nuclear power plants. But the cost appears to be much more painful than previously thought, the economists stressed.

Sandström and Steinbeck have been pointing towards profitability problems in the wind sector for some time ""despite suppliers benefiting from Government support through electricity certificates and being exempt from covering the entire expenses associated with grid adaptation for wind energy or the depreciation of properties near installations"".

Since the economists' initial findings, Markbygden Ett, Sweden's largest wind-farm installation with 179 turbines, is already facing bankruptcy, stacking up hundreds of millions of krona in debt.

The firm is not alone - many other alternative-power companies in Sweden are in trouble.

Sandström and Steinbeck pointed out that the sector as a whole has not made a profit in any year since 2017.

Company losses have ranged from 19 per cent to 90 per cent of turnover between 2017 and 2022, they said.

""The losses are simply because the industry cannot produce electricity at a cost below the market price, despite extensive subsidies,"" the economists noted.

""That would put any other industry out of business, [although] the rate of investment has been very high.""

Both newer and older plants in the heavily subsidised industry shed cash, while economies of scale are also a limitation. The biggest farms make the biggest losses and only moderate-sized wind farms, with between 20 and 30 turbines, are turning any profits and those are at best described as ""modest"".

Costs have failed to come down despite growing experience among those operating in the sector and the researchers did not observe any correlation between time elapsed and increased electricity production from existing turbines.

""Just as sailors on sailing ships once had to pray to higher powers for wind to get somewhere, wind farms can only wait for the right amount of wind,"" they added.

On top of that, just 20 per cent of wind turbines in Sweden are Swedish owned. The rest are operated by foreign enterprises. Some 13 per cent of the reviewed turbines are Chinese.

Sandström and Steinbeck said the Chinese investors made their calculations based on ""wind mapping"" carried out by the Swedish Energy Agency and they have doubts about the accuracy of the data.

Also hammering profits is the fact that large parts of the Swedish wind-power industry cannot transfer or save power over-generation, meaning electricity needs to be consumed instantly or not at all - making it effectively unsustainable.

A few wind farms in the South of the country have gained financial momentum in recent years but all the others are stacking up more losses.

The academics noted that the change in the Swedish energy mix - decommissioning nuclear plants in favour of wind power - was politically driven and that no robust, financial independent industry has subsequently emerged.

A peculiar paradox also haunts the sector, the economists stressed. Low levels of wind leads to high electricity prices yet it also hinders electricity delivery.

On the flip side, when the wind is more powerful, oversupply drives down prices when there is ample electricity for sale.

""It is difficult to see a way out of this dilemma,"" Sandström and Steinbeck concluded.

https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/03/icy-blast-of-bankruptcies-loom-for-swedish-wind-power-sector-experts-warn/

Three things stand out here.

One is that Sweden does not appear to have our system of constraint payments:

Second is the fact that low winds mean high market prices, and vice versa. Obviously wind farms make their money when the wind blows, so low prices at those times drastically impact earnings.

1:00 JST, March 24, 2024

GREENSBORO, N.C. -- The president of Honda Aircraft Co., a U.S. subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., said the aircraft manufacturer aims to sell 60 HondaJet small business aircraft annually by 2028, about three times more than in 2023.

Honda Aircraft President Hideto Yamasaki said in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun that he plans for the company to have a surplus by 2028 when production of the new business jet HondaJet Echelon starts.Since launching HondaJet in 2015, Honda Aircraft has sold about 30 aircraft a year on average worldwide and has made approximately 250 deliveries in total.

The HondaJet Echelon can accommodate up to 11 people up from eight for existing HondaJet models. It also has better fuel efficiency and can fly longer distances compared to competitors' small business jets.

The HondaJet Echelon has a range of about 4,860 kilometers -- 1.7 times that of conventional small business jets -- making it the first small business aircraft capable of flying across North America nonstop.

Honda Aircraft plans to acquire a U.S. certification, which proves the HondaJet Echelon's safety, in 2028 and aims to sell 40 of the aircraft annually.

The aircraft manufacturer plans to increase sales using both conventional aircraft that cost about $7 million (¥1 billion) each and the Echelon. Yamasaki said Honda Aircraft will also increase the number of employees from 1,000 to 1,500 by 2028.

Yamasaki said the company also plans to focus on sales of used aircraft to broaden the base of small business jet users.

Honda Aircraft has been losing money since the company was established in 2006. Its sales volume declined from 2022 to 2023, mainly due to a global shortage of semiconductors amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Yamasaki expects Echelon to be a ""game changer.""

Honda Aircraft's competitors include Textron Aviation Inc., a U.S. company that has Cessna, a well-known brand in Japan, as an affiliated company.

""The technology we have developed as an automobile company will be an advantage for us,"" Yamasaki said, showing his intention to differentiate Honda Aircraft models from its competitors by focusing on comfort and other features.

In recent years, global sales of business jets often used by company executives and wealthy individuals have stayed steady at around 700 a year. About 800 business jets were sold in 2019, but sales have been sluggish partly because of travel restrictions imposed in various countries during the pandemic.

HondaJet enjoys a large share, or about 40%, of the market for very light jets that can accommodate four to eight people.

However, the annual sales volume of the very light jet market is about 60, which is less than 10% of the entire business jet market.

As the annual sales of light jets, which can accommodate about 10 people, is around 170, Honda Aircraft aims to increase its sales by entering the market with the HondaJet Echelon.

Honda Aircraft plans to invest $55.7 million (¥8 billion) to develop the Echelon.

""We would like to emphasize the Echelon's advantage in terms of high fuel efficiency and market it to those who are also interested in decarbonization,"" Yamasaki said.",japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,news,japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,,0.2392156862745098,448919048,1,https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Honda-aircraft-1.jpg,

If you're looking for a word to sum up this year's CERAWeek by S&P Global, try this one: demand.

Whether they were discussing oil, gas, power or renewables, speakers at the giant Houston talkfest were optimistic about consumption.

Any debate about energy these days is often presented as a choice between fossil fuels and low-carbon alternatives, but it's becoming clear that right now the world needs all of the above.

In part, that's about economic growth. The US appears to be in rude health, and President Joe Biden's push for reindustrialization is energy-hungry. India is expanding rapidly, and even China, where the property sector remains troubled, looks better than feared.

Take oil. Less than three months into 2024 and demand expectations are already being revised higher, helping drive a modest rally in prices.

""The US economy, in particular, has surprised to the upside,"" Saad Rahim, Trafigura Group's chief economist, said in an interview. ""Oil demand is performing better than expectations.""

But it's power that really dominated the conversations at the Hilton Americas-Houston hotel.

The energy transition was always going to be electricity-heavy as people trade internal combustion engines for EVs and swap gas boilers for heat pumps. But the artificial intelligence revolution potentially adds rocket fuel to demand.

One eye-popping forecast touted this week: By 2030, the surge in AI means US data centers may gobble up more power than households.

Despite the boom in solar power, it's unlikely renewables can handle that. At the very least, that means existing fossil-fuel generators stay online longer and more gas-fired output probably will be required in the US and elsewhere.

""With this huge revolution around artificial intelligence, I think the energy needs are going to be enormous,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told the conference.

Getting carbon out of the world's energy supply by midcentury was always a tall order, but the buoyant demand outlook across all parts of the system today shows just how hard that's going to be.

Key CERAWeek takeaways

Big Oil presented a confident front in Houston. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser set the tone Monday by forecasting years of rising fossil-fuel consumption while knocking the energy transition.

The oil market appears to be tighter than forecast at the start of the year. And there was genuine concern about the impact on fuel supplies from drone strikes on Russian refineries.

Exxon Mobil Corp. boss Darren Woods said he has no plans to elbow aside Chevron Corp. and buy Hess Corp. But questions remain about the Exxon-Chevron dispute over Guyana.

For Martin Lazo, lead of TxDOT's Highway Emergency Response Operator team, the memory of the 2023 annular eclipse remains vivid. The eerie darkness that enveloped the sky during the midday hours left an indelible impression. Now, as Texas braces for its first total solar eclipse since 1878, Lazo and his team are poised to handle the anticipated surge in traffic.

""We're accustomed to operating in low-light conditions,"" remarks Lettie Casares, senior operator of the HERO team, emphasizing their readiness for the upcoming celestial event.

With preparations spanning two years, TxDOT aims to ensure smooth traffic flow and enhanced safety measures during the eclipse. Spanning 480 miles across Texas, the ""path of totality"" is expected to witness heavy traffic before, during, and after the event.

Matthew Heinze, TxDOT's emergency management coordinator, underscores the significance of the eclipse, anticipating a million visitors traversing Texas to witness the rare phenomenon.

Collaborating with multiple state agencies, TxDOT orchestrates a comprehensive response plan, deploying crews equipped with traffic control tools and messaging signage. Special attention is given to highway safety, with reminders urging motorists to refrain from stopping on highways to view the eclipse.

To facilitate traffic management, TxDOT halts certain road construction and maintenance activities along major corridors during the eclipse period, ensuring smoother travel experiences for commuters.

Amidst preparations, TxDOT urges public cooperation and proactive planning. Travelers are advised to anticipate heavier traffic and plan their routes accordingly. DriveTexas.org offers real-time traffic updates to aid travelers in navigating congestion.

Emphasizing safety, TxDOT encourages viewers to find designated parking spots before the eclipse and refrain from impeding traffic flow. A courteous and patient attitude on the road is emphasized, alongside environmental stewardship to preserve Texas' natural beauty.

Aware of potential challenges, Lazo and Casares advise eclipse viewers to arrive early at their designated spots to avoid congestion. Patience and cooperation are sought from motorists to facilitate emergency response efforts.

The eclipse's trajectory will enter Texas at the Mexico-U.S. border near Eagle Pass, progressing across the state and exiting near Texarkana. Totality durations vary by location, with major cities such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and Fort Worth in the eclipse's path.

Digital kiosks at TxDOT Travel Information Centers will disseminate eclipse information, while highway signs will convey safety messages to motorists.

Some Wall Street firms including spot Bitcoin ETF issuer BlackRock Inc, MicroStrategy Incorporated, and Coinbase Global Inc are strengthening their BTC position, contributing to imminent supply shock on the horizon.

There were eleven top HODLers outlined in a published chart from the crypto analytics platform HODL15Capital. The chart showed details of how much Bitcoin these Wall Street companies currently have in their portfolio. The list features spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, software firms, exchanges, and crypto miners, underscoring the growing diversity in the embrace of the cryptocurrency.

BlackRock IBIT holds the largest amount of Bitcoin, surpassing MicroStrategy which has held the position for the longest possible time. Precisely, the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF holds a total of 243,125 units of BTC. Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy has approximately 214,246 Bitcoin following its last purchase and this gives the business intelligence and software firm 1% of the total BTC supply.

These two companies are followed by another spot Bitcoin ETF issuer Fidelity Investments with 136,034 Bitcoin. ARK 21Shares ARKB and Bitwise BITB were next with Bitcoin holdings of 40,298 and 30,292 respectively. Popular Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital was also on the chart, holding approximately 16,930 units of Bitcoin.

Other companies with significant Bitcoin holdings were Tesla, Coinbase, and even Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. which had the lowest volume of BTC at 8,027 units.

With these top Wall Street firms increasing their BTC holdings, a supply shock may just be underway. For context, regular exchanges and trading platforms may be left with little or no Bitcoin for their regular customers. This supply pressure has already been brewing on some exchanges for some time and may eventually take over the broader industry.

All of these developments are coming at a time when Bitcoin is trying to find its footing with frequent price fluctuations. Bitcoin price was at $65,416.36 at press time after hitting around $73,000 about a week ago. Many experts and analysts believe that the cryptocurrency is still within a healthy retracement.

So far, the price of the coin has tumbled by over 4.5% suggesting that BTC is grappling to make a sustainable recovery.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

By Willie N. Tokpah

The amended date was February 3, 2014, between the government and Liberia International Shipping and Corporate Registry (LISCR), following an earlier engagement of the agent in 2009 to assist the government perform the services of improving the viability and great profit of the Liberia Registry.

The faster dream of the government to gain needed revenue from the operation of the registry may not be feasible if the need to review said amendment is not considered, as no Liberian had the opportunity to work at the Registry, except those with American Citizenship

The Liberian Registry - the world's second-largest Registry - represents 12 percent of the world's ocean-going fleet. Liberia has earned international respect for its dedication to flagging the world's safest and most secure vessels. The Liberian Registry is administered by the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR, LLC).""

What is so concerning is the fact that no Liberian has a say in the day-to-day operations of the firm, to know how many dollars are being generated since the agreement requires Liberia to have a share of profits. How much profit the firm is making, is unknown, especially when the agreement elected that only American Citizens can work for the Registry.

The Liberian Registry, according to a FrontPageAfrica investigation, was established, bearing the Liberian emblem to enable LIMCO to easily ship its goods out of Liberia, and was giving rights to other citizens in the US to own properties as well as establishing other multi-corporations.

However, to gain the confidence of their business partners, they needed the Liberian Government's backing for which they reached the Sirleaf administration.

Furthermore, this agreement which only calls for American citizens to work at the registry instead of considering Liberians places the interest of citizens far below the belt since it denied Liberians job opportunities.

Also, only those who signed the agreement know what is in it, something interest Liberiabs believed has the potential to withhold needed revenues coming to Liberia, because no Liberian is in the employ of the registry to know how many profits are being generated annually.

At the same time, the agreement has just this year, (2024) as an expiration duration and the risk it poses to Liberia is that failure to revisit said agreement will place the Liberian Shipping Registry Private Owners have a right of automatic renewal for 10 years.

The topic of the Liberian Registry began

Former Secretary of State and the first United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Edward R. Stettinius Jr., assists in drafting a corporate and maritime code for Liberia.

First Flagged

On March 11, 1949, the oil tanker ""World Peace"", owned by Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, and under the Getty Oil Company, became the first vessel to fly the Liberian Flag.

This moment would mark the inception of a steadfast and esteemed partnership between the Liberian Registry and the Greek shipping community.

The Agreement

The demanded date was February 3, 2014, between the government, represented by Binyah C. Kessely, then Commissioner and CEO of Liberia Maritime Authority, and Liberia International Shipping and Corporate Registry (LISCR), a single-purpose limited liability company organized under the law of the State of Delaware, USA and represented by Yaram Cohem, Chairman as an agent. It was attested by then, Minister Amara Konneh and Justice Minister Benedict Sarnoh, ratified by the Legislature and approved by former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to be amended every 10 years or shall automatically be extended to 10 years.

Under this agreement, the approved operational budget by the LMA Board shall be funded by program revenue operated by the Liberia Registry.

The agreement also noted that the government of Liberia shall receive 70% seventy percent of the net program revenues while the agent, LISCR received 30% beginning January 1, 2015.

Disadvantaged to Liberia

As it stands the Liberian Government is not aware of the total revenue generated by the registry, since Liberian Citizens cannot be employed at the registry, which puts the government at a disadvantage in knowing what is supposed to come to the country and it has had no economic benefits on ordinary Liberians.

At the same time, FrontPageAfrica has gathered that besides the registry's current engagement with the Liberia Maritime Institute Training Program, as part of its obligations to operate and maintain the existing Liberian Registry, concerns are being raised over the whereabouts of US$ 50,000 (Fifty Thousands United States Dollars, that the agents agreed to pay of its income earned to corporate social responsibility programs over the existing years of the agreement.

*Risk and What Needs To Be Done

Currently, the registry is the largest but its economic impact on Liberia remains a major concern.

The risk is that failure on the part of the government to notify the need for amendment or a new agreement or cancellation of the said pact, the agreement will automatically be deleted, giving the agent, LISRC to run the registry for an additional 10 years.

Article VIII Section 8.02 and 8.03 of the Maritime Amendment states, '

""The agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following inserted: In the event, the government elects not to buy out under Section 11:06 of the agreement, the agent or its successor as its option shall be entitled to a further extension of the agreement for a period of additional 10 years. However, government, under the agreement is to notify the agent not less than two years, before the termination of the agreement, on or before December 31, 2027.""

However, there are suggestions from the public that considering the setting of an Asset Recovery Team by the Joseph Nyumah the Boakai administration, it is important to focus on a possible inquiry of said agreement with less than two years to its expiration.

The concerns are being raised by mostly Liberians who are based in the United States of America, who prefer anonymity, that the trend being taken by the agent of the registry, to directly operate other non-related maritime businesses directly under the registry which bears the Liberiab flag constitute default of the existence agreement.

Under Article 4(C) of the agreement, the agent agrees not to operate the Liberian Registry in any manner or for any purpose other than what was set forth, but its subsidiaries or affiliates of interest may engage in business other than the operation of the Liberian Registry.

However, FPA had gathered from sources close to the registry, that the agent is now using the Liberian Flag to ensure that individuals own housing estates and are operating other businesses under the umbrella of the Flag Administrator Shipping Registry and Corporate Registry Business, which according to the agreement, constitute insolvency.

Hence, the concern Liberians are contending is that it's even more appropriate since the government has established an Asset recovery team, for the team to recover the flag being misused by foreigners.

When wind turbines rotate, however, they generate not only electricity but also infrasound.

""With ever larger wind turbines, the frequencies are getting lower and lower. This makes infrasound more problematic and dangerous,"" Dr. Bellut-Staeck told The Epoch Times.

Infrasound has another special feature. Humans cannot usually hear frequencies below 16 Hz, which marks the so-called lower hearing threshold. In other words, we cannot hear many of the sounds emitted by wind turbines. However, we may feel them in our bodies as humming or rumbling, as with a loudspeaker. The lower the frequency, the higher the sound pressure level (i.e., the volume) must be to feel or hear it.

""Since around 2015, it has been noticed that people exposed to infrasound and vibration from technical emitters have shown symptoms that correspond to microcirculatory disorders,"" Dr. Bellut-Staeck said. This effect was particularly noticeable after smaller wind turbines were replaced by larger ones.

""The symptoms in animals cannot be [attributed to] a nocebo effect,"" Dr. Bellut-Staeck noted, as official authorities sometimes suggest. In contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect describes a negative health effect from expectations of negative consequences.

Dr. Bellut-Staeck pointed out that other technical systems also emit infrasound and could cause major problems. For example, in or near residences, this applies to heat pumps, biogas plants, and gas turbines. However, she expects large wind turbines to have the most far-reaching consequences for the environment and biodiversity -- precisely because of their increasing number and size.

But Dr. Bellut-Staeck remains concerned by the low-frequency sound and vibrations of ship noise and other sounds. In the ocean, sound travels at 0.91 miles per second -- four times faster than in the air. The depth of the oceans, therefore, offers no protection against sound.

These studies emphasize the need for further research and a better understanding of the impacts of infrasound.",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,-0.07450980392156858,448918561,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/04/id5600189-Shutterstock_572474173-1080x720.jpg,

As a sophomore, McKenna had a slightly different season as she did not make NCAAs swimming a season best of a 52.82 at midseason before swimming a 53.42 at 2023 Big Tens.

Sometimes, it takes a step back to go three steps forward (not one step forward and three steps back). This season, McKenna won her first Big Ten title swimming to a 50.49 in the 100 backstroke. At NCAAs, McKenna swam even faster in prelims with a 50.23 to be the #2 seed heading into finals only behind Gretchen Walsh. McKenna swam a 50.65 in finals to finish 6th.

Positivity has been a key part of both McKenna's growth and success. She also mentioned that making changes and figuring out what did not work last season has also been key to her success.

""I think coming into this year after last year with a new mindset, just being a lot more positive and setting new goals has been really helpful and sort of realizing what wasn't working for me last year and then making a really, really big emphasis on fixing those problems before even trying to do anything new in training or in swimming,"" McKenna said.

With positivity also comes some confidence and happiness. ""I had really low confidence last year, and I was not the happiest swimmer outside of the water."" There is the saying, 'a happy swimmer makes a fast swimmer' and McKenna explained that herself saying, ""It's really hard to be a happy swimmer and a fast swimmer when you're not happy and well outside of swimming.""

McKenna recognized that things outside of the pool can affect things inside of the pool so she worked for a change.

""I was having a hard time with feeling like there are things that swimming was keeping me from doing, like spending time with friends or getting to see my family. I tried to fix those problems before moving on to fixing the swimming problems,"" McKenna said.

As McKenna was consistently faster this season, swimming a best time at midseason, another at a dual meet in January, and finally at Big Tens before NCAAs, she tried to make sure she did not put pressure on herself.",swimswam.com,news,SwimSwam,Anya Pelshaw,0.4666666666666666,448918550,1,https://swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240322_WSD_NCAAs_Prelims_TSB_1766-scaled.jpg,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

Some tips to prepare for April's total solar eclipse,"MISSION, Kan. - Stock up on groceries. Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

WHY ALL THE WARNINGS?

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

CELLPHONES MIGHT NOT WORK

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Austin.

STOCK UP ON FUEL AND FOOD

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation. ""This is nuts,"" he said.

PREP

ARATIONS IN THE AIR AND AT SEA

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. 'We didn't expect this,'"" said Amos.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

BRACE FOR TRAFFIC HASSLE

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, said Raetzke.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

Despite the hassles, the city's tourism slogan to get eclipse-ready -- SHINE -- ends with a reminder.

The long-term weather records had suggested that there was a 70-percent chance of clear or partly cloudy skies, which was the primary reason why so many had gravitated to this community, normally populated by only about 8,000.

On that dank and dreary Saturday. scientists from around the world stood in the clutter of their cameras and gauges, shaking their heads and waiting in vain for even a brief glimpse of the eclipsed sun. As the moon's giant shadow swept in on schedule, an eerie afternoon darkness fell over the landscape, accompanied by croaking frogs and chirping insects.

Max Waldmeier (1912 - 2000) a Swiss astronomer and director of the Zurich Observatory, who had a special interest in the sun, had planned this trip to Perry for two years with his scientific team, mainly because of its statistically encouraging meteorological patterns. But after the moon's shadow had passed, Professor Waldmeier was near tears as he helped his colleagues dismantle their heavy equipment.

This melancholy tale contrasts sharply with that of three amateur astronomers, who also came to Perry for the eclipse. But instead of staying under the gloomy skies, they quickly piled their equipment into a rental car and drove through the night more than 350 miles (560 kilometers) to Poston, South Carolina, where they found nearly cloud-free skies.

At noon on eclipse day, they set up their various instruments in a tobacco field, where they watched the southwest sky change from gray to pink and then to violet-gray as the moon's shadow rushed in. They saw Baily's beads and the scarlet solar chromosphere and the whitish solar corona, brighter than a full moon, as well as irregularities in the moon's dark edge against the brilliant corona. As totality ended, a yellow ""diamond ring"" signaled that the spectacular event was over. Said one of the three observers: ""It was the shortest three minutes of my life!""

So, if you really want to see the upcoming total eclipse, the moral is simple:

""Stay mobile!""

One should always remember that long-term climatological statistics -- no matter how reliable -- are not absolute.

In his 1973 novel, ""Time Enough for Love,"" science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein came up with the following aphorism: ""Climate is what we expect, weather is what we get!""

How true this is!

And what happened at Perry, Florida in 1970 is far from being an isolated incident. Indeed, it has certainly happened more than a few times with other eclipses over the years.

Another excellent example of this is the total solar eclipse of July 11, 1991. The Big Island of Hawaii was entirely within the totality path. Climatology dictated that when the northeast trade winds blow, the eastern (windward) side of the island would see heavy clouds and rain, while on the sheltered lee (western side) of the island, the trades would blow downslope and dry out. Since the trade winds blow 95 percent of the time in July, the assumption was that clear skies were a given for the western side of Hawaii. Unfortunately, a tropical upper tropospheric trough (""TUTT"") moved over the Big Island on eclipse day, bringing more clouds than sun and disappointing the tens of thousands of people who had come to Hawaii to view the eclipse.

In recent weeks, I have spoken to many people who have made arrangements to witness the April 8 eclipse from Texas. Remarks typically are along the lines of: ""I've chosen Texas because that's where the odds by far, favor clear skies."" In actuality, however, the weather outlook from Texas through the Deep South looks only marginal at best.

Climatological records indicate little difference, from the point of view of weather from Texas to Arkansas. Throughout this area, average cloud cover in April is consistently about 60-65 percent. Clear days occur on April 8 in about 45-50 percent of the years for which records are available, and the chances of seeing the eclipsed sun at any given moment on April 8 is about 55-60 percent. Admittedly, these conditions are somewhat better than those for the Northeast United States, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada, but, surprisingly, not that much better.

In short, April weather is extremely variable and changeable, so at any location along the totality path, there is some hope of very clear skies (or dense clouds) on eclipse day.

Truly reliable meteorological weather forecasts for eclipse day are not possible more than a week or so ahead of time. For mid-latitudes during late winter and early spring, large daily deviations from normal frequently occur. We must also take into account the eclipse itself, for even if April 8 starts with exactly normal cloud cover, it would not be normal at the time of totality because of the roughly 75-minute interval of increasing partial eclipse. During that interval, the reduced solar heating will result in a cooling of the local atmosphere, attended by decreased cumuliform clouds as well as an increase of stratiform cloudiness, as has actually been observed at past eclipses.

So, if, on eclipse day, your observing site has blue skies mixed with a scattered-to-broken layer of puffy cumulus clouds just prior to the start of the eclipse, you might want to stay right where you are, because as the partial phases progress and the sun wanes to a thin crescent, the ambient air temperature will likely fall and those convective clouds -- driven by warming sunlight -- will dissipate. Conversely, if the local atmosphere is somewhat humid or muggy, low-stratus clouds or even fog could develop as the air cools.

In view of such weather uncertainties, plans about where to observe should be kept flexible up to the latest possible time before the eclipse, which (as was the case in 2017) occurs on a Monday.

Right now, NOAA's Weather Prediction Center is providing increasingly reliable forecast products, which will enable people to choose a location where the chances of a cloudy sky are low. These can be augmented by forecasts issued by National Weather Service forecast offices located near and along the totality path.

By this upcoming weekend, it will be time to shift from FORE-casting to NOW-casting: The very latest meteorological data, including careful scrutiny of satellite images and radar scans, should be used to modify the plans based on climatological data only.

Eclipse chasers today have a tremendous advantage over those from just 20 years ago, in that they can now utilize their smartphone screens to view satellite and radar imagery, as well as GPS data to help make last-minute moves on local roadways. An excellent hard-copy reference guide to augment your digital data is the ""Road Atlas for the Total Solar Eclipse of 2024"" by retired NASA astrophysicist and avid eclipse chaser, Fred Espenak. The Atlas contains a comprehensive series of 26 maps of the path of totality across Mexico, the USA and Canada.

Finally . . . as we stressed earlier . . . a mobile strategy will offer you the highest probability of witnessing this greatest of celestial road shows, for regardless of where you plan to be, staying mobile to dodge cloud cover will always enhance your chances.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

Print off driving directions. And be very, very patient.

Small towns and rural enclaves along the path of April's total solar eclipse are steeling for huge crowds of sun chasers who plan to catch a glimpse of day turning into dusk in North America.

Tourism and community leaders in the path of totality from Texas to Maine have trucked in extra fuel and port-a-potties, and urged residents and visitors to be prepared. Some counties have issued disaster declarations to get extra help with policing and other aid, similar to the aftermath of severe storms. And in Oklahoma, the National Guard will help.

Because of expected heavy traffic and other disruptions, hundreds of schools are closing or switching to remote learning in states including Texas, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Look no further back than the last U.S. total solar eclipse in 2017 to understand the concern, said Tom Traub, who is part of NASA's eclipse ambassador program.

That year, he traveled to Beatrice, Nebraska, where the normal population of around 12,000 swelled to around 40,000 as eclipse watchers arrived.

""You had gas stations running out of gas,"" said Traub, who also serves on the board that runs the Martz-Kohl Observatory near Frewsburg, New York. ""You had restaurants running out of food. You had restrooms that were full and closed.""

This time around, top viewing locations want to avoid a repeat.

""They are preparing for mostly a worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""And hopefully that won't be the case.""

In central Texas, emergency officials in Hays County recommend a ""solar eclipse survival bag"" stocked with items including a mobile phone and charger.

The bag, the instructions advise, also should contain a hard copy of maps and a compass -- ""goin' old school!""

The reminder to bring a fully charged phone -- but to expect possible jammed signals -- is widespread in prime viewing spots. In 2017, drivers using their cellphones to share photos and navigate through traffic overwhelmed towers.

""Write down key phone numbers just in case,"" advised the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, about 50 miles east of Austin.

Don't wait until the last minute to buy groceries is common advice from several Texas counties that have issued disaster declarations so they can get get extra help with the crowds.

Among them is Kerr County, about 65 miles northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where the normal population of 53,000 is expected to double or triple.

""Make sure your vehicles are tanked up, that you have sufficient grocery supplies, that your prescriptions are filled and that you are stocked up on provisions for any animals in your care,"" Rob Kelly, the county's top official who signed the disaster declaration, said in an online post.

In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order this month to assure the state was well-prepared, emergency management officials are urging residents to top off their gas tanks or fully charge their electric vehicles before heading out.

Traub suggests people treat the eclipse like a snowstorm: ""Stock up, get ready, prepare to hunker down.""

At Serafin's Food Market in Erie, Pennsylvania, owner Dan Serafin is ordering extra milk, eggs, water and batteries in preparation.

""This is nuts,"" he said.

Even smaller regional airports are getting ready. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, extra fuel is being hauled in, said airport manager Katrina Amos.

The airport was caught off guard in 2017, when the city of around 40,000 along the Mississippi River also was in the path of totality.

Between 40 to 50 extra planes landed that day. ""We didn't expect this,"" Amos said.

This year, volunteers have signed up to help park all the extra planes that are expected. There also will be hamburgers and hot dogs, Amos said.

Offshore, the Coast Guard will have boats patrolling in Lake Erie; it's along the path and some boaters plan to watch from the water.

It will be all hands on deck at fire departments in the path of the eclipse, said Dr. Brad Raetzke, an emergency room doctor in Columbus, Ohio, who also is a medical director for several fire departments in the area.

He's concerned about eye injuries if people stare at the sun without protective glasses. And with all the extra traffic, there also will likely be more crash injuries, Raetzke said.

In 2017, he went with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, to watch the eclipse. The return trip took 15 hours, instead of the typical six. ""So I can understand the importance of planning,"" he said.

In Erie, where hotels are nearing capacity, residents are urged to leave the interstates to visitors, with signs posted more than 150 miles outside the city limits warning of delays.

Traffic will be ""just almost nightmarish once totality ends,"" said Chris Temple, the VisitErie spokesperson, who has been in meetings for more than a year planning for an onslaught of visitors that could double the size of the city of 94,000.

The facility says it could take four to seven days to get under control as crews work to restore power.

They also said they want to minimize any noise, light, or smoke associated with flaring.

The flaring could be seen on Houston TranStar cameras near SH-225 and La Porte near Underwood. The facility did not elaborate on if surrounding neighborhoods were impacted.

Flaring is said to be a key component in keeping the plant safe, the company said. Once flared, the hydrocarbon has been safely treated and the potential emission have been reduced by 98%.

However, in a statement sent by Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo on Saturday, she said the county's pollution control department did not receive specific answers on exactly what chemicals are being burned.

Hidalgo says this incident shouldn't be accepted as ""business as usual.""

This innovation advances the field toward realizing energy-efficient, nanoscale computing with unparalleled computational power.

Details of their findings were published in npj Spintronics on March 1, 2024.

The brain is the ultimate computer and scientists are constantly striving to create neuromorphic devices that mimic the brain's processing capabilities, low power consumption, and its ability to adapt to neural networks. The development of neuromorphic computing is revolutionary, allowing scientists to explore nanoscale realms, GHz speed, with low energy consumption.

In recent years, many advances in computational models inspired by the brain have been made. These artificial neural networks have demonstrated extraordinary performances in various tasks. However, current technologies are software-based; their computational speed, size, and energy consumption remain constrained by the properties of conventional electric computers.

RC works via a fixed, randomly generated network called the 'reservoir.' The reservoir enables the memorization of past input information and its nonlinear transformation. This unique characteristic allows for the integration of physical systems, such as magnetization dynamics, to perform various tasks for sequential data, like time-series forecasting and speech recognition.

Some have proposed spintronics as a means to realize high-performance devices. But devices produced so far have failed to live up to expectations. In particular, they have failed to achieve high performance at nanoscales with GHz speed.

""Our study proposed a physical RC that harnessed propagating spin waves,"" says Natsuhiko Yoshinaga, co-author of the paper and associate professor at the Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR). ""The theoretical framework we developed utilized response functions that link input signals to propagating spin dynamics. This theoretical model elucidated the mechanism behind the high performance of spin wave RC, highlighting the scaling relationship between wave speed and system size to optimize the effectiveness of virtual nodes.""

Crucially, Yoshinaga and his colleagues helped clarify the mechanism for high-performance reservoir computing. In doing so, they harnessed various subfields, namely condensed matter physics and mathematical modeling.

""By employing the unique properties of spintronics technology, we have potentially paved the way for a new era of intelligent computing, leading us closer to realizing a physical device that can be put to use in weather forecasts and speech recognition"" adds Yoshinaga.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Labor governments and Coalition oppositions in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are either outright opposed to the plan or have failed to endorse it.

Most of those states have their own bans on nuclear that would need to be lifted in addition to the federal ban if Dutton's plan were to progress.

Despite this, the federal opposition leader has repeatedly called for nuclear to be considered as part of the future energy mix for Australia.

Here's how the debate is playing out around Australia.

It is illegal to run any forms of nuclear facilities in Queensland, including power stations and radioactive waste dumps. Any change to this would need to be passed by parliament.

David Crisafulli, the Liberal National party leader, is the bluntest in his opposition to Dutton's plan.

When asked if he supported the federal Liberal leader and fellow Queenslander's energy campaign earlier in the week, the opposition leader said: ""No, we don't.""

""Until both sides of Canberra agree, that will never happen because there won't be investment,"" Crisafulli said.

The state's deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said debate was ""many years"" away and the party was focused on the cost of living in the immediate future.

""People are hurting, they need to see their electricity bills reduced now and that has to be our priority,"" he told Sky News.

Similarly, in NSW there is a ban on uranium mining and nuclear power for electricity generation.

The state's shadow energy minister, James Griffin, said he supported a ""rational discussion about nuclear energy"" but stopped short of endorsing the federal Coalition's proposal.

""As a nation, we shouldn't be scared of having a rational discussion about nuclear energy, but that should not come at the expense of getting on with the urgent job in front of us,"" he said.

""We sure as hell don't have time to waste in implementing our NSW net zero roadmap.

""The NSW Coalition is committed to working collaboratively with the commonwealth and federal Coalition on a forward-looking energy policy that will deliver energy security, alongside clean and reliable energy.""

Despite Griffin's lukewarm response, Anthony Roberts, a former minister and the Lane Cove Liberal MP, said he had ""always maintained an open mind"" on energy.

""[I] will always support the options that can deliver clean, cheap and reliable power,"" he said.

""Based on my numerous conversations with constituents, I believe they share my view.""

The premier, Chris Minns, has dismissed any nuclear energy strategy that uses modular reactors for NSW.

""The idea that we would rest our energy needs on that kind of untried energy solution for NSW would be folly,"" he said.

Minns said a nuclear industry for domestic energy use was ""so far-flung, so expensive, so beyond the outer limit of our immediate energy needs"" that it was not sensible to be talking about it.

The independent MP Greg Piper - who represents Lake Macquarie, where the Eraring power station is situated - said his constituents would have ""significant concerns"" about the station being converted into a nuclear power plant.

""The community would no doubt have a lot of questions about safety risks, waste disposal and legacy issues."" he said.

The MP said he had an open mind on the issue but at this stage, he does not see nuclear in the state's energy mix ""in the near future"".

A number of nuclear-related activities, including exploration for uranium and construction or operation of a nuclear reactor, are banned in Victoria.

Like its northern counterparts, the Victorian opposition has failed to endorse the federal Coalition's nuclear plans.

The shadow energy minister, David Davis, said ""the Victorian Liberals and Nationals support a commonsense transition to renewables that ensures affordability and security of supply"".

There are no state-level bans on nuclear power in place in South Australia and the premier, Peter Malinauskas, has repeatedly said he is open to or neutral towards the idea of nuclear power, but that the economics do not stack up.

SA is something of a nuclear state thanks to uranium mining and the prospect of building nuclear submarines, but Malinauskas does not think nuclear should be part of the power mix, not least because he has pledged that SA's power will be fully sourced from renewables by 2027.

The energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, said: ""While we have nothing in principle against nuclear power, this current debate is nothing but a distraction because it is not economically feasible or viable for Australia.""

The opposition leader, David Speirs, said ""all options should be on the table in the pursuit of an affordable, reliable and clean energy future"".

""That includes looking at new generation nuclear energy as a possible addition to our energy mix,"" he said.

Last week, Dutton claimed the annual report from science agency CSIRO that had included estimates of costs for small modular reactors - which are not yet available commercially - was ""discredited"" because it ""doesn't take into account some of the transmission costs, the costs around subsidies for the renewables"".

CSIRO rejected Dutton's claim that its estimates were unreliable, with its chief executive, Douglas Hilton, warning that maintaining trust ""requires our political leaders to resist the temptation to disparage science"".

The most recent GenCost report estimates a theoretical small modular reactor built in 2030 would cost $382 to $636 per MWh. It says this is much more expensive than solar and wind, which it puts at between $91 and $130 per MWh even once integration costs are included.

""The GenCost report can be trusted by all our elected representatives, irrespective of whether they are advocating for electricity generation by renewables, coal, gas or nuclear energy,"" Hilton said.

The federal Coalition is yet to produce a costed energy policy, despite arguing for a lift to Australia's ban on nuclear energy and suggesting it will nominate six potential sites for nuclear reactors around Australia - likely to be close to current or retiring coal-fired power stations.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.04313725490196085,448917614,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/9a44388f578012cf5c79ebce6e95fb09,eng-9416365

""It can also drive progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals - which are the foundation of peaceful societies - including by improving health, reducing poverty and inequality, and boosting food and water security,'' said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a message on World Water Day, held on 22 March every year since 1993, to focus on the importance of freshwater.

''Action for water is action for peace. And today it is needed more than ever.''

''Our world is in turbulent waters. Conflicts are raging, inequality is rife, pollution and biodiversity loss are rampant, and, as humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, the climate crisis is accelerating with a deadly force - further threatening peace, Guterres remarked.

''Water for peace is the theme of this year's World Water Day. Achieving it relies on far greater cooperation. Today, 153 countries share water resources. Yet only twenty-four have reported cooperation agreements for all their shared water. We must accelerate efforts to work together across borders, and I urge all countries to join and implement the United Nations Water Convention - which promotes managing shared water resources sustainably,'' he added.

Let's commit to work together, to make water a force for cooperation, harmony and stability, and so help to create a world of peace and prosperity for all, he concluded.

World Water Day, held on 22 March every year since 1993, is an annual United Nations Observance focusing on the importance of freshwater.

World Water Day celebrates water and raises awareness of the 2.2 billion people living without access to safe water. It is about taking action to tackle the global water crisis. A core focus of World Water Day is to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6: water and sanitation for all by 2030. (ANI/WAM)

The developer ofChatGPThas initiated discussions with film studios and hopes to integrate its generative modelSorain Hollywood productions.

According toBloomberg, OpenAI began planning discussions with Hollywood decision-makers in February, days after publicly announcing Sora. Generative AI model transforms user prompts into realistic clips; in other words, it tries to do for video what OpenAI GIVE HIM made for images.

OpenAI's first Hollywood discussions were led byBrad Lightcap, who serves as chief operating officer of the Microsoft-backed technology company. In recent weeks, OpenAI CEOSam Altmanalso embarked on negotiations. Four months after his reinstatement as head of OpenAI (he briefly ceded that role to former Twitch boss Emmett Shear), Altman attended industry parties in Los Angeles during Oscars weekend 2024.

The first people to gain access to Sora were ""red teams"" who searched for vulnerabilities in the software, but OpenAI is giving Hollywood notables advanced access so they can explore ways generative AI technology could help them in their work. According toBloomberg""a few big-name actors and directors"" were invited to take Sora for a test drive.

""OpenAI has a deliberate strategy of collaborating with industry through an iterative deployment process rolling out AI advances in stages to ensure safe implementation and give people an idea of what's coming next. 'horizon', we read. a statement from OpenAI. ""We look forward to continued dialogue with artists and creatives.""

The role of generative AI in the cinematic arts has been one of main talking points during the WGA and SAG strikes that hit Hollywood last year. The rise of deepfakes and other creative issues could make AI systems like Sora a tough sell in film and TV circles, but OpenAI will try to convince studios that its technology can be a benefit -- not a obstacle - for the film industry.",exbulletin.com,news,ExBulletin,,0.1137254901960785,448917503,1,https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/open-ai-sora-pitch.jpg,eng-9418295

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

Now, amid tough macroeconomic conditions, there's not enough work for those new hires. Firms now offer new hires stipends to start their jobs months later than planned. Accenture, for example, offered new hires out of college up to $25,000 to push their start dates back.

Some consulting firms are surviving the slowdown by reorganizing. Earlier this week, the FT reported that Deloitte has launched ""the biggest overhaul"" of its operations in a decade.

As part of the reorganization, Deloitte's main business units will be divided into four units -- down from five -- which will help reduce costs across the firm, the FT said. Deloitte's global chief executive Joe Ucuzoglu told the firm's partners by email that the reorganization will tamp down on the firm's ""complexity"" and ""free up"" more partners for client work instead of internally managing staff.

""We recently completed a thoughtful process to modernize and simplify Deloitte's storefront and go-to-market strategy. We are confident this will further enhance the exceptional quality and value we deliver to our clients and communities, as well as the vibrant career paths we provide our people,"" a spokesperson for Deloitte told Business Insider in a statement.

Despite all the doom and gloom, one bright spot for consulting firms is the promise of AI. The need to understand the new technology and how to implement it appears to be revving up demand for new projects at several firms.

Accenture reported that new bookings in generative AI brought in over $600 million in the most recent quarter and $1.1 billion through the first half of the fiscal year.

McKinsey said it's also seeing significant revenue related to generative AI, The Wall Street Journal reported. McKinsey senior partner Sven Smit told the Journal that there is demand on how to use generative AI for both productivity and restructuring workforces.",businessinsider.com,news,Business Insider,Lakshmi Varanasi,-0.04313725490196074,448917471,1,https://i.insider.com/65fceced2417f97b87ce47b8?width=1200&format=jpeg,

New England is battling a mix of wind, rain, sleet and heavy snow across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski county, but mostly rain, wind and possible flooding in southern areas and along the coast.

BOSTON (AP) -- It may officially be spring, but New England is battling a wintry weather combination across the region Saturday with more than a foot of snow expected in ski county, and rain, wind and possible flooding in southern areas and along the coast.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

Labor governments and Coalition oppositions in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are either outright opposed to the plan or have failed to endorse it.

Most of those states have their own bans on nuclear that would need to be lifted in addition to the federal ban if Dutton's plan were to progress.

Despite this, the federal opposition leader has repeatedly called for nuclear to be considered as part of the future energy mix for Australia.

Here's how the debate is playing out around Australia.

Queensland

It is illegal to run any forms of nuclear facilities in Queensland, including power stations and radioactive waste dumps. Any change to this would need to be passed by parliament.

David Crisafulli, the Liberal National party leader, is the bluntest in his opposition to Dutton's plan.

When asked if he supported the federal Liberal leader and fellow Queenslander's energy campaign earlier in the week, the opposition leader said: ""No, we don't.""

""Until both sides of Canberra agree, that will never happen because there won't be investment,"" Crisafulli said.

The state's deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said debate was ""many years"" away and the party was focused on the cost of living in the immediate future.

""People are hurting, they need to see their electricity bills reduced now and that has to be our priority,"" he told Sky News.

New South Wales

Similarly, in NSW there is a ban on uranium mining and nuclear power for electricity generation.

The state's shadow energy minister, James Griffin, said he supported a ""rational discussion about nuclear energy"" but stopped short of endorsing the federal Coalition's proposal.

""As a nation, we shouldn't be scared of having a rational discussion about nuclear energy, but that should not come at the expense of getting on with the urgent job in front of us,"" he said.

""We sure as hell don't have time to waste in implementing our NSW net zero roadmap.

""The NSW Coalition is committed to working collaboratively with the commonwealth and federal Coalition on a forward-looking energy policy that will deliver energy security, alongside clean and reliable energy.""

Despite Griffin's lukewarm response, Anthony Roberts, a former minister and the Lane Cove Liberal MP, said he had ""always maintained an open mind"" on energy.

""[I] will always support the options that can deliver clean, cheap and reliable power,"" he said.

""Based on my numerous conversations with constituents, I believe they share my view.""

The premier, Chris Minns, has dismissed any nuclear energy strategy that uses modular reactors for NSW.

""The idea that we would rest our energy needs on that kind of untried energy solution for NSW would be folly,"" he said.

Minns said a nuclear industry for domestic energy use was ""so far-flung, so expensive, so beyond the outer limit of our immediate energy needs"" that it was not sensible to be talking about it.

The independent MP Greg Piper - who represents Lake Macquarie, where the Eraring power station is situated - said his constituents would have ""significant concerns"" about the station being converted into a nuclear power plant.

""The community would no doubt have a lot of questions about safety risks, waste disposal and legacy issues."" he said.

The MP said he had an open mind on the issue but at this stage, he does not see nuclear in the state's energy mix ""in the near future"".

Victoria

A number of nuclear-related activities, including exploration for uranium and construction or operation of a nuclear reactor, are banned in Victoria.

Like its northern counterparts, the Victorian opposition has failed to endorse the federal Coalition's nuclear plans.

The shadow energy minister, David Davis, said ""the Victorian Liberals and Nationals support a commonsense transition to renewables that ensures affordability and security of supply"".

South Australia

There are no state-level bans on nuclear power in place in South Australia and the premier, Peter Malinauskas, has repeatedly said he is open to or neutral towards the idea of nuclear power, but that the economics do not stack up.

SA is something of a nuclear state thanks to uranium mining and the prospect of building nuclear submarines, but Malinauskas does not think nuclear should be part of the power mix, not least because he has pledged that SA's power will be fully sourced from renewables by 2027.

The energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, said: ""While we have nothing in principle against nuclear power, this current debate is nothing but a distraction because it is not economically feasible or viable for Australia.""

The opposition leader, David Speirs, said ""all options should be on the table in the pursuit of an affordable, reliable and clean energy future"".

""That includes looking at new generation nuclear energy as a possible addition to our energy mix,"" he said.

Coalition yet to produce costed nuclear energy policy

Last week, Dutton claimed the annual report from science agency CSIRO that had included estimates of costs for small modular reactors - which are not yet available commercially - was ""discredited"" because it ""doesn't take into account some of the transmission costs, the costs around subsidies for the renewables"".

CSIRO rejected Dutton's claim that its estimates were unreliable, with its chief executive, Douglas Hilton, warning that maintaining trust ""requires our political leaders to resist the temptation to disparage science"".

The most recent GenCost report estimates a theoretical small modular reactor built in 2030 would cost $382 to $636 per MWh. It says this is much more expensive than solar and wind, which it puts at between $91 and $130 per MWh even once integration costs are included.

""The GenCost report can be trusted by all our elected representatives, irrespective of whether they are advocating for electricity generation by renewables, coal, gas or nuclear energy,"" Hilton said.

The federal Coalition is yet to produce a costed energy policy, despite arguing for a lift to Australia's ban on nuclear energy and suggesting it will nominate six potential sites for nuclear reactors around Australia - likely to be close to current or retiring coal-fired power stations.",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,"Tamsin Rose, Tory Shepherd, Catie McLeod",-0.05882352941176472,448917282,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/9a44388f578012cf5c79ebce6e95fb09,eng-9416365

The reef is essentially an anchor for giant kelp, which grows tall and thick to create the forests of the sea. A form of brown algae, the kelp reaches from the sea floor to the surface, creating a shady tower of shelter for all kinds of fish, spiny lobsters, sea otters, sea lions, sometimes whales and even birds.

Kelp forests provide a habitat for important commercial species of fish such as black rockfish and kelp bass. The slightly slimy ocean vegetable also is used to make a number of human products including shampoo, toothpaste, pharmaceuticals and food.

Scientists knew early on that the nuclear power plant's cooling system would stir up the ocean and degrade nearby kelp beds. They also knew it would vacuum up small fish. However, it took them years of study and collaboration to determine the full effects, design a plan to compensate for that loss, and tailor the plan for the desired results.

The Wheeler North Reef project met its required performance standards for things such as kelp growth and fish production for the first time during the past three years, according to the California Coastal Commission. Now the reef just needs to keep up the good work for another 27 years.

The nuclear power plant, often called SONGS, shut down in 2013 after defects were found in its replacement steam generators. The commission requires the plant's operator, Southern California Edison, to assure that the reef continues its contributions to sea life for as long as the plant operated, a total of 32 years.

""It's great to see this work moving forward ... to meet these restoration goals within these habitats,"" said Commissioner Justin Cummings at this month's Coastal Commission meeting.

The reef is named for Wheeler J. North, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the California Institute of Technology. North, who died in 2002, was noted for his studies of California's coastal kelp forests.

His namesake reef is north of the power plant, a half-mile offshore and from 38 feet to 50 feet deep, extending 2.5 miles from San Mateo Point to the San Clemente Pier. It's built entirely of rock mined from a quarry and pushed off a barge into the ocean.

As a result of the reef's recent success, this month the commission unanimously approved a program to reduce monitoring, which will save the utility time and money. Instead of monitoring a total of 233 locations across the reef, the utility will be required to check only 166 locations beginning this year.

""A lot of time and effort went into determining what the reduction would look like,"" said Commission Executive Director Kate Huckelbridge. ""Time and cost were factors ... but also that we would still have confidence in the results.""

A representative of the Surfrider Foundation said that perhaps it is too soon to scale back oversight.

""This reef failed to meet performance standards for over 10 years,"" said Mandy Sackett, senior California policy manager for the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation.

""As of 2018, it had never met the standing fish stock requirement, despite the plant being in operation for decades,"" she said.

""We are grateful to see that the recent reef expansion has significantly increased the amount of times that the reef has met performance requirements, yet we feel strongly that the decades of insufficient performance would indicate a need for continued monitoring at the original frequency, at least in regard to fish stock assessments,"" Sackett said.

Commission officials said they are confident that the reduced monitoring will be adequate and that it will be returned to former levels if any problems are found.

""There is a lot of confidence that the reduced monitoring is going to be adequate to meet the permit conditions,"" said Dan Reed, a research biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Marine Research Institute.

UCSB's Marine Research Institute is employed as the reef's independent observer by the Coastal Commission with funding from Edison. Reed has been working on the project since 1993.

Construction of the reef was required by the California Coastal Commission in 1991 to offset the power plant's effects on the marine environment. The commission also mandated the installation of additional barriers on the plant's cooling system to reduce the amount of fish killed by the plant's cooling system and the restoration of 150 acres of Southern California wetlands.

Scientists found that as much as 65 tons of small fish and other sea life were killed every year when they were pulled into the cooling system's 18-foot-wide underwater intakes. The plant used 2.4 billion gallons of seawater daily to cool its steam generators.

Also, when the warm water was returned to the ocean, even though it exited through many holes in a long outlet pipe, the resulting current stirred up sediment and clouded the water. The silt covered and killed marine plants and bottom-dwelling creatures.

In its heyday, San Onofre produced electricity consumed across Southern California, including 20 percent of the juice used by San Diego Gas & Electric Company customers.

SDG&E ratepayers also took on a 20 percent share of the costs of building the power plant, its mitigation projects including the reef and the restoration of the San Dieguito Lagoon in Del Mar, and now the ongoing demolition of the defunct power plant.

Another ongoing cost to ratepayers and taxpayers is the expense of storing spent nuclear fuel at San Onofre. All of the fuel used since the 1980s remains on the site, packed into dry casks and parked at the edge of the ocean.

Initially, the Coastal Commission required a 150-acre reef to be built of low-lying boulders in the ocean north of the power plant near San Clemente.

First, plant operator Southern California Edison built a 23-acre experimental reef and monitored it for five years, Then, based on the results obtained from the experimental reef, Edison completed an additional 152 acres of reef in 2008.

However, the larger reef failed to produce the expected amount of fish, based on estimates of fish populations before the plant was built and compared to two similar natural reefs nearby. As a result, the commission required Edison to build an additional 193 acres, creating what Edison and the State Lands Commission say at a total of 373 acres in all is the largest artificial reef in the world.

Completion of the reef expansion in 2021 finally brought the thriving seaweed beds and fish families that the commission had been seeking for 30 years.

Divers collect data from specific locations, known as transects, to monitor the reef's production. That data is compared to data for two natural reefs nearby in the region, but outside the influence of the power plant.

Each transect measures 3 meters wide, 15 meters long, and 1.5 meters up from the bottom. Initially, the transects were marked with cables anchored into the rock, but today divers use GPS coordinates to find them.

""We dive a lot,"" said Reed, of the Marine Research Institute, in a recent telephone interview.

Two boats with six to eight divers visit the reef for about four days a week from the end of May through the end of October every year, he said.

""We basically just count fish and kelp, for the most part,"" he said. However, some of the information needed requires the divers to collect the fish, mainly samples of five key species, and take them to a lab to be autopsied.

Studies of the samples' guts, gonads and eggs help determine how much the fish eat and reproduce. A close look their ears determines age.

""The growth rate can be seen in ear rings, which add a layer of bone each year, much like tree rings,"" Reed said.

With the information collected the past three years, along with the previous cumulative results, the reef has met its production standards for a total of five years, according to the commission. Now it needs 27 additional years of continued satisfactory marine life production to meet the commission's requirement.

After the results are achieved, the reef probably will remain in place, Reed said. No further monitoring will be required under Edison's permit from the commission.

""To me, it's a success,"" he said. ""We get giant seabass through there ... weighing 400 to 500 pounds, white sharks. It's a functioning reef.""

The area is completely open to the public, he said. During lobster season, it's one of the most popular spots for lobster fishing along the Southern California coast.

Well beneath the waves, the reef is only affected by the underwater tidal surge and currents. The rocks were placed in an area of relatively shallow sand supported by a hard substrate, so the reef is unlikely to sink into the ocean bottom. Sometimes ocean currents cover small areas with sand, but they also uncover other areas.

Edison does a sonar survey every five years to measure the actual coverage of the reef, Reed said.

""It's really about what it was when we put it in,"" he said. ""It hasn't changed much at all.""

The revised monitoring program should significantly reduce the time needed for diving and lab work, he said. The team will continue to report the reef's status annually to the commission.",sandiegouniontribune.com,news,San Diego Union-Tribune,,0.05882352941176472,448917124,12,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1015a01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/960x540+0+100/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fa4%2Fa3d788c945989de04c46c7a5fe1f%2Fsampling-photoshoot-1.jpg,

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

A robust crypto mining industry has also made it the world's foremost Bitcoin hashrate producer by the same metric.

Jakobsdóttir, speaking to the Financial Times, outlined a goal of increased food production for the country alongside a transfer of renewable energy away from the crypto mining industry and towards's Iceland's households and other industries.

In Maine the National Weather Service warned of a treacherous travel day with an increase in ice forming inland from the coast, on top of snow or sleet that has already fallen.

Farther inland forecasters are calling for anywhere from one to two feet of snow across the mountains in western Maine and areas north and in New Hampshire's White Mountains, according to Maura Casey, a lead forecaster for the weather service, based out of Gray Maine.

In the lakes region of New Hampshire up to Maine totals are expected to be somewhat lower at six inches up to a foot with sleet and freezing rain mixing in.

""There's a pretty steep cut off with lower amounts near the coast and higher amounts in the mountains,"" Casey said.

Across Connecticut, New York City, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts the storm is expected to remain largely a rain event, with some freezing precipitation in the earlier part of the day in western and central Massachusetts before turning to all rain.

The heaviest rain is expected in the late afternoon and evening spreading across Connecticut and western and central Massachusetts from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and across Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. The rain could linger over Cape Cod and Nantucket until midnight.

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,

New York Attorney General Letitia James has said she is prepared to seek to seize some of Trump's assets, though it isn't clear how quickly that might unfold. Her office has declined to comment on its plans.

""Here's the concern: As they pursue these properties and if they start seizing properties next week, then, ultimately, I think that is only going to make President Trump more politically powerful,"" Whitaker said Saturday during an appearance on Newsmax's ""Saturday Report.""

Whitaker said James ""should just wait until this case runs its course through the appeals court, whether the Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines or not is applicable, whether due process has been met in this case, and whether you know Judge [Arthur] Engeron has a bias that should have disqualified him from the case. All of those should be decided before she starts seizing properties.""

The cases against Trump are ""election interference,"" a desire to keep Trump in court and off the campaign trail, added Whitaker.

""I just think ultimately it fails,"" he said.

Trump on Friday said he has nearly a half-billion dollars in cash but that he prefers to spend it on his presidential run rather than on the $454 million judgment against him in New York. He said he would fight the verdict ""all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.""

""Overnight dry weather will give way to sunshine,"" said Frank Nocera, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. Despite the sun, Sunday is expected to be blustery with temperatures chillier than average for late March, he said.

Fans of skiing welcomed the snowfall.

At Loon Mountain, a ski resort in New Hampshire's White Mountains, skiers were looking forward to the between 12 and 20 inches of new snow the storm was expected to drop on top of a foot earlier this week.

""The storm is great. It's brought a lot of skiers out to the mountain today,"" said Kevin Bell, vice president of marketing for the resort. ""This could be the biggest snow we'll see all year. It sets us up for a really good spring. The more snow New England gets, the better for us.""

The storm should be completely out of the New England region by Sunday morning.

There is a threat of flooding across the region including in far southern New Hampshire where morning snow and sleet could clog storm drains for this afternoon's heavier rainfall, according to the weather service.

The rain could also produce flooded rivers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The weather service has also issued flood watches across the tri-state area of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, including the city's five boroughs.

In New York City a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until 2 a.m. Sunday, according to forecasters. The weather service warned motorists of slippery road conditions.

Widespread minor urban flooding and scattered flash flooding was predicted with possible wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. A winter storm warning was in place north of Albany, with more than a foot of snow expected over the Lake George region, the southern Adirondack Mountains and the southern Green Mountains.

In the West, a winter storm warning remained in effect until Sunday morning for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow and winds gusting in excess of 80 mph (128 kph) was possible on the highest mountain peaks, the weather service said.

About a foot (30 centimeters) of snow had fallen by Saturday morning north of Lake Tahoe, and about a half-foot (15 cm) at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort north of Yosemite National Park. A 91 mph wind gust (147 mph) was recorded at Mammoth Mountain south of the park near the California-Nevada line.

The National Weather Service in Sacramento said snow could fall at rates of up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) per hour on the Sierra's west slope west of Lake Tahoe, with up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow possible at elevations as low as 4,500 feet (1,372 meters).

The storm making its way through New England comes at the end of winter season in some areas of the Northeast, including Boston, that saw little snow and warmer temperatures.

The blast of snow and freezing rain came after parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin were issued winter weather advisories earlier in the week.

The spring follows a wild winter, with record heat in February allowing for golf in Wisconsin and outdoor food trucks in Minnesota.

In South Florida severe thunderstorms Friday night delayed departures at the Miami International Airport during the busy spring break season, suspended a popular electronic music festival and disrupted matches at a high-profile tennis tournament.

And in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, crews battling wildfires this week got an assist from rain.

""Without a doubt the rain is helping"" said Cory Swift, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry,
