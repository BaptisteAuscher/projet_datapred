If all goes according to plan, Transnet is set to open up its rail network to the private sector as early as April 2024 - a process that will unleash billions of rands from companies in upgrading the country's transport infrastructure.

Transnet has released a draft network statement, which details how the state-owned entity (SOE) plans to embrace the private sector as a partner for delivery in its rail network that spans 21,200km across the country. The statement will be gazetted in a few days for public consultation and comments before being finalised at the start of Transnet's next financial year, which begins on 1 April. Transnet plans to get trains operated by private sector players in the second half of the year, said the company's new group CEO, Michelle Phillips.

Transnet's partnership with private sector players was first mooted more than 10 years ago, but was revived in recent years by President Cyril Ramaphosa as part of a range of reforms to grow the economy. The difference now is that reforms at Transnet are urgent and the SOE needs the private sector, considering that it has a smothering debt load of R130-billion, which doesn't give it room to fix and upgrade its rail network on its own.

The logistics industry believes that Transnet has neglected the maintenance of its rail network over the past decade, and has estimated the maintenance backlog at R200-billion. By partnering with Transnet, private sector players will have to carry this cost, while also putting security measures in place to curb incidents of vandalism and theft of cables - which the SOE's draft network statement revealed reached crisis levels last year - on its rail network.

The dysfunctional rail system is throwing South Africa's economy deeper into the doldrums. Stellenbosch University's Dr Zane Simpson estimated that Transnet's inability to rail sufficient volumes of commodities (mainly coal and iron ore) to ports cost the economy R411-billion in 2022 and about R353-billion in 2023. This translates to about R1-billion a day in lost economic output.

Transnet's draft network statement takes forward the process of liberalising rail in South Africa, which has long been controlled by Transnet. The SOE sets the terms and conditions for how its customers and industry use and pay for its infrastructure to rail their goods to markets.

To liberalise rail, Transnet plans to sell rail slots on its network to third parties or private sector players, allowing them to introduce their electric locomotives, independently rail their goods to markets, and move traffic off-road and on to rail. This process will be managed by a newly established infrastructure manager office that has set general rules, deadlines, procedures and contractual arrangements for private sector players accessing Transnet's rail infrastructure.

Some industry players see the publication of Transnet's draft network statement as a positive move. James Holley, CEO of Traxtion, Africa's largest private rail operator, described it as a ""watershed moment and [the] government must be praised for taking another step in the right direction for rail reform in South Africa"".

""While we celebrate this progressive move, we are examining the draft statement to ensure that the conditions align with the implementation of rail reform as laid out in the National Rail Policy, adopted by Cabinet in 2022, the Freight Logistics Roadmap and the Private Sector Participation Framework, adopted by Cabinet in 2023,"" said Holley.

Traxtion emerged as a successful bidder in November 2022 during Transnet's initial process to auction rail slots in the Cape Corridor. However, Transnet cancelled the contract awarded to Traxtion, saying negotiations with the company to work out the mechanisms for its participation in the railway lines proved challenging.

The private sector largely snubbed Transnet's initial process to auction rail slots, for several reasons.

First, Transnet required that private sector players work with a two-year period for capital investments, which involves deploying electric locomotives on the rail routes. Such an initiative requires a capital investment period of at least five to 10 years, considering that locomotives cost about $4-million to acquire and take about 24 months to bring into South Africa.

Second, Transnet set a two-year lease or contract period for using the rail slots. Private sector players wanted more than two years, considering that they would be making large investments and buying equipment that could last for at least 30 years.

Transnet has now corrected this by offering rail slots for between three and five years. Daily Maverick understands that Traxtion is keen to participate in Transnet's new auction process.

A point of contention among private sector players is the tariffs they will pay to Transnet and the infrastructure manager once they are allowed to run trains. Some players believe that the tariffs cited in Transnet's draft network statement are too high.

In the long term, some private sector players believe that the government should consider cutting its operational railways in half - from 21,200km to between 10,000km and 12,000km. Holley said the reduction will allow Transnet to focus on fixing a much smaller rail network and ""doing more with less"".

The Freight Logistics Roadmap supports Holley's view, as it talks about right-sizing and closing ""low-density"" iron ore and coal railway lines.

Last Saturday, while the top 20 anglers competed on Lay Lake at Major League Fishing's (MLF) Bass Pro Shops Redcrest 2024 Powered by Optima Lithium, the MLF Fisheries Management Division, MLF staff, Bass Pro Tour anglers Gary Klein and Grae Buck, and Alabama Power staff kicked off the Renew Our Rivers - Lake Logan Martin (Coosa River) weeklong clean up.

Alabama Power's Environmental Affairs Specialist Mike Clelland captained their cleanup barge to secluded areas of the lake with angler volunteers while the MLF staff and FMD led the clean up on the shoreline of Pell City Lakeside Park.

""It's outstanding to see the effort this community puts into keeping their lake beautiful, and I'm humbled to be a small part of this kick-off event"" said Bass Pro Tour angler Grae Buck.

At the end of the morning, the cleanup teams met and offloaded the barge full of trash at the city dumpsters that were provided for the week-long event.

Then, after the Redcrest championship event wrapped up last Sunday night, the MLF FMD was rback to work on Monday morning.

The FMD, MLF staff, Klein, Alabama Power Environmental Affairs employees, and volunteers built and deployed artificial fish habitat into Lake Logan Martin from Lakeside Park in Pell City at the Minn Kota Habitat Restoration Project Supported by KVD Foundation and MossBack Fish Habitat.

A Redcrest tradition with Minn Kota, the KVD Foundation, and MossBack Fish Habitat, the MLF FMD provides the host community with a habitat restoration project following MLF's most prestigious event. The project started with a donation of $5,000 from the KVD Foundation, which was then matched by MossBack Fish Habitat.

The two groups combined to provide Alabama Power with $10,000 in artificial habitat product. Before the habitat hit the water it was on display all weekend long at the MLF Outdoors Sports Expo for fans to see in the Minn Kota MossBack Fish Habitat Experience booth.

The habitat was weighed down using anchoring materials supplied by Lowe's in Leeds. The products were deployed using two habitat barges owned and operated by Alabama Power.

""We are extremely proud to provide our third consecutive year of support with the KVD Foundation at REDCREST and showcase Minn Kota's continual commitment to the bass fishing community and habitat restoration,"" said Kevin VanDam.

The 15.8-kilometer Go Cong sea dyke plays a crucial role in safeguarding the lives, State assets and about 600,000 households. It also protects nearly 54,000ha of natural land, including 43,000ha of agricultural land in coastal areas in Tien Giang province.

With 9 km already completed, PM Chinh urged the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Planning and Investment to collaborate with relevant authorities and Tien Giang province to finalise project details and secure funding, potentially from reserve sources, to expedite its completion.

About the planned construction of a seaport and Go Cong coastal restoration area, he noted that it should align with the master planning schemes of the province, the Mekong Delta and national seaports. He also advocated for a public-private partnership model for its development.

Visiting the construction site of the Rach Mieu 2 bridge, the second major bridge connecting Tien Giang and Ben Tre provinces across the Tien river, the leader asked the investor and contractors to step up and complete its construction three months ahead of schedule, by the National Day (September 2) in 2025.

The bridge has a length of nearly 17.6km and a width of 21.5m, with four lanes and a design speed of 80km per hour. Its total investment is over VND6.8 trillion (US$283.3 million) sourced from the State budget, with construction commencing in March 2022.

In the afternoon of the same day, PM Chinh and his entourage offered incense in tribute to national hero Truong Dinh at his temple in Go Cong Dong district.

This is despite a concoction of higher commodity prices, logistical constraints in SA and persistent supply challenges presenting challenges for the group in 2023.

""The company believes that the best approach for growth in our industrial business is to consider promising acquisition opportunities while progressing potential organic growth opportunities in our existing transition metals portfolio,"" group chair Kalidas Madhavpeddi said in the company's most recent annual report.

Glencore has in recent years modified its portfolio towards commodities that are essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy and global energy needs as society pushes for a sustainable future.

Glencore's exposure to assets that produce fossil fuels relates mainly to its coal mining operations in Australia, SA and Colombia and its Astron oil refining asset in SA.

The group said it was increasingly confident of its strategy as energy transition commodities such as copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, vanadium and aluminium have been touted to become substantially more important given their roles in the technologies and infrastructure that underpin low- or no-carbon energy sources.

Glencore has thus been investing in transition commodities, including its South American copper assets and projects, its African copper and cobalt operations, the Kazakhstan polymetallic and Brazilian bauxite and alumina investments alongside its Canadian INO nickel life-extension projects.

""We acquired a 30% equity stake in the Alunorte alumina operation in Brazil alongside a 45% equity stake in Mineracão Rio do Norte."" said Madhavpeddi. ""Further, we continued our efforts to develop a leading pipeline of development opportunities in copper, acquiring the remaining interest in the Mara brownfield copper project in Argentina, as well as the balance of the shares in PolyMet.""

Multiyear reset

In copper, Glencore acquired the remaining 56.25% interest in the Mara project that it did not already own, as well as the balance of PolyMet shares, about 18%.

CEO Gary Nagle said these copper acquisitions complemented the multiyear reset of Glencore's copper business unit to prepare it for growth.

""We have disposed of noncore assets and sought to align around large, long-life, low-cost resources in key copper-producing regions,"" said Nagle. ""Crucially, our copper portfolio offers capital-efficient growth possibilities, with most of our copper projects leveraging existing infrastructure.""

Glencore said that in 2023 SA exports through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal were affected by rail performance. However, transporting additional volumes by truck to ports helped shore up overall annual exports from SA by 5%.

The group stated that coal production of 113.6-million tonnes was 3% higher than in 2022, reflecting higher productivity in SA and a year-on-year easing in certain external factors that constrained capacity, such as wet weather and blockades.

Demand

Nagle said that while investing in its transition metals portfolio, Glencore believed that the likely scale and pace of global mine project development required in certain minerals would ultimately struggle to meet the commodity demand that the transition was expected to generate.

However, he said Glencore was well placed to participate in ""bridging this gap in supply"" through the flexibility that exists in the business to respond to global needs, while the expected interest rate cuts would ease the pressure.

""The strength of our diversified business model across industrial and marketing, focusing on metals and energy, has proved itself adept in a range of market conditions, giving us a solid foundation to successfully navigate the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as meet the resource needs of the future,"" he said.

""Though the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, global economic growth is forecast to bottom out in 2024. Expected interest rate cuts and corresponding restocking along the supply chain are likely to bring an improvement in demand conditions in Western markets later in the year,"" said Nagle.

As part of the regulatory approval process relating to the 2019 acquisition of a 75% shareholding in Astron Energy, Glencore and Astron Energy entered into certain commitments with the Competition Tribunal and the economic development department.

These commitments included investment expenditure of as much as R6.5bn until 2024 to ease congestion and improve the performance of the Cape Town oil refinery, contribute to the rebranding of certain retail sites and establish a development fund to support small and black-owned businesses in Astron Energy's value chain.

In November Glencore announced it had acquired a 77% effective interest in the entirety of Teck's steelmaking coal business, Elk Valley Resources (EVR), for $6.93bn cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to a normalised level of working capital.

On completion, the announced acquisition of EVR should lift Glencore's steelmaking coal production to about 30-million tonnes a year.

Madhavpeddi said the acquisition unlocked the potential, subject to shareholder approval, for a value-accretive demerger of its combined coal and carbon steel materials business.

""We will undertake a consultation process after the close of the transaction to assess shareholder views,"" he added.

Glencore said it could demerge the combined company only once it had sufficiently deleveraged towards a revised $5bn net debt cap, adding that this was expected to occur within 24 months from close.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at $680m (€626m).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

This discrepancy has hindered the proper execution of transactions within these pools. As a result, RippleX has advised its users against depositing new funds into these AMM pools until the issue is resolved.

The engineering team at RippleX is actively working alongside community participants to address the problem. The company has pledged to provide timely updates to the community as the situation progresses.

The AMM pools, which recently went live on the XRP Ledger main net, represent a significant milestone for the platform.

David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, emphasized the importance of this development, characterizing it as the commencement of a ""longer road"" toward future milestones.

According to Schwartz, the introduction of the AMM feature holds immense potential for the XRP Ledger, as it promises to broaden the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and attract more liquidity.

Schwartz's remarks underscore the strategic importance of AMM pools in positioning the XRP Ledger as a competitive player in the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance.

By embracing this pioneering feature, the XRP Ledger asserts its relevance and adaptability in catering to the burgeoning demands of users worldwide.

With the potential to attract more liquidity and broaden the scope of financial applications, AMM pools position the XRP Ledger as a key player in the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance, paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible financial system.

By facilitating seamless asset exchanges and providing liquidity in a decentralized manner, AMM pools offer a mechanism for users to engage in various financial activities, including trading and yield farming, with enhanced efficiency and reduced friction.

As the XRP Ledger embarks on this momentous journey, Schwartz's call to action resonates strongly -- inviting stakeholders to embrace the possibilities while acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead.

The AMM model implemented on the XRP Ledger eliminates the need for traditional order books by establishing liquidity pools that determine asset prices based on specific algorithms.

Notable features of the AMM on XRPL include aggregated liquidity, continuous action mechanism, and single-sided liquidity provision.

In a recent blog post, David Schwartz outlined numerous use cases for the AMM feature, ranging from financial applications like trading and yield farming to non-financial scenarios such as seamless asset swaps.

However, Schwartz also cautioned users about the novelty and complexity of transactions within the AMM pools, encouraging them to submit bug reports and offer suggestions to enhance the platform's functionality.

Despite encountering technical challenges, the introduction of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger represents a significant step forward in the platform's evolution.

As RippleX works diligently to address the current issues, users are advised to exercise caution and refrain from depositing additional funds into AMM pools until the discrepancies are resolved.

RippleX continues to work towards ensuring the seamless operation of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger, users can expect further updates and improvements to be implemented.

This ongoing effort underscores Ripple's commitment to innovation and its vision of creating a robust and inclusive financial ecosystem powered by blockchain technology.

Moving forward, the successful resolution of these technical issues will not only enhance the functionality of the XRP Ledger but also contribute to the growth of the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Stay tuned for further updates from RippleX as they work towards ensuring the smooth operation of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1764705882352942,448988758,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9417934

The incident occurred during the second quarter of the game, with Green and Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane receiving technical fouls for their involvement.

""And then Taylor Jenkins took a dive... And Taylor Jenkins milked it. And I could not believe that he milked it like that and he's laying on the court milking it and their trainer comes up to him and one of our players.""

""He's walking back to our bench and the trainer asks Taylor Jenkins if he's ok and he's like 'I'm ok, I'm ok,' like trying to milk it.""

""And that to me is absolutely insane. I told you all it would be players trying stuff and I know they were trying to get me kicked out of the game...but a coach taking a dive and then milking it is crazy."" (5:35)

On his podcast, The Draymond Green Show, Green expressed disbelief at Jenkins' actions, claiming that the Grizzlies coach ""milked"" the fall and attempted to make the incident appear worse than it was. Green's remarks shed light on the intensity of the rivalry between the two teams, with tensions boiling over on the court.

During the skirmish, which began with a physical confrontation between Green and Grizzlies forward Santi Aldama, Jenkins ended up on the floor after being pushed by players involved in the scuffle. In the aftermath, Green didn't mince words, criticizing Jenkins for what he perceived as an attempt to exaggerate the situation.

Despite the altercation, neither Green nor Bane faced further disciplinary action from the league. However, Green's comments suggest that there may still be lingering animosity between the two Western Conference rivals.

The incident adds another chapter to the ongoing rivalry between the Warriors and the Grizzlies, with both teams known for their competitive spirit and physical style of play. As the Warriors continue to push for a playoff spot in the highly competitive Western Conference, maintaining composure and avoiding unnecessary confrontations will be crucial for Green and his teammates.

Ultimately, Green's accusation highlights the passion and intensity that define NBA matchups, with emotions often running high on the court. While confrontations are not uncommon in professional basketball, maintaining professionalism and focusing on the game's outcome should always remain a top priority for players and coaches alike.

The Warriors Can Be Out Of Play-In Spots In The Next 3 Games

The Golden State Warriors are facing a critical stretch of games that could potentially see them drop out of the play-in spots in the Western Conference standings. Over the next three matchups, they are set to go head-to-head against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Miami Heat, and Orlando Magic, all formidable opponents in their own right.

Sitting in 10th place with a record of 36-33, the Warriors are precariously holding onto their position in the standings. However, the surging Houston Rockets, who have won 8 consecutive games, are hot on their heels with a record of 35-35. With just a game and a half separating the two teams, any misstep by the Warriors could see them overtaken by the Rockets.

The upcoming games against the Timberwolves, Heat, and Magic present a daunting challenge for the Warriors, as all three teams are in good form and will be looking to secure victories of their own. The Timberwolves, currently vying for playoff positioning, will provide a tough test with their dynamic roster led by Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards. Meanwhile, the Heat and Magic have shown resilience throughout the season.

For the Warriors to maintain their position in the standings, they will need to put forth exceptional performances in each of these matchups. With the Rockets gaining momentum behind them, dropping even two of these games could spell trouble for Golden State. It's imperative that the Warriors remain focused and determined, understanding the significance of each game as they aim to secure a spot in the play-in tournament and ultimately make a push for the playoffs.

If The Warriors Miss The Playoffs, Is This The End Of Their Big 3

If the Golden State Warriors fail to make the playoffs this season, it could indeed mark the end of an era for their renowned Big 3 of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Joe Lacob, the team's owner, will face significant decisions regarding the future direction of the franchise.

For the past decade, the Warriors have been the epitome of dominance in the NBA, capturing four championships and appearing in six NBA Finals. However, the current season has seen the team struggle to replicate its past success, hovering around the .500 mark and facing the possibility of missing the playoffs altogether.

Lacob and the Warriors organization have made it clear that significant changes will be necessary if the team fails to meet expectations this season. With the core of their roster aging and facing injury challenges, there may be a need to rebuild and transition to a new era of Warriors basketball.

However, if the Warriors manage to secure a playoff berth, even through the play-in tournament, and make a respectable postseason run, it could provide a glimmer of hope for the continuation of their illustrious era. A deep playoff run could demonstrate that the core group of Curry, Thompson, and Green still has what it takes to compete at the highest level, albeit with some necessary adjustments to the supporting cast.

Ultimately, the fate of the Big 3 and the future trajectory of the Warriors will depend on their performance in the remainder of the season and the playoffs. While missing the playoffs could signal the end of an era, a successful postseason campaign could offer a chance for the Warriors to extend their competitive window and prolong the legacy of their iconic trio.

Here's what that could mean for your garden,"With the arrival of spring in North America, many people are gravitating to the gardening and landscaping section of home improvement stores, where displays are overstocked with eye-catching seed packs and benches are filled with potted annuals and perennials.

But some plants that once thrived in your yard may not flourish there now. To understand why, look to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent update of its plant hardiness zone map, which has long helped gardeners and growers figure out which plants are most likely to thrive in a given location.

Comparing the 2023 map to the previous version from 2012 clearly shows that as climate change warms the Earth, plant hardiness zones are shifting northward. On average, the coldest days of winter in our current climate, based on temperature records from 1991 through 2020, are 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) warmer than they were between 1976 and 2005.

In some areas, including the central Appalachians, northern New England and north central Idaho, winter temperatures have warmed by 1.5 hardiness zones -- 15 degrees F (8.3 C) -- over the same 30-year window. This warming changes the zones in which plants, whether annual or perennial, will ultimately succeed in a climate on the move.

As a plant pathologist, I have devoted my career to understanding and addressing plant health issues. Many stresses not only shorten the lives of plants, but also affect their growth and productivity.

I am also a gardener who has seen firsthand how warming temperatures, pests and disease affect my annual harvest. By understanding climate change impacts on plant communities, you can help your garden reach its full potential in a warming world.

There's no question that the temperature trend is upward. From 2014 through 2023, the world experienced the 10 hottest summers ever recorded in 174 years of climate data. Just a few months of sweltering, unrelenting heat can significantly affect plant health, especially cool-season garden crops like broccoli, carrots, radishes and kale.

Winters are also warming, and this matters for plants. The USDA defines plant hardiness zones based on the coldest average annual temperature in winter at a given location. Each zone represents a 10-degree F range, with zones numbered from 1 (coldest) to 13 (warmest). Zones are divided into 5-degree F half zones, which are lettered ""a"" (northern) or ""b"" (southern).

For example, the coldest hardiness zone in the lower 48 states on the new map, 3a, covers small pockets in the northernmost parts of Minnesota and has winter extreme temperatures of -40 F to -35 F. The warmest zone, 11b, is in Key West, Florida, where the coldest annual lows range from 45 F to 50 F.

On the 2012 map, northern Minnesota had a much more extensive and continuous zone 3a. North Dakota also had areas designated in this same zone, but those regions now have shifted completely into Canada. Zone 10b once covered the southern tip of mainland Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but has now been pushed northward by a rapidly encroaching zone 11a.

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant:

Hardiness zones matter far less for annual plants, which germinate, flower and die in a single growing season, than for perennial plants that last for several years. Annuals typically avoid the lethal winter temperatures that define plant hardiness zones.

In fact, most annual seed packs don't even list the plants' hardiness zones. Instead, they provide sowing date guidelines by geographic region. It's still important to follow those dates, which help ensure that frost-tender crops are not planted too early and that cool-season crops are not harvested too late in the year.

Many perennials can grow across wide temperature ranges. For example, hardy fig and hardy kiwifruit grow well in zones 4-8, an area that includes most of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states. Raspberries are hardy in zones 3-9, and blackberries are hardy in zones 5-9. This eliminates a lot of guesswork for most gardeners, since a majority of U.S. states are dominated by two or more of these zones.

Nevertheless, it's important to pay attention to plant tags to avoid selecting a variety or cultivar with a restricted hardiness zone over another with greater flexibility. Also, pay attention to instructions about proper sun exposure and planting dates after the last frost in your area.

Fruit trees have two parts, the rootstock and the scion wood, that are grafted together to form a single tree. Rootstocks, which consist mainly of a root system, determine the tree's size, timing of flowering and tolerance of soil-dwelling pests and pathogens. Scion wood, which supports the flowers and fruit, determines the fruit variety.

Most commercially available fruit trees can tolerate a wide range of hardiness zones. However, stone fruits like peaches, plums and cherries are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations within those zones -- particularly abrupt swings in winter temperatures that create unpredictable freeze-thaw events.

These seesaw weather episodes affect all types of fruit trees, but stone fruits appear to be more susceptible, possibly because they flower earlier in spring, have fewer hardy rootstock options, or have bark characteristics that make them more vulnerable to winter injury.

Perennial plants' hardiness increases through the seasons in a process called hardening off, which conditions them for harsher temperatures, moisture loss in sun and wind, and full sun exposure. But a too-sudden autumn temperature drop can cause plants to die back in winter, an event known as winter kill. Similarly, a sudden spring temperature spike can lead to premature flowering and subsequent frost kill.

Plants aren't the only organisms constrained by temperature. With milder winters, southern insect pests and plant pathogens are expanding their ranges northward.

One example is Southern blight, a stem and root rot disease that affects 500 plant species and is caused by a fungus, Agroathelia rolfsii. It's often thought of as affecting hot Southern gardens, but has become more commonplace recently in the Northeast U.S. on tomatoes, pumpkins and squash, and other crops, including apples in Pennsylvania.

Other plant pathogens may take advantage of milder winter temperatures, which leads to prolonged saturation of soils instead of freezing. Both plants and microbes are less active when soil is frozen, but in wet soil, microbes have an opportunity to colonize dormant perennial plant roots, leading to more disease.

It can be challenging to accept that climate change is stressing some of your garden favorites, but there are thousands of varieties of plants to suit both your interests and your hardiness zone. Growing plants is an opportunity to admire their flexibility and the features that enable many of them to thrive in a world of change.",phys.org,news,Phys.org,,0.2941176470588236,448988471,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/climate-change-is-shif.jpg,

The workshop particularly focused on how to remain resilient to changing weather conditions. Caribbean countries were encouraged to develop methods for dealing with changing climatic conditions.

David Farell, Principal of the Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, recently addressed a regional workshop regarding climate change. The theme of the event was ""National Frameworks for Climate Services in the Caribbean"".

The event held at Accra Beach Resort was concerned with the dynamics of climate change. The workshop particularly focused on how to remain resilient to changing weather conditions. Caribbean countries were encouraged to develop methods for dealing with changing climatic conditions.

Developing climate resilience is the need of the hour, as it means developing methods that can help us sustain various aspects of life, such as agriculture, despite climate changes.

David Farrell outlined the importance of collaborating with the government, NGOs, and other climate enthusiasts to aid preparation for natural disasters. Although talks about the national framework for climate change started over a decade ago, there is plenty of work to be done.

Principal Farrell expressed his appreciation for what has been achieved so far. However, he also showed concerns for not being further in the process of implementation of climate services in the region.

He stressed that they need to take more measures nationally. This will help build resilience to climate variability in countries all across the region. He appealed for collaboration with financial sector to help with challenges caused by drought in Panama Canal.

Furthermore, he emphasized the need to develop national-level solutions for the concern as this will reduce dependency on CIMH. He suggested studying the economic structures and building services in accordance with the same.

This workshop was of utmost importance as Dr Van Meerback predicted Caribbean countries are expecting hotter temperatures this coming summer. The CIMH climatologist also expects more severe hurricanes and tropical cyclones. UN weather agency has issued a Red Alert on climate change as ice melt has increased in 2023.

The process of buying a home has seemingly never been simpler: Find a property on a listings website like Zillow, Redfin or Trulia; reach out to the listing agent; tour the property; and make an offer.

But for years behind the scenes, experts say, consumers have not been fully aware of the ultimate cost -- and potential conflicts of interest -- when searching for a home.

Now, a landmark settlement with the National Association of Realtors is poised to upend this model. According to consumer advocates, and even some Realtors, it's a win for homebuyers and sellers.

""Price transparency is a good thing, increased competition is a good thing, and this will increase both,"" said Mariya Letdin, an associate professor at Florida State University's College of Business. ""I really welcome this change.""

When someone goes looking for a home today, they are in most cases intercepted by a broker who has access to certain listings and who will work with the buyer at no cost upfront to help them get into a home.

But therein lies a common misconception, experts interviewed by NBC News said. Although a homeowner who puts their property up for sale must hire professionals to market their home, they usually fold that cost into the final price paid by the buyer.

""The buyer brings the entire purchase price to the table,"" Letdin said. ""And the seller gets to keep a little bit more of that after this ruling.""

As part of the new settlement, the buyer should now be fully apprised upfront about any potential fees or commissions they'll ultimately have to pay.

That's because the agreement requires that a buyer sign a formal contract with a broker laying out what services they'll be receiving, and for how much.

Alternatively, a homebuyer could decide not to hire a broker and instead put their search costs toward a real estate lawyer, appraiser or someone else with knowledge of the housing market, experts say.

And a seller could even offer to cover the cost of the buyer's team as an incentive to attract more buyers.

Of course, for a property that's garnering a lot of attention, such buyer incentives are unlikely to be on the table.

And in the months following Covid-19 pandemic reopenings, the hottest U.S. real estate markets were tipped squarely in favor of sellers.

But now, with home price growth leveling off, the playing field is leveling out too, putting more buyers in the driver's seat, experts say.

""Now you can hire an attorney for $1,500, instead of paying a $50,000 commission,"" said Doug Miller, a real estate lawyer based in Minnesota who helped launch the actions that led to the NAR settlement.

Whomever a prospective buyer chooses as their representative in the homebuying process, the NAR settlement now formally bans the seller's ability to advertise a commission for the buyer's reps on the multiple listing service.

For its part, the NAR has maintained that the free market has always set commission levels, and that they were always negotiable -- and even useful.

""Offers of compensation help make professional representation more accessible, decrease costs for home buyers to secure these services, increase fair housing opportunities, and increase the potential buyer pool for sellers,"" the NAR said in its March 15 statement announcing the agreement.

But in most cases, there was little difference in the amount being offered for those commissions in a given market -- usually about 3%.

That's because any attempt to offer a lower commission to a buyer's agent would likely motivate the agent to direct their client away from that property.

Miller characterized that behavior as improper and said buyers, in many cases, would have had no awareness of it.

""The future here is that buyers will now be in the driver's seat,"" Miller said. ""Instead of that [commission] money going to their agent ... it can now go directly to the buyer. It's the same amount of money, but now the buyer gets money instead of a buyer agent, and they can decide what to do with it.""

What's more, greater competition for clients is likely to result in lower costs across the board, said Ryan Tomasello, a real estate industry analyst with the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods financial firm.

""When you introduce a ton of transparency to a marketplace that has historically lacked it, any economist will tell you that reduces friction costs -- i.e., commissions -- and those are some of the highest in the world,"" Tomasello said. ""So the all-in cost of buying and selling a home, in theory, is going to decline.""

Many experts, including other real estate professionals, agree that the settlement will effectively thin the ranks of fly-by-night agents who served as an intermediary -- a phenomenon that surged during the pandemic-era housing boom.

""A lot of folks parachuted in during 2020-2021 to try to make easy extra money by putting themselves out there as a buyer agent and taking 3%,"" said Phil Crescenzo Jr., vice president of the Southeast division at Nation One Mortgage Corp.

""But they weren't bringing 3% of value -- not even close.""

Crescenzo compared it to moonlighting mortgage brokers who helped fuel the housing bubble of the mid-to-late 2000s.

""Once they changed the compensation rules, the dominant professionals rose to the top, the bottom disappeared, and the industry got better,"" Crescenzo said.",cnbc.com,news,CNBC,Rob Wile,0.2705882352941176,448988099,1,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107361428-1705615422161-gettyimages-1935916858-AFP_34FP94Y.jpeg?v=1711291017&w=1920&h=1080,eng-9420431

The biggest individual reason, of course, is Jalen Green. Since losing Alperen Sengun to what could be a season-ending ankle injury on March 10, Green has been electric in a 5-0 stretch for Houston.

In those games, Green is averaging 34.4 points and 7.4 rebounds per game while shooting 56.5% from the field and 50.0% on 3-pointers. He's the reigning Western Conference Player of the Week, and the talented 22-year-old could be poised to win it again on Monday.

So, how did Green get to this point after head coach Ime Udoka hinted in mid-February that he might lose his starting spot?

In postgame comments after Saturday's win, Udoka credited Green for his resiliency and confidence. Among those comments:

He's on a hot streak, obviously. Just like people have slumps at times, people can go on runs like this. But the main thing is he's stayed resilient and continued to be confident when things weren't going great. And all it takes for a really good scorer is to see a few go through. Run off a game or two of hot shooting and it can kind of snowball like this.

I'm proud of the way he fought through some adversity. It's not easy with a newer team and some different demands from a coaching staff and doing different things to always stay the course and fight through it. And he's done that. Great to see him come out on the other side.

Green and the Rockets will look to build on that momentum in Monday's home game versus Portland, and Udoka appears hopeful.

""I've coached a lot of high-level scorers,"" Udoka said of Green's ongoing hot streak.

This event enhances the original game and establishes a deep bond between the protagonist, Cloud, and the Seventh Infantry, a group of Shinra soldiers.

In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, players witness an unforgettable sequence as Cloud forms an unbreakable bond with members of the Seventh Infantry during the Junon parade. This expanded narrative enriches the gaming experience, infusing it with the remake's distinctive charm. Players are tasked with navigating Junon alongside their new squadron, each member lending support in battles while unwittingly aiding Cloud's escape from the city.

Following the game's release, fan enthusiasm for the Seventh Infantry soared, with Reddit user Minev1128 expressing adoration for the group on the Final Fantasy subreddit. Many echoed this sentiment, hoping for the Seventh Infantry's return in the upcoming sequel, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Part 3. Notably, the group's leader, affectionately dubbed ""Commander Waifu"" by fans, has garnered significant attention despite lacking an official name in the game.

A prevailing fan theory suggests that the Seventh Infantry could play a pivotal role in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Part 3 by assisting Cid, a skilled pilot, in operating the Highwind, the iconic airship of the series. With the sequel confirmed to feature an airship, speculation about the Seventh Infantry's involvement runs rife. Fans envision the group as essential crew members, facilitating Cloud and his companions' journey across Midgar.

The widespread acclaim and affection for the Seventh Infantry underscore the anticipation surrounding their potential return in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Part 3. While Square Enix has remained tight-lipped about the sequel's specifics, the sincere desire of fans suggests a strong likelihood of the group's reappearance. With the precedent set by previous character revivals in the series, enthusiasts remain hopeful for the Seventh Infantry's inclusion in the upcoming installment.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.388235294117647,448987853,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9413770

The Local Self-Government department has directed local bodies to begin pre-monsoon cleaning activities with early planning. Municipalities and grama panchayats can spend a maximum of ₹30,000 per ward, while corporations can spend ₹40,000 per ward for cleaning activities. The funds for these will be utilised from the Suchitwa Mission's allocation, the local body's own funds, and the National Health Mission allocation.

For areas which have been identified as hotspots for spread of vector-borne diseases in the past two years, the local body can spend an additional amount of up to ₹10,000 with approval from the council. The pre-monsoon clean-up activities which will begin in the last week of March has to be completed by May 20. Local bodies have been asked to ensure 100% door-step collection of waste, clearing up of drains and identification of areas of possible water-logging. Mosquito-source destruction activities will have to be carried out in institutions and in houses.

Waterbodies and canals in which waste has accumulated have to be cleaned over the next two months. Services of Kudumbashree volunteers, ASHA workers, Haritha Karma Sena workers, residents welfare association members, National Service Scheme volunteers and youth clubs can be used for clean-up as well as awareness campaigns. The various departments and missions, including the Haritha Keralam Mission, Suchitwa Mission and the Clean Kerala Company will co-ordinate in the clean-up activities.

List of waste dumps

The ward-level sanitation committees will have to prepare a list of waste dumps, areas prone to waterlogging and areas which are known to have prevalence of vector-borne diseases and submit it to the local body secretary before March 30. The health workers will have to identify houses and institutions which do not have any waste treatment facility and submit the list to the secretary. The secretary has to monitor the progress of the pre-monsoon clean-up activities once every two days.

Addressing a discussion on development document of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) here on Sunday, he said as an important city in Central Kerala region, development of Thrissur is very important.

""Entrepreneurship should be encouraged. Guruvayur-Thirunavaya railway line should be implemented fast. Guruvayur-Thrissur line should be doubled. Thrissur will be benefited by the proposed Nilambur-Nanjangud line.""

The existing roads are inadequate for the development of Thrissur, Mr. Sreedharan noted. New roads and elevated bypasses should come here. We need to plan projects with a vision for the next 50 years. The State cannot survive only on expatriate money. New industries and enterprises should come here. Infrastructure and power availability are necessary for that, Mr. Sreedharan added.

NDA candidate Suresh Gopi, who participated in the discussion, said he was not a full-time politician. I am interested only in what I can do for the country if I win the election, he said. BJP State vice-president C. Sadanandan presided over.

Russia is hoping to capitalise on Ukraine's growing shortage of air defence missiles that has opened up the skies for Russian missile attacks.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid, in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a note.

Since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have amounted to at least $11.5bn in losses for Ukraine, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Energy Svitlana Hrynchuk said on air on March 23.

The renewed campaign is the biggest since November 2023, when Russia started targeting Ukraine's power infrastructure and then launched a massive barrage of missile strikes in January this year designed to use up Ukraine's dwindling supplies of air defence missiles.

The massive Russian offensive started on March 21 and has left nearly 1.5mn Ukrainians without electricity. The Deputy Head of the Presidential Office, Oleksii Kuleba, reported the widespread outages following the barrage of over 150 drones and missiles targeting various cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine.

The eastern regions bore the brunt of the attacks, with Kharkiv and its neighbouring areas experiencing the most significant disruptions. As of late morning on the day of the attack, approximately 700,000 residents in those areas were plunged into darkness after power supplies failed.

Other affected regions included the Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Poltava Oblasts, with 250,000, 200,000 and 110,000 residents respectively facing power outages - the first blackouts in over a year. Until the current campaign, Ukraine's air defences have worked effectively, knocking out the bulk of inbound Russian missiles. But as supplies run low, Ukraine's air defences are increasingly incapable of preventing Russian missiles from reaching their targets, some of which are taking multiple hits in the same day. The Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Sumy and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts also reported disruptions.

Efforts to restore power commenced immediately, with the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo confirming by early afternoon on March 22 that electricity had been reinstated in all regions except for the Kharkiv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts.

""An emergency shutdown had to be implemented in the morning during the attack due to the largest mass attack on Ukraine's energy grid,"" Ukrenergo's head, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said as cited by Kyiv Independent.

Zaporizhzhia's Dnipro hydroelectric power plant (HPP), one of Ukraine's largest, lost about a third of its generation capacity after a Russian missile strike, the head of Ukrainian state-owned energy company Ukrhydroenergo, Ihor Syrota, told the Associated Press.

The strikes have resulted in casualties and considerable damage to energy facilities, including the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, which has been knocked out of action and is now in a ""critical condition"", according to its director. The plant suffered severe damage to one of its stations. Syrota highlighted the dire situation at the HPP, where two missiles inflicted significant damage on the hydroelectric power station-2 (HPS-2), jeopardising its operational capacity. ""So far, we are losing the station,"" Syrota lamented, noting that the adjacent dam had also sustained damage, albeit without immediate risk of a breach, the Kyiv Independent reports.

At least three fatalities and 26 injuries have been reported across the country due to the attacks. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko condemned the strikes on Facebook, saying: ""The enemy launched one of the largest attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent weeks,"" with the apparent aim of causing widespread disruption to the country's energy system.

As emergency services continue their efforts at the damaged sites, the full extent of the destruction and the potential for recovery remains uncertain. This attack marks a significant escalation in the targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, underscoring the ongoing challenges faced by the nation amidst the conflict.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been making desperate appeals to his Western allies for more air defence ammunition, but so far these appeals have gone unheeded.

According to a US military assessment published last November, Ukraine will run out of long-range missiles in the first two months of this year, air defence rockets in March and the crucial artillery shells that are the workhorse of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) by summer. So far the first two parts of that assessment have already come to pass, and the outlook for increased shell supplies from the West appears to be in doubt.

Russia may follow through on its advantage with a new offensive, according to experts. Russia is gathering 100,000-strong force, possibly for a summer offensive, Ukraine's Ground Forces Commander Oleksandr Pavliuk said on national television on March 22.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.3725490196078431,448987411,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Ukraine_industry_factory_energy_power_station_electricity_business_0_0.jpeg,eng-9416762

Garden centers hope would-be green thumbs stay interested,"NEW YORK -- Garden centers enjoyed a pandemic boom, particularly with millennials, as people looked for outdoor activities during lockdowns. Now the question is, will those wannabe green thumbs stick with the habit?

In 2022, 80% of U.S. households took part in lawn and gardening activities, a five-year high, according to the National Gardening Association's 2023 National Gardening Survey. Spending on lawn and gardening activities rose to an average of $616 per household in 2022, an increase of $74 from 2021.

Danny Summers, managing director of The Garden Center Group, which tracks sales of about 125 centers across the country, said sales are up by about 25% compared with 2019. But the sales totals flattened out between 2022 and 2023.

The spring season is crucial, because garden centers can make about 60% of sales during the 12 weeks of spring, according to Summers. That's particularly true for centers in the North since there are fewer months to plant.

To regain the sales momentum, garden centers must navigate a number of challenges as another spring season kicks in. Chief among them are volatile weather and higher costs for labor and plant materials, which in turn has forced the companies to raise prices for customers.

One positive development: Younger households, particularly the 18- to 34-year-old age group and 35- to 44-year old age group, have seen larger increases in spending than older households, a trend that Summers thinks has legs.

""Our garden centers are just serving a new need that we don't see going away anytime soon, because this new audience is very much grounded in nature and plants and gardening,"" he said.

At Flowercraft Garden Center, a San Francisco garden center that is in its 50th year of operation, houseplants, vegetable starter plants and citrus trees are selling well, said general manager Lydia Patubo.

Since the spring season is so short, garden centers are at the mercy of the weather. Patubo said last year's unprecedented storms in the area put a dent in business. San Francisco saw record rainfall of nearly 34 inches during the 2023 ""water year,"" which ended in September. That was good for an area suffering from a yearslong drought, but bad for garden center business.

""It was a rough year,"" Patubo said. ""So, I'm hoping (this year) for less rain, better business,"" she said.

As spring kicks into gear, Patubo said smaller items -- such as four-inch plants or six plants in a pack -- are selling better than bigger one gallon to 15-gallon plants because customers are spending less due to higher prices and inflation.

At the East Coast Garden Center in Millsboro, Delaware, co-owner Chris Cordrey said weather is also a concern, particularly because so much of the center's business is compressed into a four-month period between March and June.

""We got a lot of rain last year, so that made it difficult,"" he said. ""If you miss a Saturday during the busy time when it's raining or cold out, then that really hurts your sales overall.""

While according to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, 2023 was overall the third-driest year on record, parts of the country saw above average rainfall. Meanwhile, there were a record 28 separate weather and climate disasters in 2023 that caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, such as heat waves, drought, wildfires and floods, surpassing the record 22 the U.S. had in 2020. All of those can affect plants.

Higher costs are another issue.

""What we're used to paying labor has increased tremendously,"" Cordray said. He hasn't hired fewer workers, with a staff of 200, but he created a new recruitment position and added recruitment software to help retain staff.

To offset higher costs, he had to raise prices; for example, a flower in a one-gallon pot, a standard size, had sold between $5 and $5.50 but he had to raise that to between $6 and $6.50.

So far, customers are taking the price increases in stride. Container gardening with newer ""dwarf"" size plants and fruit trees and bushes like blueberries and raspberries are popular.

""People are enjoying growing their own food and then harvesting their food,"" he said.

At Ooltewah Nursery and Landscape Co. in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has been in business for 35 years, sales boomed during the pandemic and haven't slowed down since.

Vegetable and fruit plants are big sellers, including tomatoes and eggplants, general manager Kat McGraw said. Because of the garden center's location -- two hours from both Atlanta and Nashville -- a lot of retirees have relocated there, and they have time to spend on their gardens.

Still, weather has been a challenge there too, including last year's drought and deep freeze, not normal for the area. A lot of plants were damaged.

Like elsewhere, costs have risen across the board, including costs for delivery and trucking, potting soil and even the wind chimes found in the gift shop.

But that hasn't discouraged her customers from spending, she said. The mild climate in Tennessee, weather events aside, lets people garden eight or nine months out of the year.

""People are still putting a lot of time into their yards, they all want a nice yard, and that's where they spend a lot of their time,"" she said.

""We got a lot of rain last year, so that made it difficult,"" he said. ""If you miss a Saturday during the busy time when it's raining or cold out, then that really hurts your sales overall.""

While according to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, 2023 was overall the third-driest year on record, parts of the country saw above average rainfall. Meanwhile, there were a record 28 separate weather and climate disasters in 2023 that caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, such as heat waves, drought, wildfires and floods, surpassing the record 22 the U.S. had in 2020. All of those can affect plants.

Higher costs are another issue.

""What we're used to paying labor has increased tremendously,"" Cordray said. He hasn't hired fewer workers, with a staff of 200, but he created a new recruitment position and added recruitment software to help retain staff.

To offset higher costs, he had to raise prices; for example, a flower in a one-gallon pot, a standard size, had sold between $5 and $5.50 but he had to raise that to between $6 and $6.50.

So far, customers are taking the price increases in stride. Container gardening with newer ""dwarf"" size plants and fruit trees and bushes like blueberries and raspberries are popular.

""People are enjoying growing their own food and then harvesting their food,"" he said.

At Ooltewah Nursery and Landscape Co. in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has been in business for 35 years, sales boomed during the pandemic and haven't slowed down since.

Vegetable and fruit plants are big sellers, including tomatoes and eggplants, general manager Kat McGraw said. Because of the garden center's location -- two hours from both Atlanta and Nashville -- a lot of retirees have relocated there, and they have time to spend on their gardens.

Still, weather has been a challenge there too, including last year's drought and deep freeze, not normal for the area. A lot of plants were damaged.

Like elsewhere, costs have risen across the board, including costs for delivery and trucking, potting soil and even the wind chimes found in the gift shop.

But that hasn't discouraged her customers from spending, she said. The mild climate in Tennessee, weather events aside, lets people garden eight or nine months out of the year.

""People are still putting a lot of time into their yards, they all want a nice yard, and that's where they spend a lot of their time,"" she said.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

Garden centers hope would-be green thumbs stay interested,"NEW YORK -- Garden centers enjoyed a pandemic boom, particularly with millennials, as people looked for outdoor activities during lockdowns. Now the question is, will those wannabe green thumbs stick with the habit?

In 2022, 80% of U.S. households took part in lawn and gardening activities, a five-year high, according to the National Gardening Association's 2023 National Gardening Survey. Spending on lawn and gardening activities rose to an average of $616 per household in 2022, an increase of $74 from 2021.

Danny Summers, managing director of The Garden Center Group, which tracks sales of about 125 centers across the country, said sales are up by about 25% compared with 2019. But the sales totals flattened out between 2022 and 2023.

The spring season is crucial, because garden centers can make about 60% of sales during the 12 weeks of spring, according to Summers. That's particularly true for centers in the North since there are fewer months to plant.

To regain the sales momentum, garden centers must navigate a number of challenges as another spring season kicks in. Chief among them are volatile weather and higher costs for labor and plant materials, which in turn has forced the companies to raise prices for customers.

One positive development: Younger households, particularly the 18- to 34-year-old age group and 35- to 44-year old age group, have seen larger increases in spending than older households, a trend that Summers thinks has legs.

""Our garden centers are just serving a new need that we don't see going away anytime soon, because this new audience is very much grounded in nature and plants and gardening,"" he said.

At Flowercraft Garden Center, a San Francisco garden center that is in its 50th year of operation, houseplants, vegetable starter plants and citrus trees are selling well, said general manager Lydia Patubo.

Since the spring season is so short, garden centers are at the mercy of the weather. Patubo said last year's unprecedented storms in the area put a dent in business. San Francisco saw record rainfall of nearly 34 inches during the 2023 ""water year,"" which ended in September. That was good for an area suffering from a yearslong drought, but bad for garden center business.

""It was a rough year,"" Patubo said. ""So, I'm hoping (this year) for less rain, better business,"" she said.

As spring kicks into gear, Patubo said smaller items -- such as four-inch plants or six plants in a pack -- are selling better than bigger one gallon to 15-gallon plants because customers are spending less due to higher prices and inflation.

At the East Coast Garden Center in Millsboro, Delaware, co-owner Chris Cordrey said weather is also a concern, particularly because so much of the center's business is compressed into a four-month period between March and June.

On some of the bills, such as one that could reduce compensation for injured workers, perhaps the caterwaulers are right. On public-sector unions, though, the legislators are on the side of reason and of democratic accountability.

As I noted here last year when the subject was public-sector unions in New Orleans rather than statewide, two 20th century liberal icons, President Franklin Roosevelt and AFL-CIO leader George Meany, both argued that public-sector unions are anathema to small-'r' republican government.

Roosevelt said that ""the process of collective bargaining ... cannot be transplanted into public service,"" and Meany pronounced it ""impossible to bargain collectively with the government."" Longtime centrist reform advocate Philip K. Howard, in his 2023 book ""Not Accountable: Rethinking the Constitutionality of Public Employee Unions,"" wrote that such unions, unlike private-sector ones, possess ""extortive power."" While they do not face ""any other organized opposing force"" such as business executives worried about profits, they actually hold power over the people supposed to be their bosses, namely the officials elected to represent the public, because they provide a political bloc to whom the officials cater.

Public sector unions, he said, essentially can ""do what is impossible in the private sector -- to 'capture' the officials on the other side of the table."" That's why reformist mayors and governors of both parties, Howard wrote, providing copious examples, ""all crashed into the union wall.""

In ""Not Accountable"" and other books, Howard has collected a cornucopia of horror stories about the near-impossibility of firing even the worst public-sector employees, even lawbreakers, because of overweening public-sector union power. He also cataloged copious instances of ""spiking pensions with extra overtime and disability claims,"" such as the fire chief in California who gamed the system to boost his post-retirement pension from about $140,000 per year up to well over $200,000. This all comes, of course, at the taxpayers' expense.

With those realities in mind, what exactly would some of the proposed bills do?

House bill 572 by state Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, would (with a few exceptions) ""prohibit collective bargaining agreements for public officers and employees."" No governmental body under the state's jurisdiction would even be allowed ""to recognize any labor or other employee association... with respect to any matter relating to the public officer's or employee's employment or service.""

Well, that's rather definitive. Note, though, that this would not obviate civil service protections. It would not remove the workers' rights to speak up or to organize politically. It would just remove collective, direct, employment-bargaining power.

Relatedly, Crews' proposed House Bill 571 prohibits any division of state or local government from using public funds or providing paid leave for union activities. While it would not nullify existing public-employee contracts, it would forbid the renewal or extension of existing public-employee contracts that do provide such compensation or paid leave. And it would create a right of legal action for any taxpayer to challenge any public employee for violating the prohibition.

Again, as Roosevelt and Meany explained, these are essential safeguards against bargaining ""captures"" that destroy democratic accountability.

Finally, Senate Bill 264 by Republican Alan Seabaugh of Shreveport would ensure that government workers know they have a right to join or not join a union, and would prohibit automatic payroll deductions from being used for unions' political efforts. This is eminently reasonable, and is entirely in line with two key U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the 2018 Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the 1988 Communication Workers of America vs. Beck.

None of which, by the way, is meant to dishonor civil servants, who will retain plenty of job protections, which they well deserve.

Instead, these bills merely recognize that employment on the public fisc is a different animal than private-sector employment, and that the tax-paying, voting public's interests are supposed to be paramount.

Whatever complaints there may be about some of the other labor-related bills filed in the Legislature, these three proposals should not be lumped in with those others as if they represent some sort of return to poorly paid sweatshops. These three bills merely restore common sense principles to the realm of public employment.

To offset higher costs, he had to raise prices; for example, a flower in a one-gallon pot, a standard size, had sold between $5 and $5.50 but he had to raise that to between $6 and $6.50.

So far, customers are taking the price increases in stride. Container gardening with newer ""dwarf"" size plants and fruit trees and bushes like blueberries and raspberries are popular.

""People are enjoying growing their own food and then harvesting their food,"" he said.

At Ooltewah Nursery and Landscape Co. in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has been in business for 35 years, sales boomed during the pandemic and haven't slowed down since.

Vegetable and fruit plants are big sellers, including tomatoes and eggplants, general manager Kat McGraw said. Because of the garden center's location -- two hours from both Atlanta and Nashville -- a lot of retirees have relocated there, and they have time to spend on their gardens.

Still, weather has been a challenge there too, including last year's drought and deep freeze, not normal for the area. A lot of plants were damaged.

Like elsewhere, costs have risen across the board, including costs for delivery and trucking, potting soil and even the wind chimes found in the gift shop.

But that hasn't discouraged her customers from spending, she said. The mild climate in Tennessee, weather events aside, lets people garden eight or nine months out of the year.

""People are still putting a lot of time into their yards, they all want a nice yard, and that's where they spend a lot of their time,"" she said.

Garden centers hope would-be green thumbs stay interested,"NEW YORK -- Garden centers enjoyed a pandemic boom, particularly with millennials, as people looked for outdoor activities during lockdowns. Now the question is, will those wannabe green thumbs stick with the habit?

In 2022, 80% of U.S. households took part in lawn and gardening activities, a five-year high, according to the National Gardening Association's 2023 National Gardening Survey. Spending on lawn and gardening activities rose to an average of $616 per household in 2022, an increase of $74 from 2021.

Danny Summers, managing director of The Garden Center Group, which tracks sales of about 125 centers across the country, said sales are up by about 25% compared with 2019. But the sales totals flattened out between 2022 and 2023.

The spring season is crucial, because garden centers can make about 60% of sales during the 12 weeks of spring, according to Summers. That's particularly true for centers in the North since there are fewer months to plant.

To regain the sales momentum, garden centers must navigate a number of challenges as another spring season kicks in. Chief among them are volatile weather and higher costs for labor and plant materials, which in turn has forced the companies to raise prices for customers.

One positive development: Younger households, particularly the 18- to 34-year-old age group and 35- to 44-year old age group, have seen larger increases in spending than older households, a trend that Summers thinks has legs.

""Our garden centers are just serving a new need that we don't see going away anytime soon, because this new audience is very much grounded in nature and plants and gardening,"" he said.

At Flowercraft Garden Center, a San Francisco garden center that is in its 50th year of operation, houseplants, vegetable starter plants and citrus trees are selling well, said general manager Lydia Patubo.

Since the spring season is so short, garden centers are at the mercy of the weather. Patubo said last year's unprecedented storms in the area put a dent in business. San Francisco saw record rainfall of nearly 34 inches during the 2023 ""water year,"" which ended in September. That was good for an area suffering from a yearslong drought, but bad for garden center business.

""It was a rough year,"" Patubo said. ""So, I'm hoping (this year) for less rain, better business,"" she said.

As spring kicks into gear, Patubo said smaller items -- such as four-inch plants or six plants in a pack -- are selling better than bigger one gallon to 15-gallon plants because customers are spending less due to higher prices and inflation.

At the East Coast Garden Center in Millsboro, Delaware, co-owner Chris Cordrey said weather is also a concern, particularly because so much of the center's business is compressed into a four-month period between March and June.

""We got a lot of rain last year, so that made it difficult,"" he said. ""If you miss a Saturday during the busy time when it's raining or cold out, then that really hurts your sales overall.""

While according to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, 2023 was overall the third-driest year on record, parts of the country saw above average rainfall. Meanwhile, there were a record 28 separate weather and climate disasters in 2023 that caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, such as heat waves, drought, wildfires and floods, surpassing the record 22 the U.S. had in 2020. All of those can affect plants.

Higher costs are another issue.

""What we're used to paying labor has increased tremendously,"" Cordray said. He hasn't hired fewer workers, with a staff of 200, but he created a new recruitment position and added recruitment software to help retain staff.

Schools across South Sudan have been ordered to close as a heat wave of 45°C sweeps across the country. In recent years, severe flooding has already caused major disruptions to schooling in South Sudan where, on average, children complete less than five years of formal education across their lives.

As researchers interested in both climate change and learning, we've been surprised that most public debate in this area concerns how best to teach children about climate change as part of the curriculum. Recently, we examined a less discussed, but arguably much more consequential, question: How is climate change impacting children's education worldwide?

In a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change, we reviewed studies linking climate change-related events or ""climate stressors"" to education outcomes. One of the clearest connections was between heat exposure and reduced academic performance.

A study in the US found that adolescents' math scores decreased significantly on days above 26°C. In China, hotter day-of-test temperatures were associated with a drop in exam performance equal to losing a quarter of a year -- or several months -- of schooling.

But it's not just test days that matter. Studies show that raised temperatures also affect learning over longer time periods. For example, pupils' test scores suffered when there were more hot days across the school year and even when the hotter weather occurred three to four years before exam day.

Our review also highlights how climate-related regional disasters like wildfires, storms, droughts and floods are keeping many children out of school entirely. Floods can prevent children from traveling to school and cause damage to school buildings and materials, which disrupts learning and lowers test scores.

In developing countries, storms and droughts commonly cause children to leave school permanently to join the workforce and support their families. Children in higher-income countries are not immune. They miss school days due to hurricanes and wildfires and these absences have measurable effects on education outcomes.

The impacts of climate disasters can also affect children before they are born with consequences that reverberate across their lives. For example, children whose mothers were pregnant during Hurricane Sandy were more likely to be diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition that can make schooling more challenging.

In India, researchers found that raised temperatures lead to lower test scores due to crop failure and malnutrition, highlighting the importance of indirect links between climate stressors and subsequent school participation and learning.

Our analysis suggests that climate change will exacerbate existing inequalities in global education access and attainment, with already disadvantaged groups facing the largest learning setbacks. In the US, heat had worse effects on exam scores for racial and ethnic minorities and children living in lower-income school districts.

Following a super typhoon in the Philippines, children whose families had fewer financial resources and smaller social networks were more likely to drop out of school than their better-resourced neighbors. In contexts where girls' education is less prioritized than boys', their school attendance and exam scores have suffered more following climate change stressors such as droughts and storms.

Globally, regions where people are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change -- in terms of risk of harmful stressors occurring and resources available to adapt -- are also regions where children already receive fewer years of schooling.

The impacts of climate change on education are already widely visible. While the scale of the problem is daunting, there are many ways to take action. Most critically, global heating urgently needs to be limited by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

At the same time, children's education must be protected from climate change stressors that are already occurring. Possible measures include installing cooling technologies, effective disaster response planning, building stressor-resilient schools and addressing systemic global inequalities related to socioeconomic, gender and racial discrimination.

Preventing harm to children's education is a worthy goal in itself. But improving education can also contribute to greater awareness and climate literacy, while mitigating climate change and making children more resilient in the face of climate stressors.

Education can help fight climate change. But we must also fight climate change to prevent harm to education.

The Executive Director, CAPPA, Mr Akinbode Oluwafemi made the call on Friday in Lagos, at a news conference to mark the 2024 World Water Day.

Oluwafemi said that increaseed budgetary allocation would help to revitalise the water sector, hence,improve access to potable water in the various communities.

""This also includes refurbishing dilapidated infrastructure, upgrading existing water works and building new facilities, to ensure widespread access to clean and safe drinking water,"" he said.

According to him, the year 2024 World Water Day with the theme - ""Water for Peace"", underscores the critical necessity of water for human survival and societal stability.

He called on the government to stop any ongoing or future plans to privatise water services, as it had been stated repeatedly and demonstrated globally that public-private partnerships offered no real solutions to water challenges.

Oluwafemi said that water corporations across the country must fulfill their responsibility of public water distribution across all areas, not just economically viable neighbourhoods.

He said that government must strengthen regulatory oversight and implement proper reparation mechanisms in local communities affected by water injustices like contamination, scarcity, and inaccessibility.

""These mechanisms should include measures by state ministries of health to address the consequences of prolonged exposure to contaminated water, especially for women and girls.

""Governments must support and protect water sector workers by reversing any layoff plans, enhancing water infrastructure conditions, and ensuring adequate wages, along with comprehensive training programmes to improve their skills and performance,"" the director said.

He said that above all, the government must foster a participatory approach to water governance that prioritises the voices and needs of local communities into decision-making processes related to water management.

According to him, in Nigeria alone, a staggering 113 million people suffer from painful hardship and crippling deprivation of water.

""This saddening neglect is not due to a scarcity of resources ,but rather a consequence of the profit-driven logic adopted by state authorities in managing water supply and amenities.

""The relentless pursuit of commodifying public resources, at the expense of community welfare, has led to the deterioration of vital public utilities and social services,"" he said.

Also, Zikora Ibeh, Policy and Research Analyst, CAPPA, said that across the country, people were languishing without water and it was worse for women and girls who use water for many of the things they had to do in their household

""Water is a basic right that should not even be begged for you, but then, you see people having to use contaminated water, dirty water, it is just shameful,"" Ibeh said.

Gbemisola Ahmed, a member of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporation, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services (AUPCTRE), said that the theme underscored the global recognition of water as a critical driver for collective peace and security around the world.

Ahmed, who spoke on behalf of the Our Water Our Right Africa Coalition (OWORAC), said that reliable access to safe and affordable drinking water was essential for the stability of communities.

Soon all our diesel will be biofuels. This is particularly good for the environment if the fuel is made from wastes and residues, but it's much less so if it's made from crops that use energy and land but don't produce food.

Unfortunately, a proposed amendment to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard threatens to put the state, the country and the world on a course toward relying more heavily on diesel produced from crops, ensuring more widespread destruction of rainforests and diversion of farmland from food to energy production.

California pioneered the standard to support the development and use of lower-carbon fuels for transportation. It effectively encourages oil companies to subsidize low-carbon fuels and electric vehicles without bankrupting them, and the only costs to taxpayers are administrative. This innovative policy has been replicated in Oregon, Washington and Canada, while other states and Congress are considering comparable measures.

The fuel standard incentivizes the use of renewable diesel made from oil waste and crops, a major success of the policy. Renewable diesel can be used in virtually any diesel engine, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% or more when it's made from waste oils.

The environmental benefits are much less substantial, however, when the fuel is made from crop-based oils such as soybean or canola.

That's because those crops require energy, fertilizer and land, among other environmental consequences.

Renewable diesel offers such a compelling business opportunity to oil companies that two Bay Area refineries are being converted to produce it, possibly by the end of this year. California-inspired renewable diesel is booming across the country.

As the industry grows, however, it's having some unintended consequences.

Until recently, most renewable diesel was made from waste cooking oil, rendered beef fat and corn-ethanol byproducts. But now those domestic sources of waste oil are largely tapped out. Indeed, the U.S. has to import not only waste-based fuels but also the wastes and residues themselves to supply our processors.

That means more and more renewable diesel is likely to come from oil produced from soybeans and other food crops.

We know from experience that increasing demand for plant-based oils -- whether for food, animal feed or biofuels -- leads to more slashing and burning of tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia and South America to expand palm and soy oil production. This deforestation releases mass quantities of greenhouse gases by burning trees that have sequestered carbon over centuries. It also harms watersheds, disrupts Indigenous communities and causes a raft of other social and environmental problems.

If what happened in California stayed in California, we wouldn't be so concerned. Global vegetable oil producers probably could replace California's remaining fossil-fuel-based diesel without much additional harm.

But other jurisdictions that have adopted or are considering policies like California's are watching the state carefully. And the Treasury Department, European Union and global airlines are about to embrace plant oils as a substitute for the fossil fuels used in aviation. What California decides about renewable diesel will therefore have far-reaching effects.

The California Air Resources Board is updating the Low Carbon Fuel Standard this year to raise its targets and make other adjustments, including expanding its scope to include jet planes operating within the state. It is not, however, proposing to rein in the use of crop-based fuels. If the board does not address this issue, it could spur extensive conversion of tropical forests and food production to energy generation.

So what should be done? We have two ideas.

The first is to update the fuel standard's almost 10-year-old estimate of the greenhouse gas impact of increased crop production. There is considerable evidence that the current estimate greatly understates actual emissions. Crops such as soybeans would become less attractive for renewable diesel production if the standard were corrected.

It's an elegant and seemingly simple adjustment. The problem is that there is no scientifically established method for making an estimate, even after extensive study. Picking a new number risks interminable debate and lawsuits by the oil industry and other threatened interests.

We lean toward a second idea, which is to cap the use of crops to produce fuels. Most environmental groups favor this approach, and the California Air Resources Board has considered it. But while it's a straightforward concept, it would be complicated to implement and would have to be updated frequently to provide flexibility to companies as conditions change.

Whatever approach regulators take, they should do it quickly, before the rapid growth of renewable diesel has irreversible repercussions.

The 2024 Realtor.com Housing and Climate Risk Report found that more than 44.8% of the country's homes face at least one kind of ""severe or extreme climate risk"" from either flood, wind, wildfire, heat or air quality. The total value of those homes is nearly $22 trillion, according to the study.

""It's important for people to fully understand the climate risks that a home faces not only in the present, but in the future, so they can make the most informed decision for one of the biggest purchases and investments they will make in their life,"" said Realtor.com's Mausam Bhatt, chief product and technology officer, in a statement.

Realtor.com recently rolled out climate factor risk scores using data from the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit climate technology company, that forecasts the likelihood of a given disaster over the next 30 years.

When it comes to to the total value of homes at risk of flooding, the greater Miami area ranks first, with a total value of $323.9B, followed by New York ($265.2B) and Tampa ($126.2B). New Orleans leads all cities when it comes to share of property value at risk.

Unsurprisingly, cities affected by hurricane season are also the most threatened by extreme wind. When broken down by total property value, Miami is first, followed by Houston and New York. As for cities where 100% of the homes are at extreme risk from wind, Baton Rouge, Charleston, Houston, and Tampa are among 15 major metros spanning Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Louisiana.

When it comes to property values, the top three major metros threatened by wildfire are all in California - Los Angeles ($447.9B), Riverside ($445.2B) and San Francisco ($256.4B). Colorado Springs, Colorado is first when it comes to the share of value threatened (76.4%).

As for extreme heat, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area in Florida has the highest total value under severe heat risk, while a number of cities including Austin, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jacksonville, Florida; Houston, Texas; and Tampa, Florida all have a 100% share of value.

The San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley area has the highest total value of properties at extreme air quality risk, while 100% of homes in the following cities face severe air pollution: Fresno, California; Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom, California; Spokane-Spokane Valley, Washington; and Stockton, California.

""Specifically, with high risk of wildfire and hot weather, it is not surprising to find markets with the highest total value of homes at risk from severe and extreme air pollutants are predominantly concentrated in California,"" according to Realtor's report, where you can see more on the methodology.

A Harvard study released earlier this year found that it's not just homeowners who face potentially dangerous - and costly - climate hazards. Researchers with Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that millions of rental units face climate- and weather-related threats.

""Environmental hazards such as wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and hurricanes increasingly jeopardize the health and safety of renters and threaten to damage or destroy housing,"" the American Rental Housing Report reads. ""About 41 percent of the nation's occupied rental stock (18.2 million units) is located in areas exposed to substantial weather- and climate-related threats as measured by expected annual economic losses for multiple hazards, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Risk Index.""

According to NOAA, the U.S. has experienced 377 weather and climate disasters since 1980 that cost at least $1 billion.

While aggregate occupancy remains modestly below pre-COVID levels, it is poised to improve in 2024 driven by acceleration in business transient travel, record group demand, and strong international growth.

Similarly, ADR growth is likely to continue given strong demand against a backdrop of record low domestic supply growth of net new rooms. As a result, 2024 RevPAR growth is likely to remain above long-term trends. For context, STR Global, the industry's leading hospitality research firm, is projecting 2024 U.S. RevPAR growth of 4%, while international RevPAR growth is likely to be even stronger.

Hilton's net unit growth is poised to accelerate in 2024 to ~6% or more. Hilton currently has the largest pipeline of rooms in the company's history at 462,000, of which nearly half are under construction. This growth is supported by both existing and new brand concepts including Spark and LivSmart Studios by Hilton, a new exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, and the recently announced acquisition of the Graduate Hotels brand.

Over the medium-term, Hilton stands to benefit from continued RevPAR growth (which historically grows at a premium to inflation), the acceleration of net unit growth back to Hilton's historical industry-leading cadence of 6% to 7%, and continued strong growth from non-RevPAR fee earnings. Strong high-single-digit revenue growth combined with Hilton's excellent cost control, high incremental margins, and substantial capital return program should drive robust earnings growth for the foreseeable future.

It may be thanks to those ubiquitous and long-running TV ads, and to the growing popularity of natural wonders like icebergs, whales and hiking trails.

Cathy Duke has a front-row view of this change.

She has been chief executive officer of Destination St. John's since 2011. About to retire after a career that also included stints as the deputy minister of tourism and executive director of Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador, Duke sat down recently for a conversation with Jamie Fitzpatrick of CBC Radio's On The Go.

Here is some of the conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: [Do you agree that much has] changed over the last couple of decades?

A: I started my career in economic development. During that time, tourism was one of the sectors that was still very prominent then. When I think about tourism back then, it was what we sometimes refer to now as a cottage industry. It was very small -- we were talking about bed and breakfast and some maybe some boat tours and some historic sites. There were 23 different tourism development associations, and everybody was off doing their own thing. We've come such a long way [and\ I think we got a lot of potential for the future.

Q: Do you think in part the world also moved a bit closer to us? Going back over 20 years, I don't think we heard the phrase ""adventure tourism"" that much and certainly the cruise ships were oriented our way?

A: Many years ago, we thought we needed to have what every other destination had. Along the way we realized that visitors were actually wanting what we already have, and we began to appreciate our nature, product and the value of our culture and our history. Maybe this is what we need to be putting forward.

Visitors even to this day and certainly post-pandemic, they're very much wanting what we have in Newfoundland Labrador -- they're really wanting the wide open spaces, being close to nature and just [a] quieter pace. Consumer behaviour has changed a lot over the last 25, 30 years, but even more so since the pandemic.

Q: How in a position like yours do you measure success in that job? Are there particular numbers or indicators that you track?

A: The province does track as best it can the number of visitors coming into the province through their exit survey which they do every so many years. And you know they have algorithms that extrapolate how many visitors that would be here in St. John's. Unfortunately we don't have a way to track that, but we do have a great partnership with the major hotels in the city and they do provide us numbers on a monthly basis of the number of hotel rooms sold and their occupancy... so we can get a look at the trend and see year over year what the visitation is into the city that way. We do collect numbers on the numbers of conferences that come into the city, the number of delegates, the number of sporting events, the number of motor coach tours.

Q: What should we get better at now in the years to come? What would you list as a top priority?

A: We've done a lot of really good things in terms of government and industry are working better together. That's not something that I think was as present as as it is today, because there are lots of things that require long-term efforts. There are some things out there that are other destinations are experiencing. It's not just Newfoundland Labrador [facing a] labour shortage. What we really need to think more about is how do we make the tourism industry a viable, sustainable industry by expanding the season. Many years ago, July and August were the two months, but now with the experiences we have available going right to September, October, we're turning it into a five- or six-month industry.

I think we really need to think about that, like, how do we make it an all-season experience for the province?

Q: Certainly if you're looking at sort of alternative months to the height of summer, we probably do have room for people. But in the big picture, do we have the capacity? Especially in rural areas, the accommodations will be limited. Everyone talks about how you can't rent a car in St. John's during the summer unless you book way ahead. So are there some ways in which we might have maxed out our potential?

A: There are lots of other options in terms of accommodations. We're working with with government now to have all these properties that are listed through Airbnb and so on, [to] get them licensed and so on. But there's lots of that out there.

I think with motor coaches particularly, I'd love to see a major hotel resort in the Gros Morne area. That's a real bottleneck for us. We can't sell more motor coach tours. Everybody wants to go to Gros Morne. Focusing on building the capacity variance in your largest urban centre does help all the other regions of the province. So I would like to see even more things happening in the greater St. John's area, because I think that would that would benefit other other areas of the province.

One of the things that our tour operators have been concerned with in rural Newfoundland is that they bring a tour there at a certain point in late September, then some of the historic sites or the museums or other attractions are closed. But on the other hand, [the attractions] find it hard to stay open because we're not getting enough business to cover their costs or their summer students have left and gone back to school or university, [so] they can't get labour.

So it's one of those things that's not a short-term solution. It's something that we really need to work at over the longer term and and it is a supply and demand issue. That kind of works itself over time if you're heading in the right direction and building your strengths, and doing it in that way.",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,0.2,448986718,1,https://i.cbc.ca/1.470050.1431707740!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/default-headline-image-news.jpg,

Garden centers hope would-be green thumbs stay interested,"NEW YORK -- Garden centers enjoyed a pandemic boom, particularly with millennials, as people looked for outdoor activities during lockdowns. Now the question is, will those wannabe green thumbs stick with the habit?

In 2022, 80% of U.S. households took part in lawn and gardening activities, a five-year high, according to the National Gardening Association's 2023 National Gardening Survey. Spending on lawn and gardening activities rose to an average of $616 per household in 2022, an increase of $74 from 2021.

Danny Summers, managing director of The Garden Center Group, which tracks sales of about 125 centers across the country, said sales are up by about 25% compared with 2019. But the sales totals flattened out between 2022 and 2023.

The spring season is crucial, because garden centers can make about 60% of sales during the 12 weeks of spring, according to Summers. That's particularly true for centers in the North since there are fewer months to plant.

To regain the sales momentum, garden centers must navigate a number of challenges as another spring season kicks in. Chief among them are volatile weather and higher costs for labor and plant materials, which in turn has forced the companies to raise prices for customers.

One positive development: Younger households, particularly the 18- to 34-year-old age group and 35- to 44-year old age group, have seen larger increases in spending than older households, a trend that Summers thinks has legs.

""Our garden centers are just serving a new need that we don't see going away anytime soon, because this new audience is very much grounded in nature and plants and gardening,"" he said.

At Flowercraft Garden Center, a San Francisco garden center that is in its 50th year of operation, houseplants, vegetable starter plants and citrus trees are selling well, said general manager Lydia Patubo.

Since the spring season is so short, garden centers are at the mercy of the weather. Patubo said last year's unprecedented storms in the area put a dent in business. San Francisco saw record rainfall of nearly 34 inches during the 2023 ""water year,"" which ended in September. That was good for an area suffering from a yearslong drought, but bad for garden center business.

""It was a rough year,"" Patubo said. ""So, I'm hoping (this year) for less rain, better business,"" she said.

As spring kicks into gear, Patubo said smaller items -- such as four-inch plants or six plants in a pack -- are selling better than bigger one gallon to 15-gallon plants because customers are spending less due to higher prices and inflation.

At the East Coast Garden Center in Millsboro, Delaware, co-owner Chris Cordrey said weather is also a concern, particularly because so much of the center's business is compressed into a four-month period between March and June.

""We got a lot of rain last year, so that made it difficult,"" he said. ""If you miss a Saturday during the busy time when it's raining or cold out, then that really hurts your sales overall.""

While according to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, 2023 was overall the third-driest year on record, parts of the country saw above average rainfall. Meanwhile, there were a record 28 separate weather and climate disasters in 2023 that caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, such as heat waves, drought, wildfires and floods, surpassing the record 22 the U.S. had in 2020. All of those can affect plants.

Higher costs are another issue.

""What we're used to paying labor has increased tremendously,"" Cordray said. He hasn't hired fewer workers, with a staff of 200, but he created a new recruitment position and added recruitment software to help retain staff.

To offset higher costs, he had to raise prices; for example, a flower in a one-gallon pot, a standard size, had sold between $5 and $5.50 but he had to raise that to between $6 and $6.50.

So far, customers are taking the price increases in stride. Container gardening with newer ""dwarf"" size plants and fruit trees and bushes like blueberries and raspberries are popular.

""People are enjoying growing their own food and then harvesting their food,"" he said.

At Ooltewah Nursery and Landscape Co. in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which has been in business for 35 years, sales boomed during the pandemic and haven't slowed down since.

Vegetable and fruit plants are big sellers, including tomatoes and eggplants, general manager Kat McGraw said. Because of the garden center's location -- two hours from both Atlanta and Nashville -- a lot of retirees have relocated there, and they have time to spend on their gardens.

Still, weather has been a challenge there too, including last year's drought and deep freeze, not normal for the area. A lot of plants were damaged.

Like elsewhere, costs have risen across the board, including costs for delivery and trucking, potting soil and even the wind chimes found in the gift shop.

But that hasn't discouraged her customers from spending, she said. The mild climate in Tennessee, weather events aside, lets people garden eight or nine months out of the year.

""People are still putting a lot of time into their yards, they all want a nice yard, and that's where they spend a lot of their time,"" she said.

owing further naval interventions to secure distressed shipping assets on the high seas, Navy Chief, Admiral R Hari Kumar on Saturday flagged concerns over the resurfacing of piracy as an 'industry' to gain from 'disorder in the region'.

Addressing media persons on the completion of hundred days of naval operations against operations for anti-drone, anti-missile, and anti-piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and Red Sea, Admiral Hari Kumar said the Navy will continue taking affirmative action to prevent such incidents, adding that 'Operation Sankalp', the naval operation to secure the crew of Bulgaria-flagged merchant vessel MV Ruen, has broken the myth of short and swift operations and stressed the need for sustained interventions to ensure the safety and stability of shipping assets in the oceans.

""Piracy has resurfaced as an industry to gain from the disorder in the region. We will take affirmative action to prevent that,"" the Nacy chief said at the press conference on Saturday.

""Operation Sankalp has broken the myth of short and swift operations and stressed the need for sustained operations to ensure safety and stability in the oceans. The pace of operations is quite high and we have 11 submarines and 30 warships operating in different parts of the ocean to ensure coverage of all areas of interest,"" Admiral Hari Kumar added.

""We have deployed 10 warships in the entire region for anti-piracy, anti-missile, and anti-drone operations under Operation Sankalp. The task is to ensure safety and stability for merchant vessels carrying cargo to reach shores safely. Because they are deployed there, they can respond to attacks or incidents as first responders,"" the Navy chief added.

The Navy chief noted no Indian vessels were targeted were prirates, adding that the Houthi rebels were targeting vessels linked to Israel.

""None of our Indian vessels have been targeted. The Houthis have been targeting vessels with linkages to Israel. They are also targeting ships with flags of Western countries like the UK and the US. We are getting involved because we have Indian crew on almost all these ships,"" Admiral R Hari Kumar, Chief of Naval Staff on the 100 days of the Indian Navy's operations for anti-drone, anti-missile and anti-piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and Red Sea,"" the Navy chief said.

Calling the Maritime Piracy Act 2022 a 'great enabler', Admiral Hari Kumar added that it has now enabled the force to visit, board and search pirated ships.

""The Maritime Piracy Act 2022 has now enabled us to visit, board and search pirated ships. This act is a great enabler. In the last 100 days, we may have made at least 1000 such boardings,"" Admiral R Hari Kumar, Chief of Naval Staff on the 100 days of the Indian Navy's operations for anti-drone, anti-missile and anti-piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and Red Sea,"" he said.

""Details of the ships can be found with the automatic identification system and it is easy for Houthi rebels in Yemen, and that is how they have been targeting the ships through missiles and drones. Drones are also being used to monitor the ships,"" the Navy chief added.

Earlier, on Saturday, as many as 35 Somali pirates, who were captured by the Indian Navy, were handed over to Mumbai Police after due formalities of Customs and Immigration.

Visuals from the Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, showed the pirates standing in a queue as Mumbai Police assigned them chest numbers.

The operation involved a navy destroyer, a patrol ship, an Indian Air Force C-17 transporter flying more than 1,500 miles to airdrop marine commandos, a naval drone, a reconnaissance drone and a P-8 surveillance jet, the Indian Navy release said.

Somali pirates' capture of the MV Ruen in December last year marked the first successful hijacking of a vessel off the country's coast since 2017.

But when the Ruen, now operated by a pirate crew, last week left Somali waters with the intent of committing acts of piracy on the high seas, the Indian Navy made moves to intercept it.Based on the analysis of the surveillance information the Indian Navy was able to track the movement of the Pirate Ship Ruen and directed INS Kolkata to intercept the ship approximately 260 Nm East of Somalia.

Kolkata intercepted Ruen in the morning of March 15, and confirmed the presence of armed pirates through a ship-launched drone.

The pirates shot down the drone and fired at the Indian Naval warship. In a calibrated response INS Kolkata disabled the ship's steering system and navigational aids, forcing the Pirate Ship to stop.

INS Kolkata undertook precisely measured actions while maintaining her position close to the Pirate Ship and also engaged in forceful negotiations, which resulted in the Pirates surrendering and releasing the pirate ship MV Ruen and its original crew present onboard.

All 35 Somali pirates surrendered March 16. All 17 original crew members of MV Ruen were also safely evacuated from the pirate vessel without any injury.

U.S. airports say money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a drop in the bucket when it comes to their funding sources and infrastructure needs. But the legislation is already helping some rip up worn carpets, upgrade restrooms and replace clunky baggage systems.

While federal dollars have long backed ""airside"" projects like runways and taxiways, the new infusion for terminal upgrades ""is a game changer,"" said Greg Cota, senior vice president of government and political affairs at the Airports Council International -- North America, an industry advocacy group.

As President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail to tout his infrastructure investments, airports are some of the most visible places to see them at work, whether or not voters reward him for it in November.

Appleton International Airport, in the battleground state of Wisconsin, received $3.43 million from the package. The funds will augment a much larger $66 million concourse expansion, which was planned before the pandemic and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025. Appleton, about 40 minutes southwest of Green Bay, is one of many airports that broke passenger records last year, and it expects to serve 1 million travelers this year.

Financing is coming ""from about eight different sources,"" said airport Director Abe Weber, including local, state and federal money, bonds and the airport's own cash. The grant awarded by the Biden administration will help pay for boarding bridges, a sustainability program that includes a microgrid and accessibility improvements such as ""hearing loops"" -- assistive technology for people with hearing loss.

Without those funds, Weber said, ""we probably wouldn't have been able to proceed with those pieces of the project.""

Last month, the White House announced infrastructure law grants totaling $970 million for upgrades at 114 airports intended to ""improve passenger experience, accessibility, and sustainability."" The discretionary awards are on top of nearly $2 billion in similar awards made over the past two years under the law's Airport Terminal Program, a $5 billion fund for competitive grants to support terminal upgrades.

Recent grants include $35 million to help Washington Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia construct a 14-gate terminal and transit connections to the Aerotrain and Metrorail. Another grant supplies $26 million to replace Denver International Airport's baggage handling system.

The terminal funding is just one slice of the measure's five-year, $25 billion pot for modernizing airports nationwide. Within that pool, a separate $5 billion is set aside for improvements to facilities and equipment owned by the Federal Aviation Administration, and $15 billion more is being distributed to airports through a formula based on passenger numbers.

Airports say they need much more.

""There's a lot of money out there, and Congress has been generous,"" said Kevin Burke, president and CEO of the North American airports council, who added that the government's prioritizing the passenger experience is novel. ""But it's not enough to be able to solve the long-term problem,"" he said, ""which is enough infrastructure money to be able to modernize all of our airports.""

In a report last year, the group called for $151 billion to fund ""critical"" infrastructure improvements over the next five years. Airports typically pay for upgrades with a mélange of rent from airlines and terminal vendors, landing charges tacked on to fliers' tickets, parking fees and money from various levels of government, as well loans and debt, often in the form of municipal bonds issued by airport authorities.

The new federal infrastructure funds could have an impact broader than the individual projects it's supporting, some experts said.

Because airports operate in tandem with one another, improvements at small and midsize ones can help large hubs, too, said Bill Wyatt, executive director of Salt Lake City International Airport. The Utah airport received $20 million in infrastructure law funds toward its $618.7 million building and airfield work tied to the further expansion of a just-built terminal.

While ""it's great whenever you can find some additional resources,"" Wyatt said, a boost to one airport's operations can be felt across the network, ""because suddenly one location now has added capacity, meaning we may get an extra flight that couldn't have happened except for the investment of this money.""

The funding influx may have its biggest impact at smaller airports, where ""these grants do play an important role in moving capital programs further and faster,"" said Earl Heffintrayer, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service.

South Carolina's Myrtle Beach International Airport, which serves more than 3 million passengers a year, received $10 million in Airport Terminal Program funds for an $80 million to $90 million expansion that was put on hold during the pandemic but is moving forward now. The 18-month project, which begins in June, will add six gates to the current 12 and revamp restrooms, flooring and signage in the existing terminal.

As at other airports, the Myrtle Beach construction is being financed by various sources, including ""cost recovery through billing back portions of the project to airlines operating at MYR over the life of the expanded facility,"" spokesman Ryan Betcher said. The $10 million grant will allow the airport to reduce the costs it passes on to airlines, help it retain existing flight routes and attract new ones, he said.

Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dollars are also helping some airports keep their projects on track despite higher costs from inflation.

Philadelphia International Airport is in the midst of a $1.8 billion capital program that includes upgrades to roadways, terminals and the airfield. It secured $74.4 million from the infrastructure package for initiatives that fit the ""shovel ready"" requirements for funding, Chief Development Officer Api Appulingam said.

""It's not that we wouldn't have somehow found the funds to do the project,"" she said, ""but the grants help with the uncertainty in the bidding environment."" Now, if bids come in higher than anticipated, ""we're able to cover the cost, versus trying to find that funding elsewhere"" and risk falling behind schedule, Appulingam said.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said artificial intelligence is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog Sunday at the China Development Forum.

Cook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company's commitment to China. He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple's supply chain, stores and research in the country.

Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint -- with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon neutral product. Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.

""We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,"" Cook said of the company's environmental goals. Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.

AI ""provides an enormous toolkit for every company that's wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,"" the 63-year-old CEO said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person's carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.

Like Apple, China's leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest, however US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.

A new study links climate shocks to inflation,"Food prices and overall inflation will rise as temperatures climb with climate change, a new study by an environmental scientist and the European Central Bank found.

Looking at monthly price tags of food and other goods, temperatures and other climate factors in 121 nations since 1996, researchers calculate that ""weather and climate shocks"" will cause the cost of food to rise 1.5 to 1.8 percentage points annually within a decade or so, even higher in already hot places like the Middle East, according to a study in Thursday's journal Communications, Earth and the Environment.

And that translates to an increase in overall inflation of 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points by 2035, just caused by climate change extreme weather, the study said.

Those numbers may look small, but to banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve that fight inflation, they are significant, said study lead author Max Kotz, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany

""The physical impacts of climate change are going to have a persistent effect on inflation,"" Kotz said. ""This is really from my perspective another example of one of the ways in which climate change can undermine human welfare, economic welfare.""

And by 2060, the climate-triggered part of inflation should grow, with global food prices predicted to increase 2.2 to 4.3 percentage points annually, the study said. That translates to a 1.1 to 2.2 percentage point increase in overall inflation.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University's business school who wasn't part of the research, said what he calls ""climateflation"" is ""all too real and the numbers are rather striking.""

Kotz and European Bank economists looked at 20,000 data points to find a real world causal link between extreme weather, especially heat, and rising prices. They then looked at what's projected in the future for climate change and saw sticker shock.

Usually when economists talk inflation and climate change, it's about rising energy prices in response to efforts to curb warming, but that's only part of the problem, Kotz said.

""There are these productivity shocks that we know about from climate change, from the weather phenomena caused by climate change, from heat waves and so forth to reduce agricultural productivity,"" Kotz said. ""Those also then have a knock-on effect on food inflation, on headline inflation.""

The study points to 2022's European heat wave as a good example. The high heat cut food supplies, causing food prices to rise two-thirds of a percentage point and overall inflation to jump about one-third of a percentage point, Kotz said. Prices rose even higher in Romania, Hungary and parts of southern Europe.

""I find the main result on the historic relationship between regional temperature anomalies and national inflation to be credible,"" said Frances Moore, an environmental economist at the University of California, Davis who wasn't part of the study. ""The findings are important. Price variability in essential goods like food is very painful to consumers.""

Kotz said the analysis found the inflationary pressure on food and other prices is worse in areas and seasons that are hotter. So Europe and North America may not be hit as hard as the Global South, which could afford it less, he said.

Large cities are thought to use more than 75% of the electricity produced. As climate change and global warming become more of a problem for Africa, the real estate industry becomes increasingly important to the continent's efforts at sustainable development. A report by the World Economic Forum, suggests that increasing climate risks is likely to displace millions of Africans from the areas where they live. The report further suggests that up to 2.5 million people could leave Africa's coastal areas due to sea level rise and other stressors. In the Horn of Africa, climate impacts could force up to 9% of the population - as many as 49 million people - to move in the decades ahead.

This will have diverse impact on the African economy, specifically the real estate sector. One of which is that it increases financial risk for real estate developers. Building owners face substantial financial risks due to rising global temperatures and an increase in natural disasters. For real estate occupiers, storms, floods, and droughts can swiftly demolish structures, displacing thousands of people from their homes.

In the following paragraphs, we will be discussing some of the ways that the real estate sector can help curb the impact of global warming and other climate related crises.

One of the biggest ways to curb climate change is for real estate developers to rethink their business focus. To date, the attention of private real estate developers has been focused on profit maximization. This is good, but there's a need for a balance between profit maximization and sustainability. In the past decade, there has been an uptake in green building certifications and initiatives across African countries. Certifications like Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) and Green Building Council in Nigeria has been in demand especially in maturing markets like South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana. To prevent climate change, green building standards must be implemented in all real estate projects. Buildings' value and structure can be preserved by acting.

Eko Atlantic City and Centenary City are one of the housing projects going green in Nigeria. The biggest project in the area, Centenary City, is a smart city that will be constructed entirely on a 1,264 hectare parcel of land in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory. The Centenary city project places a high priority on preserving the surrounding environment and seeks to achieve social and economic viability by fusing progressive land use with the ideas of sustainable urban design.

The ability to lower Nigeria's carbon footprint is one of the main benefits of green building. In Nigeria, traditional building techniques mainly rely on non-renewable energy sources like coal and natural gas.

Lower Operating Costs: One of the main tenets of many green building certifications is energy efficiency. Utilizing natural resources like light and air is a common feature of many green construction projects, in addition to the installation of energy-efficient heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. Developers can reduce future utility expenses by strategically placing windows, considering energy sources and equipment, and providing opportunities for natural ventilation. Indeed, according to a General Services Administration (GSA) research, green buildings' operating expenses were 19% less than the industry average.

Better Occupancy Rates: When it comes to indoor lighting, natural light, acoustics, cleanliness, air quality, and overall building happiness, green facilities often get higher occupancy ratings. This is because green building standards encourage the construction of buildings that support the health and wellbeing of their occupants.

Environmental Responsibility: To minimize environmental effects and reduce carbon emissions, green building approaches are essential. African Real Estate Developers can actively combat climate change by implementing sustainable construction approaches, such as the use of solar panels, effective insulation, and renewable materials. An example of this in Nigeria is the Sterling Bank Tower Building.

Long-term Durability and Resilience: Durability is an essential component of green building design. These buildings are more durable due to energy-efficient technologies, sturdy building materials, and climate-responsive designs. This lowers maintenance costs and generates buyers who are seeking sustainable construction solutions.

Higher Property Valuation: Green building increases a property's value and marketability. Potential renters and buyers are looking more and more for green-certified buildings as environmental responsibility and sustainability are becoming increasingly important to them. This increased demand will raise property values. It has been estimated that commercial buildings with green certification could be worth up to 7% more in rent. The resale value of green-certified properties has increased by up to 8%.

We often utilize energy-intensive heating and cooling systems to preserve thermal comfort in buildings as a response to climate change. To cut down on energy use, smart building designs that produce ideal interior conditions and passive solar systems that capture solar radiation are becoming popular throughout Africa.

For the African real estate industry, integrating renewable energy sources like solar and wind power offers significant possibilities. Solar photovoltaic systems are a workable option for environmentally friendly building energy.

The urban heatwave effect, in which buildings retain huge amounts of heat during the day and release it at night, will be experienced by more cities worldwide as urbanization and climate change continue. The currently bothersome urban heatwave effect can be leveraged to promote thermal comfort if passive solar systems can be employed to transport that solar radiation into buildings for heating or solar panels to generate energy instead. Africa landscapes will continue to change due to climate change.

In African cities, adopting sustainable urban planning techniques is essential to reducing the effects of climate change. Resilient urban settings must include effective public transportation systems, varied land uses, and compact development. Reduced carbon emissions and sustainable urban planning provide insightful information for developers and officials.

One of the major factors for sustainable urbanization is having adequate infrastructure. The Sea of China and the Sea of Japan connect Asia, especially South-East Asia, and marine travel places Asian nations in naturally occurring ports and valleys. These countries' integration has contributed to their growth and development. Much of Africa lacks this benefit because most of its nations are not coastal, there are few inland lakes and navigable rivers, and few inland islands. As a result, there are few large harbors on the continent.

Land infrastructure is essential for integration, and market size for industrialization and urbanization depends on integration. Africa has expanded despite the geographical limitations and must keep developing rapidly to become more competitive. Infrastructure that supports sustainable urban development, which in turn integrates African communities, is crucial to the future of the continent's cities.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if governments do nothing, there will be a 90% rise in greenhouse gas emissions globally between 2007 and 2030. This increase would be mostly caused by an increase in urbanization, infrastructure, and industry.

Development that is conscious is essential for the economy, social welfare, and the environment. One of the most important aspects of a city's competitiveness is preventing urban sprawl.

Stakeholders in African real estate can use innovation and best practices to generate beneficial environmental outcomes by working together regionally and adopting an informed approach. Africa can set the stage for future generations to enjoy a more wealthy and sustainable future by utilizing the possibilities of real estate to tackle environmental issues.

Elohor Juliana Aiboni as the 2023 Energy Personality Award at the just-concluded 2024 edition of the Nigeria International Energy Summit in Abuja is a great testament that she is delivering value to the nation's energy sector and other stakeholders from SNEPCo's deep-water operations.

A recognition that reflects her pledge and determination to ensuring compliance and upholding due diligence, corporate governance, and commitment to Shell's values. Elohor recorded the highest number of online votes in that category from industry participants ahead of the summit.

""I'm humbled by this recognition of my modest contributions to the oil and gas industry,"" an elated but surprised Elohor said, as she was conferred with the award at the gala dinner and award night. ""It is a tribute to the support and collaboration of Shell management and my colleagues as we work to deliver value to Nigeria and other stakeholders from SNEPCo's deep-water operations,"" she added.

Recall that Elohor was named Managing Director of SNEPCo in 2021, the first female to lead a Shell exploration company in over 60 years of operations in Nigeria. Under her leadership, SNEPCo has continued to break new grounds at Bonga, Nigeria's first deep-water production.

Bracing the challenges in the oil and gas industry which has been traditionally male-dominated, with few women ascending to top management positions. Elohor Aiboni a ""dynamic person with a strong sense of business priorities,"" is one of few women to change the narrative, becoming leader of the multinational oil company Shell's offshore business in Nigeria.

No wonder, she describes herself as ""self-motivated with great ability to work easily without supervision. Result-oriented showing a sense of urgency and can challenge positively. Very good communicator with a strong sense of business priorities.""

Also ""Elohor's appointment is a product of diligence, competence and commitment to the Shell ideals and core values, amidst our strong focus on diversity and inclusion,"" according to Marno de Jong, Shell's Senior Vice President for Nigeria adding that, ""We take pride in our intention of being one of the world's most diverse and inclusive organisations, and focus on further improving inclusion and representation in critical areas, including gender.""

A great patriot and an astute engineer of repute, Elohor Aiboni will in May 2024 be representing Shell and Nigeria at a global stage at the 2024 Offshore Technology Conference and Exhibition, (OTC), scheduled to hold May 6-9, 2024 in Houston, Texas, USA.

As one of the OTC featured speakers, she will be part of the Leaders who will discuss and dissect the Industry's most pressing topics and revolutionary technologies. OTC also focuses on the technologies and innovations needed to continue to provide the world's energy needs while helping create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for all.

It is expedient to note that Offshore Technology Conference is a landmark, the world's largest energy conference for the world, a meeting with a global reputation, and one of the few top world-class conferences and gatherings of influential leaders, policymakers, buyers, sellers, experts and media held annually at a global level in the international industry Calendar.

She is clearly, one of the leaders in the nation's oil and gas industry, who has distinguished herself not only as a dynamic administrator, seasoned leader, and technocrat but also shown a high degree of integrity and transparency in both private, religious, and public affairs.

Her ingenious, creative, pragmatic and resilient approach to leadership has brought a lot of transformation to the SNEPCo as she superintends its deep-water subsidiary in Nigeria.

From the onset, Elohor was clear on her priorities - developing people and growing the business. ""It is my responsibility and one that I take seriously. I aim to lead by example and drive inclusive leadership in a way that will encourage and empower our future leaders as they grow to take up more leadership roles and support one another to safely outperform,"" she said.

Elohor's capability and commitment have guaranteed the achievement of noteworthy milestones in her moderately short tenure. The biggest one being when Nigeria's first deep-water exploration and production vessel, Bonga, hit a 1-billion-barrel oil export mark in February 2023.

She was incredibly proud of all SNEPCo employees and contractors and commended them for the success of the Bonga FPSO and the attainment of the remarkable achievement.

She expressed that SNEPCo-operated Bonga, Nigeria's first deep offshore Floating, Production, Storage, and Offloading vessel, is more than oil and gas. It has advanced the frontiers of deep-water technology in the country, empowered Nigerian contractors, and positively impacted lives across the country.

Interestingly, Global oil major Shell Plc said it made total payments of US$4,929,307,556 to the Nigerian Government in 2023. Shell revealed this in payments to governments where it operates, which is part of its 2023 Sustainability and Payments to Governments Report published. This is in addition to more than $20 million that was remitted to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) within the same period in compliance with statutory requirements.

The social benefits of SNEPCo to Nigerians beyond oil and gas revenues are of importance to Elohor as she balances technical deliverables with social performance in the two focus areas of the company - health and education.

She recalls that among the many projects delivered with support from its senior partner, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd), SNEPCo built and equipped a 100-seat ICT Centre at the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun Delta State, while work is in progress on a $5-million e-library at the Niger Delta University in Bayelsa State.

In addition, a $10-million Geosciences Centre of Excellence is under construction at the University of Lagos. The company's scholarship schemes have provided opportunities for thousands of Nigerians to acquire secondary, university, and postgraduate education.

Speaking on the health side, SNEPCo, with the support of NNPC and in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health, implemented a capacity-improvement project for cancer treatment at the National Hospital, Abuja, which reduced the cost of cancer treatment from $10,000 to $2,000 with waiting time now less than two weeks from the previous six months.

The project involved the installation of a state-of-the-art Linear Accelerator radiotherapy machine at the hospital. SNEPCo has also built and equipped health centres, including a pediatric facility, in different parts of the country and has donated medical equipment, ambulances, and a mammogram machine to hospitals.

As a pragmatic and adventurous engineer, Aiboni has many firsts to her credit -- from being the first female asset operations manager in SNEPCo to being the company's first female MD.

As asset operations manager, Aiboni was responsible for providing leadership in health, safety, and environment (HSE), operational excellence, and overall asset management of the Bonga deepwater floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel operated by Shell in Nigeria.

Aiboni was appointed as the first female MD of SNEPCo while the Bonga FPSO vessel has a total production capacity of 225,000 barrels of oil per day and 150 standard cubic feet of gas export per day.

The height of a 12-story building, and spanning an area the size of three football fields, the FPSO explores for and extracts oil from more than 1,000 metres below sea level.

She has over 20 years of working experience in Shell. Aiboni joined the oil company as a trainee production engineer and gradually rose through the ranks over the years.

""Immediately after I completed the compulsory national youths service, there came the opportunity to sit the Shell Intensive Training Programme examination. I made it, and that's how I got into the prestigious SITP school. After a year of hard work and successful interviews, I transitioned to an employee as a Trainee Production Engineer about 19 years ago,"" Aiboni disclosed in an interview with DMG Events - a global energy show

A chemical engineer by background, Elohor has blazed the trail in the oil and gas industry since joining Shell in 2002. Among other roles, she served in production operations, project and asset management as well as operations readiness and assurance.

She also managed third-party interfaces across several Shell assets in Nigeria and Kazakhstan.

She holds a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Benin and a Master's degree in Integrated Environmental Management from the University of Bath, UK. She is a Fellow at the Energy Institute (EI), the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (FNSChE) and the Nigerian Society of Engineers (FNSE). Elohor also sits on several boards in the oil and gas sector including the Women in Energy, Nigeria (WIEN).

She is passionate about developing talent and leads a diverse team that strive to simplify work processes and pursue continuous improvement. Her leadership of the Bonga team has seen the Asset receive numerous awards, including the CEO HSSE Awards, Upstream Impact Award, and the Asset of the Year Runner-up in 2019, in the Shell Group.

Her interests include watching football, lawn tennis, listening to soothing music and traveling.

The unique and exciting story of SNEPCo deep-water operations has continued to be a motivation and inspiration in the industry within and outside Nigeria. From the side-lines, one can see an auspicious company under a focused and vision-minded Elohor who is irreversibly dedicated to the quest of distinction to build a foremost, innocuous, and cost-disciplined business that brings value to SNEPCo, its associates, stakeholders and Nigeria which remains a core for the Shell business.",championnews.com.ng,news,Champion Newspapers Limited,,0.4980392156862745,448986223,1,https://championnews.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mrs.-Elohor-Aiboni-Managing-Director-Shell-Nigeria-Exploration-and-Production-Company-Limited-scaled-1.webp,

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said artificial intelligence is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialogue Sunday at the China Development Forum.

Cook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company's commitment to China. He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple's supply chain, stores and research in the country.

Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint -- with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon-neutral product. Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.

""We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,"" Cook said of the company's environmental goals. Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.

AI ""provides an enormous toolkit for every company that's wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,"" the 63-year-old CEO said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person's carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.

Like Apple, China's leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest, however, US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.

The Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year's list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China Premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li's opening speech.

Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because ""it's so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming."" His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.

""To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,"" Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co., Lens Technology Co. and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.

The environmental theme to Cook's trip -- which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai on Thursday -- may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the US and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner doesn't divest.

The company's global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.

Apple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 metric tons of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network. It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly

While many people enjoy their inherently subtle taste, that understatedness is also why they're the perfect canvas for culinary experimentation. There are lots of different ways to upgrade the versatile vegetable, which is probably why green beans in a bag are having a moment on Tiktok. To transform them into a particularly delicious and complex side dish, try tossing them on your smoker.

If you smoke your green beans just right, they'll have a savory, campfire-like flavor with a tender yet lightly snappy texture. You can also season them in ways that pair especially well with their smokiness. Using a smoker to cook green beans is a simple, fun, and creative way to approach the staple vegetable. By imbuing them with fiery, woodsy notes, the typically subdued vegetables will punch way above their weight.

There are loads of green bean cooking tips you should know, but a particularly handy one when throwing fresh beans on the smoker is to blanch them first. Blanching is the process of boiling the veggies to soften them slightly before shocking them in ice water. (For snappier beans, leave them unblanched.)

Seasoning before cooking is also beneficial since the smoke will help lock in those flavors (including olive oil and any other fat with a decent smoke point). Simple additions like red pepper flakes and garlic powder can go a long way, but you're free to be as innovative as you like. When it comes to wood chips, you have several options depending on your preferences. Fruit tree woods like applewood and cherrywood are subtler; if you favor a more intense smokiness, opt for hickory or pecan wood.

When you're ready to put your green beans on the smoker, you'll want to reach for a perforated grill basket to allow the smoky air to circulate efficiently. Cooking low and slow (as slow as four hours and as low as 225 degrees Fahrenheit) is an option, or you can increase the intensity to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, which only requires around 20 minutes to a half hour. If you prefer a softer bean, simply let them sit in the smoker a bit longer or trade the grill basket for an oven-safe skillet, casserole dish, or pot and cover the beans in your favorite broth.

While fresh green beans are great for smoking, the canned kind take just as well to the cooking technique. Regardless of whether they're canned or snapped right off the vine, there are a number of ways to amp up the flavor of smoked green beans and even more depth to your veggies.

Brown sugar or butter (or both) will accentuate the beans' sweetness, while a touch of apple cider vinegar in the bottom of the pan will layer on a sugary sourness. Or, to really enrich the dish, try different porky add-ins. Mix uncooked bacon into a pot of green beans before they hit the smoker. As everything cooks together, the cured pork will imbue the beans with a profound meatiness, not to mention extra smokiness. Similarly, you could add smoked ham hocks or even leftover pulled pork. Smoked poultry and beef products are also fair game.

For an even more layered smoked green bean dish, start with your favorite easy green bean casserole recipe and improve it with a few extra favorite ingredients (such as cheese and onions). Load it all into a skillet for a profoundly wood-fired family-style side dish. With a smoker and some green beans, there's plenty to be thankful for.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.3019607843137255,448986077,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/llRenuqkT46bBHTnY5PZfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_daily_meal_185/448d302db441b942909cdc40921f4b87,

However, we are still exploring green, and Europe is going blue. A new country has joined, but with a new colour that we had not even considered would come into existence.

Pink hydrogen is a new form of clean energy that is gaining attention globally. It is produced in a very similar process to green hydrogen - using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called electrolysis.

The key difference with pink hydrogen is that the electricity used in the electrolysis process comes from nuclear power rather than renewable sources like solar and wind. This gives pink hydrogen some potential advantages over green hydrogen:

Pink hydrogen is still in early stages of development and adoption. But as countries look to scale up hydrogen production, pink hydrogen produced from nuclear power offers an intriguing emissions-free solution. It provides the reliability that hydrogen applications will require, while still meeting sustainability goals.

Pink hydrogen is the hydrogen that is produced through its subtraction from water and gas it has a number of benefits compared to the other hydrogen production methods. This one is so considerate to collect very low carbon hydrogen.

This nuclear-powered electrolyser will not be contributing to greenhouse gas emission pure hydrogen is the by-products in electrolysis process. Consequently, hydrogen is consistently created with no carbon emission during the process of its production.

Unconventional shades of hydrogen such as blue, turquoise, and grey, which are at least mostly based on natural gas, have a high carbon footprint. Pink hydrogen, on the other hand, is a low-carbon alternative.

Moreover, a brighter hydrogen use additionally provides the trustworthy, the consistent nuclear energy baseload. On the contrary with the intermittent free energy from solar and wind, constant power from nuclear power plants generates day and night.

Pacific has faced numerous issues in the production of hydrogen. The first thing to mention is an extremely demanding initial capital cost which nuclear power facilities use. Just one single nuclear power plant can be expensive to construct; up to $6 billion or more is the cost.

These increments in expenses make investment in the nuclear technology less appealing, and thus, renewal energies with the costs falling continuously will always remain the better option.

First, nuclear power plant correlated with the danger of radioactive wastes as the produced materials need to be disposed correctly. The issue about shipment and the storing of this hazardous waste is a key one that has to be given weight seriously on an all-round basis for thousands of years.

Moreover, contrary to the safety improvements in new reactor designs, serious environmental disasters both direct and indirect can unfortunately arise as the result of nuclear accidents.

The disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima have set out an alarming sign for nuclear power and has, therefore, triggered the lack of confidence in society regarding this form of energy.

Once again, it has been demonstrated that, when it comes to embracing sustainable development, it does not matter to invent new colors for a fuel that will accelerate the ecological transition. Pink hydrogen is a historic milestone, both in its discovery and in the initial proposals for its use, which remain to be seen.",ecoticias.com,news,ECOticias.com,,0.2705882352941176,448986003,1,https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/12867-1.jpg,eng-9420914

On some of the bills, such as one that could reduce compensation for injured workers, perhaps the caterwaulers are right. On public-sector unions, though, the legislators are on the side of reason and of democratic accountability.

As I noted here last year when the subject was public-sector unions in New Orleans rather than statewide, two 20th century liberal icons, President Franklin Roosevelt and AFL-CIO leader George Meany, both argued that public-sector unions are anathema to small-'r' republican government.

Roosevelt said that ""the process of collective bargaining ... cannot be transplanted into public service,"" and Meany pronounced it ""impossible to bargain collectively with the government."" Longtime centrist reform advocate Philip K. Howard, in his 2023 book ""Not Accountable: Rethinking the Constitutionality of Public Employee Unions,"" wrote that such unions, unlike private-sector ones, possess ""extortive power."" While they do not face ""any other organized opposing force"" such as business executives worried about profits, they actually hold power over the people supposed to be their bosses, namely the officials elected to represent the public, because they provide a political bloc to whom the officials cater.

Public sector unions, he said, essentially can ""do what is impossible in the private sector -- to 'capture' the officials on the other side of the table."" That's why reformist mayors and governors of both parties, Howard wrote, providing copious examples, ""all crashed into the union wall.""

In ""Not Accountable"" and other books, Howard has collected a cornucopia of horror stories about the near-impossibility of firing even the worst public-sector employees, even lawbreakers, because of overweening public-sector union power. He also cataloged copious instances of ""spiking pensions with extra overtime and disability claims,"" such as the fire chief in California who gamed the system to boost his post-retirement pension from about $140,000 per year up to well over $200,000. This all comes, of course, at the taxpayers' expense.

With those realities in mind, what exactly would some of the proposed bills do?

House bill 572 by state Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, would (with a few exceptions) ""prohibit collective bargaining agreements for public officers and employees."" No governmental body under the state's jurisdiction would even be allowed ""to recognize any labor or other employee association... with respect to any matter relating to the public officer's or employee's employment or service.""

Well, that's rather definitive. Note, though, that this would not obviate civil service protections. It would not remove the workers' rights to speak up or to organize politically. It would just remove collective, direct, employment-bargaining power.

Relatedly, Crews' proposed House Bill 571 prohibits any division of state or local government from using public funds or providing paid leave for union activities. While it would not nullify existing public-employee contracts, it would forbid the renewal or extension of existing public-employee contracts that do provide such compensation or paid leave. And it would create a right of legal action for any taxpayer to challenge any public employee for violating the prohibition.

Again, as Roosevelt and Meany explained, these are essential safeguards against bargaining ""captures"" that destroy democratic accountability.

Finally, Senate Bill 264 by Republican Alan Seabaugh of Shreveport would ensure that government workers know they have a right to join or not join a union, and would prohibit automatic payroll deductions from being used for unions' political efforts. This is eminently reasonable, and is entirely in line with two key U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the 2018 Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the 1988 Communication Workers of America vs. Beck.

None of which, by the way, is meant to dishonor civil servants, who will retain plenty of job protections, which they well deserve.

Instead, these bills merely recognize that employment on the public fisc is a different animal than private-sector employment, and that the tax-paying, voting public's interests are supposed to be paramount.

Whatever complaints there may be about some of the other labor-related bills filed in the Legislature, these three proposals should not be lumped in with those others as if they represent some sort of return to poorly paid sweatshops. These three bills merely restore common sense principles to the realm of public employment.

The AAP on Sunday questioned the BJP on maintaining silence over its relationship with Sarath Chandra Reddy, whose companies donated around Rs 55 crore to the BJP through electoral bonds, and who has now turned approver in the Delhi excise policy case probed by the ED.

Reddy of Aurobindo Pharma was arrested by the ED in November 2023 in connection with the excise policy case. No comments were available from Reddy or his company over the charges. There was no immediate reaction to the allegations from the BJP either.

Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians.

The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia's climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas.

The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables.

But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues.

Australia's big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more.

In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans.

""This is due to nuclear energy's very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,"" a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO's gencost report.

The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%).

In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday.

Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold.

There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%).

The policy brief said ""emerging priorities"" included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change.

Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change's managing director of policy, said: ""Investors have given the government a pretty good report card.

""They're also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia's economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital.

""We must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt.

""Investors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.""

In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia's hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households.

In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year's budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia ""must be prepared to think big"" to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition.

Albanese said that ""every nation needs to decarbonise and electrify"" and this was ""a race that Australia can win"".

""No nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home - and power it in the world,"" he said. ""This is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy.

Guterres emphasized the necessity of road transportation to deliver essential goods to meet Gaza's humanitarian needs quickly and efficiently. However, he failed to acknowledge the broader context of the conflict and the role played by Palestinian armed group Hamas in initiating the violence.

In his remarks, Guterres accused Israel of assaulting the human dignity of Palestinians and creating a crisis of credibility for the international community. Such rhetoric is not only misleading but also fails to consider the security concerns that Israel faces due to the constant threat of attacks from Hamas. It is essential to recognize that Israel has the right to defend itself and its citizens against terrorism.

Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire, ignoring the fact that Hamas continues to launch indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. By failing to address the root cause of the conflict and holding Hamas accountable for its actions, Guterres is undermining any potential for a lasting peace in the region.

Furthermore, Guterres's claims of an impending famine in Gaza are exaggerated. While it is true that there are challenges in delivering aid to the territory, Israel has consistently facilitated the entry of humanitarian supplies, including food and medical assistance. It is Hamas's mismanagement and diversion of resources for its own militant activities that contribute to the suffering of the Palestinian people.

It is important not to overlook the fact that Israel has faced relentless aggression from Hamas, which has used civilians as human shields and launched attacks from densely populated areas. The Israeli government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and ensure their safety from these acts of terror.

Instead of solely criticizing Israel, Guterres should also acknowledge the role of Hamas in perpetuating the cycle of violence and address the need for the international community to hold all parties accountable for their actions. Only by doing so can a genuine and lasting resolution be achieved for the benefit of both Israelis and Palestinians.",dcweekly.org,news,DC Weekly,,-0.3725490196078431,448985676,1,https://dcweekly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Only_effective_way_to_ramp_up_Gaza_aid_is_by_land__UN_chief_Guterres_says.webp,eng-9418935

It was with great sadness that I announced the passing of the Small Blue Roller Bag. I picked it up one day with the top handle and the plastic shell it's attached to broke/ripped apart from its connection at the extending walking handle thingy. It had been my main suitcase for nearly a decade and although I've replaced multiple wheel units over the years after they gave it their all after oh-so-many airport miles, this time the damage was terminal. Pun not intended.

As you can see, I did a bang-up job patching the damage with duct tape so I could take the bag on the press event I was literally about to leave for (it also let me use the bag for this and a few other luggage tests). That, however, was incredibly janky. I would need a new primary suitcase, and although I could certainly keep the small blue roller bag around to maintain continuity for luggage tests, that would mean keeping a bag in my garage ONLY for luggage tests. I rarely use one of the medium black bags as it is.

Let me now underline that ""maintain continuity for luggage tests"" bit. Four years and 100+ luggage tests would suddenly no longer be applicable to future ones if I suddenly threw in a totally new variable. These things are unscientific enough as it is. I'm going for Mythbuster Lite here, and throwing in ""good enough"" just won't cut it. No, I would seek an exactly sized replacement. It would not be easy.

A half-hour trip to the Camarillo Outlet Mall's handful of luggage stores proved fruitless. I brought along the broken-down blue bag for comparison, but nothing I checked out in my price range (under $200) was lining up. Sure, there's a chance some fancy-pants thing could've been the Goldilocks choice, but I didn't bother to check cause I ain't dropping $600 on a suitcase (""Neither am I,"" added Autoblog Editor-in-Chief Greg Migliore. Probably, I'm just assuming). I now dreaded driving and driving and driving throughout the greater L.A. area on a Quixotic endeavor for the right suitcase. Before doing that, though, I shrugged and turned to Amazon. After staring at measurements, it seemed like I found something that would work. It showed up. Nope, too wide. Shipped it back. I found another one, surely this would work based on this and that and also this. Nope, too deep. Back it went.

And then one day I was at Target. They had a bunch of bags, including some with the features I wanted for my personal use (locks, hard case, not ugly). On a subsequent trip, I became a weirdo shlepping a duct-taped old suitcase in a shopping cart through the store. I made sure to dress a bit spiffier than normal. There were two options that were in the ballpark, but the pale green bag shown above as the closest I had found yet. It is exactly the same height and exactly the same depth, and within a centimeter of width. In terms of inches, it's exactly the same dimensions. As this is an American outfit, I was willing to call it.

Welcome to Team Luggage Test, Green Bag!

As a happy benefit, it's a photogenic color, and it's also a pretty nice bag, rolling far smoother and easier than the old blue bag. It's also heavier, but you can't win'em all. Price tag was $172. More than my cheap ass wanted to spend, but given the circumstances, whatever.

In a letter sent Sunday to Premier François Legault, official opposition interim leader Marc Tanguay said that the period for requesting an environmental impact study by the Bureau d'audiences publique sur l'environnement (BAPE) for Northvolt has passed, and he urges Mr. Legault ""not to reproduce the same mistakes in the future.""

""For the economy, the environment, our SMEs and our regions, the success of the battery sector requires a generic BAPE. Your government must demonstrate greater rigor and transparency,"" the letter reads, a copy of which was sent to The Canadian Press.

In his letter, Tanguay maintains that a generic BAPE ""should not be perceived as an inconvenient and harmful step.""

""On the contrary, it is a collective meeting to define a respectful and optimal vision on the economic, environmental and social levels,"" he argues. ""Ultimately, Mr. Legault, by responding favourably to our request, you will create the first winning condition for social acceptability.""

According to Tanguay, a generic BAPE in the battery sector is ""squarely within the mission"" of the organization, based on the principles of the Sustainable Development Act, and ""it can be done in a few months.""

The organization has carried out 11 generic mandates since its creation in 1978, in particular on the ""inventory and management of asbestos and asbestos mining residues"" in 2020, according to the BAPE website.

""For us, the Quebec Liberals, the battery sector, we want it to work. But for it to work, we have to get Quebecers involved. And for that, it takes more transparency, rigor, it takes a vision,"" Tanguay argued in an interview. ""In the Northvolt file, we understood, there will be no BAPE. That said, there is the concept of generic BAPE, in the battery sector. This is what we are asking. We must have collective reflection; we must have collective support for the multiple projects and (economic) opportunities that the battery sector represents.""

The Liberal leader did not fail to throw a barb at Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon, who, according to him, ""manages this as he sees fit, on a small-time basis.""

""Pierre Fitzgibbon cannot claim to have all the answers (...) He cannot talk about social acceptability by simply saying that Quebecers must change their attitude. There is a tool that we have given ourselves - the generic BAPE - which would have no negative impact on the progress of the Northvolt project,"" he said.

""It is up to Premier Legault to say, as a 'responsible government (...) we are going to ask for a generic BAPE,'"" said Tanguay.

Lakehead University's department of geology has received $2 million in provincial funding to develop a new model for mineral exploration in Northern Ontario.

This research will study the geological processes leading to the formation of valuable mineral deposits. It will develop novel models for industry partners to seek new deposits that will be developed into mines. The research work is focused on nickel-copper-platinum and gold.

A team that will involve 30 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will work on a range of sites where the researchers will develop models that can be applied to create more efficient exploration in Canada.

Peter Hollings, director of Lakehead's Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Mining and Exploration, and Noah Phillips, an assistant professor in geology, will lead the research effort.

The funding is coming from the Research Excellence program within the Ministry of Colleges and Universities' Ontario Research Fund.

""The funding will allow us to continue to develop mineral deposit research at Lakehead University, which in turn will establish us as an essential partner in the search for Ontario's critical minerals and the training of the next generation of geoscientists,"" said Hollings in a news release.

""We will develop an innovative research hub at Lakehead University that will train a diverse group of highly qualified people in a wide range of traditional and state of the art techniques,"" Hollings said.

""Combined with undergraduate research projects, this will help reverse the current trend of declining numbers of graduate students working on mineral deposit studies in Canada,"" he said.

Hollings is also the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Industrial Research Chair in Mineral Exploration.

Australia's big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more.

In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans.

""This is due to nuclear energy's very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,"" a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO's gencost report.

The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%).

In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday.

Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold.

There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%).

The policy brief said ""emerging priorities"" included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change.

Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change's managing director of policy, said: ""Investors have given the government a pretty good report card.

""They're also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia's economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital.

""We must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt.

""Investors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.""

In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia's hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households.

In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year's budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia ""must be prepared to think big"" to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition.

Albanese said that ""every nation needs to decarbonise and electrify"" and this was ""a race that Australia can win"".

""No nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home - and power it in the world,"" he said. ""This is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy.

""There are very serious destructions, all transformer substations are destroyed, the thermal power plant is destroyed,"" said the mayor.

According to Terekhov, repairs are currently underway, but there is no exact date for the completion of the work as the damage is too severe.

On the morning of March 22, Russian military forces launched massive missile strikes on energy infrastructure facilities in various cities of Ukraine, including Kharkiv. The Russian Ministry of Defense called these attacks retaliatory strikes.

At the moment, hourly power restrictions have been imposed in the administrative center of the Kharkiv region for about 200,000 residents.

Kharkiv is the main city of the eponymous region, which borders the Russian Belgorod region. Belgorod and the settlements within the Russian region are regularly subjected to shelling and drone attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).

That is in part because of widespread damage caused by the Israeli military to the agricultural sector in the Gaza Strip.

""When it comes to livestock losses - obviously this is a sector we're very concerned about as it's indispensable for the livelihoods and the survival of families in Gaza - we estimate that 60 percent of the milk cows have been killed,"" Paulsen said.

When it comes to meat production, as much as 70 percent of the cattle stock has been killed. About 60 percent of small ruminants such as goats and sheep have been killed.

""When we look at the trajectory of food security and nutrition statistics, we are facing a catastrophic situation in technical terms,"" Paulsen added.

Israel has launched a deadly military offensive on the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas which Tel Aviv said killed less than 1,200 people.

More than 32,100 Palestinians have since been killed and over 74,500 injured amid mass destruction and shortages of necessities.

Israel has also imposed a crippling blockade on the Gaza Strip, leaving its population, particularly residents of northern Gaza, on the verge of starvation.

The Israeli war has pushed 85% of Gaza's population into internal displacement amid acute shortages of food, clean water and medicine, while 60% of the enclave's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN.

Israel is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. An interim ruling in January ordered Tel Aviv to stop genocidal acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.

BOOK fans have attacked the Netflix adaptation of sci-fi novel 3 Body Problem, claiming it butchered the novels.

3 Body Problem is based on a novel by Chinese sci-fi author Liu Cixin called The Three-Body Problem.

It's the first novel in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy and the latest TV adaptation of the text.

The narrative follows a past, present, and future that focuses on Earth meeting with an alien civilization.

It's a complex story that is a bit difficult to translate to other types of media.

The novel has been described as confusing by some, and it follows multiple points of view and narratives.

While there are other TV shows and movies based on the book, this is the first attempt from Netflix.

It's been getting mixed reviews since its debut on the streamer.

Fans headed to X, formerly known as Twitter, to voice their displeasure over the adaptation.

""Just made the mistake of watching some of #3bodyproblem on Netflix. I loved Cixin Liu's trilogy. They have done him an injustice here. The books are a masterpiece. The show is a hot mess..."" one posted.

""The Chinese series is more faithful to the books,"" another insisted.

""Tencent's #threebody is way better than Netflix #3bodyProblem,"" a third wrote.

One viewer was a bit more kind, though they had issues with the show too.

""Just finished #3BodyProblem episode 1 and boy am I annoyed that they've split Wang's storyline into five different (and brand new) people,"" they wrote. ""

""But! Benedict Wong's awesome. Ramin Djawadi's score is great. Scenes from China are spot on. Onto episode 2.""

Still, despite the criticism, it seems 3 Body Problem is staying at the top of Netflix's popular titles for the week.

Netflix has already canceled one of its big budget shows after a short run.

Dance Monsters, Netflix's talent competition, brought CGI characters to life through visual effects.

The series saw contestants transform into animated ""monsters"" as they performed.

Despite fan enthusiasm for a sophomore season, Netflix has canceled any future installments.

An insider revealed to The Sun: ""Dance Monsters was meant to be Netflix's Masked Dancer. It had huge potential for more series.""

But despite the dazzling visuals, the ratings apparently couldn't justify the production costs.

So after just one season, the monsters have been shelved.

Though Netflix declined to comment, the writing seems to be on the wall.

While available to stream worldwide, Dance Monsters physically filmed in London.

New Yorker Chris Matesevac ultimately took home the cash prize.

The latest installment dropped only 6 episodes compared to the previous 2 seasons' 8 apiece.

Now fully available on Netflix after a March 14 premiere, fans quickly binged the new chapters.

The show follows a washed-up 90's girl group thrust back into stardom after getting sampled by a hot new rapper.

They balance music dreams with adult realities like divorce, parenting, and 9-to-5 jobs.

Girls5eva stars Sara Bareilles, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Paula Pell, and Busy Philipps playing former one-hit wonders determined to have their comeback.

Fans flooded Twitter begging Netflix to renew Girls5eva for a fourth season.

Many expressed fear this could be the final curtain call.

""I'm not giving Netflix the benefit of the doubt. Their history of axing quality shows with little notice is well known,"" one user vented.

Others raged at the streamer's tendency to cancel beloved programs, making them hesitant to even start new shows.

""I really need #Girls5eva to blow up on Netflix so we get Season 4!"" one fan tweeted.

Published as part of the ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2024.

On 30 January 2024 the ECB published its climate and nature plan 2024-2025, which identifies three new focus areas that will guide its climate actions over the next two years. This box explains the economic reasoning behind the ECB's decision to advance its work in these three areas.

Climate change is increasingly affecting the euro area economy. The world is way off-track in terms of meeting the climate targets consistent with the 2015 Paris Agreement. 2023 was the warmest year ever recorded, and several extreme weather events caused economic damage in Europe and across the world. In parallel, accelerated biodiversity loss and degradation of habitats are contributing to a rapidly evolving crisis for nature, partially owing to the inextricable links between climate and nature. Climate change and the related need to foster the green transition are increasingly affecting the economy and the financial system. This may have implications for price stability, financial stability and the transmission of monetary policy. Climate change also affects the value and risk profile of assets on the Eurosystem balance sheet. It is essential for the ECB to account for these effects in order to deliver on its primary objective of price stability.

Since 2021 the ECB has broadened its commitment to integrating climate change considerations into its activities. Following the review of its monetary policy strategy, in 2021 the ECB announced its first climate action plan, in which it committed to including climate change considerations in activities related to monetary policy implementation, macroeconomic analysis and statistics. In 2022 the scope of the plan was expanded to cover climate activities in other areas of the bank's activities, including financial stability and banking supervision. After completing an in-depth stock-take of its climate actions, in January 2024 the ECB published an updated plan for the period 2024-2025. For the first time, this plan includes the commitment to analyse nature-related issues. It identifies three focus areas that will guide the ECB's climate-related activities for the next two years (Table A).

The first focus area looks at the challenges involved in navigating the transition towards a green economy. To comply with its 2050 net zero target, Europe will need to implement dedicated policy measures until 2030 to incentivise a shift towards energy-efficient production processes and consumption patterns, and to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. This will result in profound structural changes to the euro area economy, with implications for employment and skill requirements. It may cause a reallocation of capital with ambiguous long-run effects on potential growth. The green transition will have an impact on trade and capital flows in the euro area economy and pose risks to its external competitiveness. The euro area may also become more vulnerable to supply chain risks and interruptions to the supply of critical minerals needed for the transition. It is important for the ECB to have a thorough understanding of these structural changes and challenges, and how they could impact the macroeconomic outlook for the euro area. To do so, macroeconomic models need to be adapted accordingly.

Green investment, technological innovation and green funding are key to moving towards a low-carbon economy. The estimates by various institutions of how much green investment is needed to achieve climate goals vary widely. For instance, according to the European Commission, the transition will require additional annual investment of €620 billion until 2030 for the EU to reach its 55% emission reduction target. The ECB will take a closer look at the different estimates available to better understand the underlying assumptions and driving factors, including the role of climate change policies. It will look at the framework conditions required to facilitate the necessary investments, including the need to foster an environment conducive to high levels of research and development and innovation capacity, and a market infrastructure that encourages risk-taking. Close attention will be paid to the funding side of green investment needs. Although there has been strong growth in green finance instruments in recent years, they still only account for a small share of total debt securities issued in the euro area (Chart A). Specifically, the ECB will analyse whether the supply of funding is meeting demand, what lending conditions firms are facing for green investment projects, and how public policies can help mobilise more private funding, including through better disclosure requirements. These are all relevant issues for monetary policy and its transmission mechanism.

The second focus area aims to address the increasing physical impact of climate change. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and their costs increasingly clear. Together with changes in weather patterns, they affect the macroeconomy and financial sector through various channels. Changes to the climate particularly affect the agriculture, tourism and, via food prices, the retail and restaurant sectors. After the heatwave of summer 2022, food price inflation in Europe is estimated to have risen by 0.67 percentage points a year later. Increased global heating is found to have non-linear effects on food prices, posing risks to heightened inflation dynamics going forward. Empirical analyses find that increases in temperature above certain thresholds reduce labour productivity and economic growth. It is essential for the ECB to enhance its assessment of how a changing climate affects inflation and the economy. Besides access to high-quality data, this will require further exploration of how to integrate the physical impacts of climate change into climate scenarios and the analytical framework used for the macroeconomic projections.

Adaptation finance will be a major area of new research. The costs associated with the physical impact of climate change pose financial and fiscal risks, yet only a quarter of climate-related catastrophic losses are insured. However, adaptation investment to limit exposure to physical climate risks will divert resources away from more productive investment opportunities. The ECB will explore the economic and financial implications of climate adaptation measures and the associated funding needs required to make the economy more resilient to a changing climate.

The third focus area explores nature-related risks. There is growing evidence that climate change has adverse implications for nature, while the degradation of nature in the form of intensive land use, pollution and overexploitation of resources amplifies the climate crisis. Degradation of nature leads to reduced capacity for carbon uptake and storage and lowers the resilience of soil to the impacts of extreme weather events and a changing climate. In Europe, more than 80% of habitats are already in poor condition. Nature loss poses a serious risk to humanity, as it threatens vital functions, such as the supply of food and medicines.

Degradation of nature affects the economy and leads to financial risks. According to the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), 48% of euro area firms are very concerned about the implications of environmental degradation for their business. This is in line with recent research finding that 72% of euro area non-financial corporations are strongly dependent on at least one ecosystem service, such as healthy soils, clean water and protection against floods. As these firms account for 75% of the corporate loan exposures of euro area banks, nature-related risks pose a clear risk to banks (Chart B). The ECB will study the implications of nature and biodiversity loss for the economy, their interplay with climate change and how they can affect macroeconomic variables relevant for its mandate.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,-0.003921568627450966,448984908,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?0ef1632c35edede913681bb76af694a4,

Wade and remove a constitutional right to abortion.

But the effects could be more widely felt, some economists and healthcare experts say, if an upcoming high court debate about a mail-order abortion pill results in greater restrictions in the years ahead.

The issue will be front and center for many Americans in the coming days as the Supreme Court hears a case that could change access to Danco Laboratories' mifepristone -- the commonly used medication that can be ordered in some places without an in-person clinic visit.

The pill allows a person to end a pregnancy in its early stages.

""I am not sure that the general public really understands that the mifepristone case could be bigger than Dobbs,"" Middlebury College economist Caitlin Myers says, referring to the landmark 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""There are potential future worlds in which this case reduces abortion access far more,"" she added in a recent interview.

Oral arguments are set for Tuesday, with a decision possible by this summer.

To make things even more complex, a parallel debate in the US around in vitro fertilization (IVF) could have yet another set of economic effects -- with a different universe of Americans potentially being impacted -- if policy changes are considered on that front either in Washington or at the state level.

Mifepristone is part of a decades-long trend toward telemedicine that was spurred in recent years by the COVID-19 pandemic but then turbocharged in the reproductive health space by the Dobbs decision.

The Supreme Court's ruling has led to abortion bans in more than a dozen states. Thousands of residents in those states responded by traveling for these services while also relying more directly on telemedicine.

Medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the US healthcare system in 2023, up from 53% in 2020, according to new data from the Guttmacher Institute released last week. Tellingly, the sharpest increases were in states that bordered areas where abortion is now banned.

""Telehealth was increasing and then exploded,"" said Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, adding, ""That's true for reproductive care as it is with anything else.""

Abortion access and economics have been linked for years. One recent study at UC San Francisco found that those with the ability to access abortion ""were more financially stable"" and able to live more ambitious and productive lives as a result.

Republicans, for their part, have been skeptical of looking at abortion through an economic lens, preferring instead to keep the focus on moral issues.

Professor Myers and others nevertheless say economic issues are inextricably intertwined.

Myers spearheaded a Supreme Court amicus brief with over 150 of her academic colleagues in 2021 on the economic effects of abortion. She also testified to Congress earlier this year on how Dobbs has proven to be ""an inequality story, not a macro-level shock story"" -- with the impact of abortion bans being most strongly felt by poorer people of color.

Tens of thousands of poorer residents of the 14 states where abortion is banned don't have the means to travel elsewhere to access an abortion. A recent Institute of Labor Economics study pegged the number at about 30,000 births that wouldn't have happened in recent years if abortion had been available everywhere.

On the other hand, the total number of abortions in the United States has risen since the Dobbs decision, according to Guttmacher Institute data. It may have risen more if the ruling had never come down, but that was far from the decline many were predicting. Telemedicine may help explain that development.

""I was really thinking about the decreased access in banned states and not about the fact that access would actually improve in so much of the country almost as a result of the ruling,"" says Myers, adding, ""That's one thing that took me by surprise.""

The convergence of these trends raises the stakes for the coming mifepristone decision. The case was brought by a conservative group called Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and challenges current policies allowing widespread access.

At specific issue are moves in 2016 and 2021 from the Food and Drug Administration to allow the medication to be prescribed online without an in-person doctor's visit. The group argues that the moves to change that policy ""were arbitrary and capricious.""

The court could also look at current rules that allow the medication to be used up to around 10 weeks of pregnancy. The court declined to take up a separate case around the question of whether mifepristone should be banned entirely.

Limiting mail-order medication could cause ""even larger economic damage than Dobbs,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, said in a recent congressional hearing on the issue.

Whitehouse, at that hearing, also surfaced concerns about in vitro fertilization.

""Even in vitro fertilization is under the gun, at the hands of right-wing extremists,"" he added.

IVF is a hot-button issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law, sparking off an immediate backlash and a move within the state to protect IVF providers from legal liability.

Republicans dispute Whitehouse's characterization and often express their support for IVF but it's already a key campaign trail issue.

Some GOP leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also discussed IVF as ""a states issue,"" which could open the door to different access levels depending on where one lives.

Economically speaking, the effects of any potential IVF restrictions are only beginning to be studied.

One study of access in Israel centered on a 1994 move to make in vitro fertilization free. It found that increased access ""contributed to better labor market outcomes, reducing the gender gap in career achievement.""

It's unclear if inverse effects would be felt if IVF access is rolled back, but Myers says it's likely that limitations would be an issue more felt by people higher up on the income spectrum.

IVF changes are ""particularly likely to impact women with more education who've invested more in their careers, who've delayed motherhood,"" she says.

How the IVF issue plays out politically remains to be seen but advocates like Tipton are in the midst of a push to pass national legislation that could enshrine access to IVF.

""There has been such a bipartisan outpouring of support for IVF, and we are really hoping to help policymakers make that support more manifest,"" he says, adding a mantra many on his side of the debate would apply to the array of reproductive health issues at play in 2024.

""A patient's ability to access needed medical care should not depend upon their ZIP code.""

We survived the power sector financial crisis by the ingenuity of Mr. Dubik Mahama

The past four years of the energy sector have faced significant challenges, marked by a lack of clear direction and oversight.

This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply.

Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation.

Recognizing the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

While the Ministry of Energy's absence was a glaring gap, the empathy and resilience shown by the ECG's Managing Director is a demonstration of effective leadership, competence and has indeed saved the power sector.

Nadia Vitels, the woman found dead in a duffel bag in a Manhattan apartment, had a diverse and varied career -- from marketing in the nonprofit world to running Sugarpova, tennis star Maria Sharapova's candy company -- but her last job and the one that was perhaps closest to her heart was working with her son at his business.

At her funeral March 18 in Long Island, Michael Medvedev eulogized his mother, describing her move from Moscow to Stillwater, Okla., as a young woman, her drive to provide him with the best of everything and her unwavering support.

""She then worked for a few more companies in the tennis world and ended her amazing career at home, with I think was her favorite job and what she was most used to, working with me,"" said Medvedev, 24.

""She believed in me. She moved the Sugarpova candy to the side and made space for the plant-based cups.""

Medvedev started Earth Brands with friend Peter Frelinghuysen in 2021 while the pair were still students at Williams College. After noticing how many plastic cups littered the campus, they came up with a biodegradable, compostable, alternative made from corn and sugar resin.

The following year, businessman and Shark Tank regular Mark Cuban was one of their first investors, according to the company's website.

CBS profiled the company in 2021, shooting at the Long Island home of Vitels and Medvedev and speaking with the young entrepreneur and his proud mother, who was another investor.

In the segment, Vitels helped Medvedev move packages from the first shipment of 100,000 cups in the garage, not the first time the space had been used for a business venture.

""I kind of gave in to this. The original thought was no way,"" Vitels told the reporter with a smile.

The second shipment was half a million cups, which Vitels said in the segment would not be stored in the garage.

""It's not coming here. That's a given,"" she said, waving her hand.

Vitels, 52, was found by her son March 14 in an apartment on E. 31st St. near Third Ave. that she was readying for a family friend to move into. Medvedev discovered a foot sticking out of a bag in a hall closet.

The city's Medical Examiner said Vitels had been killed by blunt force trauma to her head, ruling her death a homicide on March 15.

NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Vitels had been attacked by a pair of squatters, who then dumped her belongings down the unit's garbage chute and stole her Lexus after the slaying, fleeing New York.

""We believe that some squatters had taken the apartment over and this woman came home to get this apartment set up and walked in on the squatters,"" Kenny said.

The two squatters wanted for killing Vitels were apprehended by U.S. Marshals in York, Penn., police sources said Friday. The duo, a 19-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman, had been on the run since they allegedly killed Vitels, fleeing in her stolen Lexus.

It reduced the real incomes and net wealth of most households as there was no immediate increase in nominal wages and pensions, nominal house prices and the nominal value of bonds, deposits, cash and debt following the rise in the price level. This influenced households' present and future consumption and therefore their welfare. Although poorer households suffered most from the reduction in the purchasing power of their income, overall welfare losses were especially large for retirees because of the fall in the real value of their relatively large holdings of nominal assets. Conversely, younger and heavily indebted households benefited from the reduction in the real value of their liabilities. In this sense, this inflation episode mimicked an age-dependent tax. Indeed, not everyone was a net loser: while about 70% of households suffered a loss, the rest enjoyed moderate gains.

After three decades of low and stable inflation in advanced economies, prices rose sharply after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In the euro area, inflation reached a peak of 10.6% in October 2022. The increase was marked and unexpected, and energy and food prices were its main drivers. The question is, did all households bear the costs of this surge in the price level equally, or was the burden shared unevenly?

In Pallotti et al. (2023), we estimate the different effects across households of the 2021-22 surprise inflation episode. We first describe a simple framework which illustrates all the various mechanisms through which this inflation episode affected household welfare, both on impact and over time (for related frameworks, see Fagereng et al., 2022; and Del Canto et al., 2023). We specifically take into account the fact that this episode featured both an increase in the price level and a change in relative prices, which meant that the effects differed across individual households because they purchase different consumption baskets. We then quantify the role of four different factors - nominal assets and liabilities; wages and pensions; capital gains; and consumption baskets - as well as the impact of ad hoc fiscal policies. To that end, we use several micro datasets - including the Household Finance and Consumption Survey and the Household Budget Survey - as well as aggregate time series.

Throughout our analysis, we assume for simplicity that the inflation shock is transitory: after 2022 real wages and the prices of real assets return to their previous levels, and all relative goods prices go back to their pre-shock values. The welfare loss owing to the slow adjustment of nominal wages and nominal house prices is therefore transitory, and so too is the welfare loss for prospective house sellers (and the welfare gain for buyers), owing to the slow upward adjustment of nominal real estate prices. By contrast, the welfare loss (gain) on all nominally denominated assets (liabilities) is permanent.

The impact of the inflationary episode was large and it differed across households. In 2021-22 the welfare losses suffered by the median euro area household amounted to roughly 4% of disposable income - more than in a typical recession.

Across households, the largest losses were experienced by retirees because they tend to hold larger amounts of nominal assets (such as cash and deposits) and the real value of these assets is sensitive to price increases (Figure 1; see also the classic work by Doepke and Schneider, 2006). In contrast, households with long-term debt (such as mortgages) benefited from the higher price level because of the reduction in the real value of their liabilities. This ""net nominal position"" channel particularly hurt middle-income retirees, who suffered welfare losses equivalent to 11% of their 2021-22 income. In comparison, retirees with low incomes, who hold less wealth, and retirees with high incomes, who own more real assets such as housing, had smaller welfare losses.

The slow adjustment of nominal wages and pensions was a key driver of welfare losses across all age groups. As nominal wages and pensions did not immediately adjust to higher inflation, labour market income lost purchasing power. In 2021-22 nominal wages grew by less than 3% on average for most countries, age groups and consumption groups, which is much less than the respective average inflation rates over the period. Pensions grew only slightly more than wages. This channel generated welfare losses amounting to 4% of 2021-22 income for the median household.

The varied inflation rates experienced across households owing to differences in their consumption baskets produced smaller effects. On the one hand, poorer households suffered larger losses than richer households because a larger share of their budget is spent on food and energy, which recorded sharp price rises (Bobasu et al., 2023). At the same time, these changes in relative prices were partly compensated by the decline in the real value of property rents. As a result, this consumption basket channel had a more muted impact than the devaluation of all nominal wealth and the drop in real labour market income. Changes in the real value of housing and stocks (the ""capital gains"" channel in Figure 1) had only a small effect.

The sum of these four channels represents the welfare change that households would have experienced if governments had not intervened. However, during this period several ad hoc policies were introduced in response to the shock (see, for example, Dao et al., 2023). Some of these policies, such as energy price caps, energy subsidies and reductions in taxes on fuels, reduced the actual prices faced by consumers. Others consisted in transfer payments to vulnerable demographic groups (see, for example, Basso et al., 2023 and Freier and Ricci, 2023). Although these measures were deficit-financed, they had limited inflationary effects (Dao et al., 2023). We find that these unconventional fiscal policies were key to cushioning the effects of the shock on households, particularly the most vulnerable, and reduced by 2% of 2021-22 income the welfare losses caused by the inflation surge for the median household. Retirees benefited the most from these policy interventions, principally because they were the largest losers from the inflationary episode, but also because they consume a relatively larger share of energy. Most of the cushioning effect came from policies related to energy prices, while direct transfers to households had less impact.

We also find substantial differences in welfare costs across the larger euro area countries. The welfare losses for the median household ranged from 3% of disposable income in France and Spain, to 8% in Italy (Figure 2). Cross-country differences were mostly caused by the differences in national inflation rates and by differences in the distribution of net nominal wealth, together with the different fiscal policies. Younger indebted households experienced net gains because the real value of their debt dropped. This effect was stronger in France and Spain, where many young households have mortgages. However, not all young households benefited: on average, those who were not homeowners with a mortgage also suffered welfare losses.

Analysing the 2021-22 inflation surge in the euro area, we find large average welfare losses, especially compared with commonly estimated costs of a typical recession, and substantial differences across countries. Within countries, we find differences across age groups, but not across income groups. While this wide variation posed a challenge for monetary policy, we find that unconventional fiscal policy measures helped to substantially compress these inflation differentials across households. Therefore, this historical episode highlights the importance of fiscal policy in responding to country-specific dynamics within a monetary union, where monetary policy cannot be tailored to individual countries.

Although the heaviest burden fell on retirees, this group had previously benefited from a relatively long period of low inflation (in 2013-21) and many of them still held residual ""excess savings"" built up during the pandemic, which might have been used to limit the drop in their consumption. Additionally, euro area countries, like most advanced economies, have large amounts of public debt for which the repayment burden falls on future generations. In this sense, the ""inflation tax"" is transferred from retirees to the young, partially offsetting this looming fiscal adjustment.

This, he said, is following the project completion of the gravity feed water system that was delivered at a fraction of the cost through public-private partnerships.

With a budget allocation of RM800,000 from the Sarawak government, the water supply project was made possible with the help from the International Youth Centre (IYC) volunteers under the Youth and Sports Ministry, the Malaysian Humanitarian Movement (MHM) and the local community, he disclosed.

""In 2019, my prayers for my constituency were answered when our Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg approved the funds for the purchase of materials for the Long Puak pilot project in Ulu Baram,"" said Dennis when met in Long Watt near here today.

The Long Watt water pipeline and storage tank project was undertaken by the Miri Resident's office, Telang Usan community service centre, Kuala Lumpur International Youth Centre Foundation, Malaysian Humanitarian Movement Association, Humanitarian Development Foundation, and the Kampung Long Suling and Long Watt village security and development committees.

""The project was able to be delivered two months ahead of schedule, involving the installation a 3.5-km pipe and kinetic pumps and other engineering works.

Long Watt, a Kayan-Kenyah settlement in the Telang Usan constituency, is located four hours' drive from Miri.

The 100-door longhouse folks had over the years been pressing the authorities to replace the old rundown pipeline system.

Maliki had presented the idea during a casual coffee session where he drew the project's concept on a piece of tissue paper, but Dennis himself was actually drawn to what the concept had to offer -from its free technical expertise to voluntary manpower.

""Funds were the main concern for these much-needed development projects in the rural areas,"" Dennis admitted.

Valderrama

Published as part of the ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2024.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis have interacted with the ongoing transition to a greener and more digital economy, with uncertain impacts on productivity growth. During the acute phase of the pandemic, productivity per employee fell as a result of labour hoarding and reduced capacity utilisation. The rapid policy responses to the pandemic-induced crisis at the national and European levels prevented a wave of bankruptcies, but also possibly inhibited productivity-enhancing reallocation of resources. The pandemic changed the ways in which firms invest and produce and people consume and work, triggering an acceleration of the ongoing digitalisation of the euro area economy, also supported by the Next Generation EU (NGEU) funds. These changes can have substantial and positive impacts on productivity, but further investments in complementary skills and intangibles are needed to reap their full benefits. In addition, the energy price shock that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the transition to a greener economy are changing relative prices of inputs and affecting the production and investment decisions of firms, with a bearing on their productivity. The impact is expected to be negative over the short term but, given the need for production processes to adapt, green innovation might lift productivity prospects over the longer term.

This article summarises the key results of recent work on productivity by a group of experts from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The analysis builds on previous work undertaken in the context of the ECB monetary policy strategy review.

The article is organised into four sections. After this introduction, Section 2 studies the impact of the pandemic and support policies on productivity and resource reallocation across and within sectors of activity. Section 3 analyses the potential productivity impact of the digital and green transitions: the section first explores whether and through which channels digital technologies could be a game changer for productivity growth in the euro area, and then examines the impact of the change in relative input prices brought about by the green transition and recent energy shock on innovation and productivity-enhancing resource reallocation. Section 4 concludes this article.

The pandemic differed from previous crises in at least three ways: (1) the broad impact of the crisis across countries, sectors and firms; (2) the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns and changes in the way people work and consume; and (3) the scope and magnitude of the policy support granted.

Job retention schemes (JRS) were one important part of the policy response and could be a reason for differing productivity developments during the pandemic, depending on whether productivity is measured per employee or per hour worked. Job retention schemes set incentives to keep workers employed by their firms, even if they worked fewer hours. This enabled firms to adjust to the shock by reducing working time rather than laying people off. As a result, productivity in 2020 increased if measured as GDP per hour worked and declined if measured as GDP per employee (Chart 1). The analysis in this article, based on firm-level data, will focus on labour productivity measured as output per employee, given the lack of information on hours worked at the firm level.

The decline in productivity per employee in 2020 was driven by the strong decline in within-firm productivity growth. Chart 2 decomposes sectoral labour productivity growth in selected euro area countries between 2019 and 2020 into the contributions of the within-firm component and the reallocation of labour across firms in the sector (between-firm component). In most countries there was a strong decline in within-firm productivity growth. This reflects the effect of the reduced capital utilisation, the JRS and the consequent larger drop in output relative to the number of employees.

The pandemic and the related policies possibly inhibited but did not prevent the productivity-enhancing reallocation of resources across and within sectors. Crises can have a ""cleansing effect"", which is understood to be the disproportionate impact of adverse economic shocks on low productivity firms. The resulting reallocation of resources from low to high productivity firms can mitigate the negative productivity developments during busts caused by low capacity utilisation and labour hoarding. However, this reallocation process could have been altered during the pandemic because both low and high productivity firms operating in the most contact-intensive sectors were similarly affected. Also, the wide reach and vast magnitude of supporting measures to protect the corporate sector, both at the national and European levels, could have prevented the contraction and exit of low productivity firms and thereby inhibited the cleansing effect. Chart 2 shows that the contribution of the reallocation of resources across existing firms (between-firm component) was positive for productivity growth for the group of countries considered, and mitigated the aggregate decline in labour productivity in 2020. This means that low productivity firms contracted relatively more than their high productivity counterparts. In addition, Chart 3 below shows that relatively low productivity firms exited the market in 2020. Both pieces of evidence point to the pandemic having a cleansing effect. However, as will be shown, the cleansing effect was less pronounced than in other crises.

Less productive firms exited the market during the first year of the pandemic, contributing to the cleansing effect. Resources can also be reallocated across firms because of firm entry into, and exit from, the market. When less productive firms are substituted by new, more productive firms, firm dynamism is productivity-enhancing. As shown in Chart 3, the productivity distribution of firms that exited the market in 2020 was skewed to the left when compared with the productivity distribution of survivors in their sector. That is, firms exiting the market had on average lower productivity than incumbent firms, contributing to the productivity-enhancing reallocation of resources.

However, when the economy contracted sharply in 2020, fewer firms exited than in other crisis episodes, which mitigated the cleansing effect. To test if firm exits were different in 2020 to previous crises, the estimated historical reaction of firm exits to the decline in economic activity is compared with the dynamics observed during the acute phase of the pandemic in the five largest euro area economies. The results presented in Table 1 show that the pandemic reaction was much smaller than in previous crises: the correlation between firm exit and economic activity (-0.031) decreased to about -0.01 during the pandemic (as suggested by the sum of estimated coefficients: ‑0.031+0.024). This was the result of several factors, including bankruptcy freezes that resulted either from lockdowns that stalled administrative procedures or from policy decisions taken to avoid a wave of bankruptcies in some countries. The policy support to the corporate sector also contributed to fewer firms exiting, as shown below.

The rapid policy support provided to corporates and households prevented a wave of bankruptcies and preserved households' incomes. The support was thus a key factor behind the rapid economic recovery of the euro area economy following the pandemic-induced crisis. However, it is important to examine whether the unprecedented policy support during the pandemic had undesired impacts on aggregate productivity growth.

Firm-based evidence from several euro area countries suggests that policy support did not significantly distort resource reallocation across existing firms in 2020. In order to analyse the allocation of policy support across firms during the pandemic, it is necessary to merge data on a firm's characteristics with information on the support received by that firm in the form of subsidies, loan moratoria and guarantees. This merged dataset, available for six euro area countries, shows that firms in the middle of the productivity distribution had the highest probability of being supported in 2020 (Chart 4, dark blue line). In addition, the size of support increased with firm productivity. Therefore, at the onset of the crisis, policy support was not specifically allocated to low productivity firms and consequently did not contribute to the misallocation of resources.

However, the relative probability of low productivity firms receiving support increased significantly during the second year of the pandemic crisis. Highly productive firms exited the support schemes early in the pandemic. Therefore, during the second year of the pandemic, the probability of firms with low productivity receiving support increased compared with more productive firms in all countries that have available data (Chart 4, yellow line). Hence the allocation of subsidies became more distortionary over time, despite unchanged eligibility criteria.

Complementary analysis shows that, compared with other crises, the muted exit rate of firms in 2020 could to some extent be attributed to low productivity firms having large cash buffers (Chart 5). Low productivity firms, defined as those in the bottom half of the productivity distribution in each sector, enjoyed relatively healthy cash buffers in 2020. This could explain their greater capacity to stay in the market during the pandemic compared with other crises such as the global financial crisis (GFC). There could be different reasons for the healthier cash buffers. Firms may have had healthier balance sheets prior to the pandemic, or they may have benefited from fiscal support during the pandemic. To disentangle these factors, Chart 5 shows the cash holding distribution in 2020 (in red) and in 2009, the peak year of the GFC (in blue), and during the year preceding both crises (in light red and light blue). It is apparent that the cash buffers of low productivity firms in 2020 were higher than in 2009, and that the increase occurred in 2020, not in 2019. This suggests that support policies may have played a key role in the muted exit rate of firms in 2020.

Monetary policy also played a role in mitigating the adverse effects of the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing, it was not yet possible to quantify the impact of monetary policy on firm-level productivity growth as firm-level data were not yet available for the period following 2020/2021. However, an analysis of historical data can give some indication of the possible effects of monetary policy during the pandemic.In general, monetary policy has an impact on productivity by positively affecting the business cycle, but also by reducing financial frictions of relatively high productivity firms.

It is still too early to gauge the long-term consequences of the pandemic on productivity growth. Identifying the impacts is also difficult because other shocks with potentially large effects on productivity growth have hit the economy since the pandemic. This section highlights the main structural changes with a possible impact on productivity growth over the long term and leaves the precise quantification of their impact for future analysis, as data become available.

The pandemic and related lockdowns accelerated e-commerce and online shopping. Early on in the pandemic, deflated retail trade turnover dropped by approximately 20% (Chart 6, panel a). Online shopping, in contrast, increased sharply and was still approximately 30-40% above pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022. The impact of such a surge in online sales on productivity growth is not clear-cut and the effect differs across firm characteristics and other determinants. The literature has found that the spread of online platforms has had a positive impact on incumbent firms' productivity growth. These productivity gains are the result of increases in value added rather than reductions in employment, indicating that online platforms generate larger business opportunities.

In similar fashion, teleworking increased sharply in the spring of 2020 with the introduction of social distancing measures. The percentage of employees working frequently or occasionally from home increased sharply in 2020 and rose further to almost 25% in 2021 (Chart 6, panel b). The surge in teleworking may affect productivity growth through various channels. First, teleworking may lead to greater efficiency, thanks to the time saved on commuting, which partly translates into longer working hours. Second, it may result in a reduction in the stock of capital, especially real estate, needed by firms to operate. Third, teleworking has the potential to accelerate digitalisation. And fourth, teleworking may have an adverse impact on the way teams work together, as working from home is perceived by some to decrease interaction, team spirit and synergies among colleagues. The available data show that the negative productivity impacts of teleworking increase with teleworking intensity. For that reason, the literature suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of telework and worker efficiency, implying that productivity growth is maximised at moderate levels of teleworking. The exact form of this relationship likely varies with the relative importance of these factors by sector and by occupation.

The pandemic may have affected the labour force with longer-lasting scarring that extends beyond the acute phase. First, school shutdowns and disruptions to education during the pandemic may have had an impact on the human capital of future workers. Second, in the current workforce, pandemic containment measures and sharply reduced output may have raised unemployment rates, disrupted firm-worker relationships and potentially reduced skills and human capital. Finally, some people infected by COVID-19 may have acquired a chronic health condition that impairs their ability to work for a prolonged period.That said, job retention schemes and the provision of online schooling likely reduced the impact of the pandemic crisis on the labour force, and the return of the euro area labour force to its long-run pre-pandemic trend in 2023 argues against substantial permanent effects.

The ongoing digital and green transformations of the economy are high on the policy agenda in Europe. The NGEU funds support the adoption of greener technologies and the digitalisation of the economy, which have been accelerated by the pandemic and the recent increase in energy prices. This twin transition is expected to affect euro area productivity growth in the short and medium term. Furthermore, the ongoing development and spread of artificial intelligence (AI) in euro area economies gives rise to a host of opportunities and new challenges to exploit AI's productivity-enhancing potential. The EU Fit for 55 package was designed to accelerate the green transition, and along with the recent energy shock in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is altering the relative prices of the various energy inputs. Although the costs of the transition to a low-carbon economy will always be lower than inaction, it is important to understand how these changes affect the production decisions and performance of the corporate sector. Higher input costs from increasing energy and carbon prices are likely to dampen short-term productivity growth. This negative impact could be offset in the longer term by adopting new, greener and more digitally adept technologies.

The digital transition has become a policy priority for the European Union. Moreover, the pandemic has accelerated digitalisation. In addition, generative AI has been showcasing the potential - which is still to be seen - of new digital technologies to alter the ways in which people live and work.

One of the main reasons that the European Union has an interest in the digital transition is because of the productivity-enhancing potential of digitalisation. Digitalisation affects firm productivity growth through various channels. On the workers' side, the literature shows that the adoption of digital technologies leads to a boost in workers' efficiency by complementing their tasks, while non-core tasks are more likely to be outsourced after the arrival of the new technology. Various studies have also documented the impact of digitalisation on markets: digital technologies allow firms to grow quickly and achieve scale without mass, increase competitiveness and market size through the potential of e-commerce and access wider choices of imported goods.

Investing in digital technologies increases firm-level productivity. Firm-level data analysis from France and Austria shows that, after an adjustment period, firms that invested more in digital technologies enjoyed sustained and significantly higher productivity growth than firms that invested less in digital technologies (Chart 7). In the very short term, adopting these new technologies implies structural changes in the production process, which could be detrimental to productivity. Indeed, employment rates react faster than production because firms need to hire employees able to perform new tasks, such as IT jobs. This explains the initial drop in labour and, above all, total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the year of the technology investment.

However, the estimated effect of digital uptake on firm-level productivity in the two countries included in the analysis is small (Chart 7). The estimated reaction of firm productivity to the uptake of digital technology indicates that, on average, a 1% increase in investment in digital technologies would lead to a 0.06% increase in labour productivity and a 0.007% increase in TFP after six years. These estimates probably represent a lower bound for at least four reasons: (1) they are micro-based elasticities estimated at the firm level, which means that spillovers and general equilibrium effects are not included, although they can be important, as will be discussed below; (2) the data for the exercise refer to the period before the introduction of the latest generation of AI technologies, and in particular generative AI, which might have a higher productivity impact; (3) new digital technologies may require investment in the complementary skills of workers and managers, appropriate infrastructure and legal frameworks, and intangibles (e.g. data and software) to deliver full productivity benefits; and (4) the average impact masks heterogeneous impacts across sectors and across firms within the same sector.

Analysis using firm-level data for 13 euro area countries confirms that the productivity gains from digitalisation are highly heterogeneous across sectors and firms. The estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point higher digital investment intensity in a sector is associated with an acceleration the next year of roughly 0.02 percentage points in TFP growth of the average firm in that sector. Hence, the magnitude of the impact of digital investment seems rather small, corroborating the previous results for France and Austria. However, average impacts mask high heterogeneity across sectors: the impact in sectors able to benefit from digitalisation (blue and yellow dots in Chart 8, panel a) is 17 times larger than the average productivity impact estimated across all sectors.

Only the most productive firms benefit in terms of TFP growth from higher digital intensity (Chart 8, panel b). Only about 30% of firms, the most productive ones in the sector, manage to use new digital technologies in innovative and even disruptive ways to increase their productivity over time. Indeed, these firms already have internal processes that are highly productive, and digitalisation is another advantage that gives them a competitive edge. For other firms, digitalisation has no significant impact on their productivity.

However, aggregate impacts of digitalisation on productivity growth, after taking into account spillovers and general equilibrium effects, can be sizeable. To understand the importance of general equilibrium effects, a multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model calibrated for the four largest euro area economies is used. In this model, sectoral output is used not only for consumption or investment purposes, but also as an intermediate input to capture inter-sector linkages. Labour productivity growth resulting from observed TFP growth in each sector between 1997 and 2018 is compared with a counterfactual scenario in which TFP growth in digital sectors is set to zero from 1997; that is, a counterfactual with no digitalisation. It is found that in Germany and France, respective labour productivity growth would have been about 50% and 40% lower, respectively, in cumulative terms since 1997, without digitalisation-related efficiency increases. Aggregate labour productivity in Italy would have stagnated. Overall, the simulation results highlight the high impact of TFP growth in digital sectors - as a proxy for digitalisation - on aggregate labour productivity growth, and the importance of spillovers and general equilibrium effects.

Transition risks refer to the impacts of mitigation policies that are needed to achieve a greener society. Such policies, which implement carbon reduction objectives, lead to changes in the energy and industrial system and have impacts throughout the economy. For example, firms involved in fossil fuel production and those with a high emission intensity could face higher business costs and/or high costs to invest in carbon mitigating technologies. Also, higher prices of intermediate inputs can result in a notable rise in the production costs of less polluting firms. Overall, the entire economy will have to adjust.

A ""disorderly transition"" would reduce aggregate productivity over the long term. Green capital requires technological development and investment, which itself is a gradual process that depends on resource availability. The pace of the transition therefore matters. If carbon prices increase in a gradual and predictable manner (""orderly transition""), obsolete capital can be replaced with new green capital when it has depreciated. If the investment effort is uncertain, and transition policies unpredictable or pushed to the future, carbon prices will have to rise sharply to reach carbon neutrality (""disorderly transition""). This can result in substantial losses of capital, output and productivity in the long term.

While transition policies are aimed at greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, they can also have an impact on short- to medium-term productivity growth. There are multiple potential channels for this impact. First, transition policies can reduce the flexibility with which firms operate. Second, new green technologies might be less efficient than existing carbon-intensive ones. Third, investment in green technologies might crowd out other productivity-enhancing investment. Fourth, the green transition may result in the reallocation of resources from high-polluting sectors and firms to low-polluting sectors and firms, which might differ in their average productivity level. Fifth, higher investment in green technologies and innovation could have a positive impact on aggregate productivity growth over the long term. Sixth, the green transition could affect the skill composition of the labour force, with a possible bearing on aggregate productivity growth.

Observed changes in firm productivity may be partly a measurement issue. Carbon-intensive technologies currently underestimate their climate change impact in productivity calculations. This is because environmental degradation and the increased risk of climate-related disasters are not included as costs in traditional accounting frameworks. Therefore, green technology that avoids these unaccounted costs may only appear less productive. Similarly, capital put in place solely to abate carbon emissions does not have a measured output. If carbon abatement is achieved by adding a step (e.g. carbon capture) to the existing production process, there is, by definition, a need for more capital and inputs to reach the same measured output. Assessing productivity based on GDP per employee or per hour worked falls short in capturing the full benefits of embracing green technology. This limitation becomes evident, particularly as these metrics fail to account for the relevant counterfactual scenario of a probable escalation in climate-related physical risks.

A potential positive aspect of the green transition is that an increase in investments in green innovations and technologies could lift productivity growth over the medium to long term. This is known as the Porter hypothesis. The ""strong"" version of the Porter hypothesis states that increases in environmental regulation stringency raise overall productivity, while the ""weak"" version holds that optimally designed environmental regulation spurs innovation. A third, ""narrow"" version predicts market-based tools to be more effective in boosting innovation than ""command-and-control"" policies. Although there are many empirical analyses that test the validity of the versions of the Porter hypothesis, results remain inconclusive.

Firm-level data from six euro area countries have been used to test the Porter hypothesis. Results show that the productivity growth of high-polluting firms declines as environmental policy becomes more stringent. The impact can be relatively large: a one standard deviation tightening of the regulation decreases TFP growth by about one-third over five years. However, the impacts are different across policy types. Technology support policies (green R&D subsidies) only have a short-term negative effect in a transition period before boosting TFP growth. In contrast, market policies - for example, the Emissions Trading System or taxes - have persistent and negative, albeit quantitatively small, effects. Conversely, non-market tools such as emission limits reduce TFP growth the most over the horizon of five years. Compared with market-based policies, the significant negative impacts of non-market policies on TFP could result from their more discretionary nature.

More stringent environmental policies increase the amount of green patent applications from polluting firms (Chart 9, panel a). Moreover, the increase in investment in green innovation does not crowd out other types of innovations, as shown by the non-significant impact of more stringent policies on other non-green patent applications (Chart 9, panel b). These results confirm the weak version of the Porter hypothesis, which states that stringent environmental policy can increase overall innovation.

The analysis shows that market-based instruments, such as carbon taxes, are necessary but not sufficient to spur investment in green innovation and productivity growth. The green transition also requires stepping up green R&D efforts and non-market policies such as standards and regulations. Similarly, survey-based evidence shows that other factors related to reputational risks and demand are also important in driving corporate green performance.

The impact of environmental policies on TFP growth varies across firms. Firm-level data on the same six euro area countries show that small firms bear significantly higher TFP growth costs than large firms when environmental policy becomes tighter. This difference is shown to reflect, among other things, the capacity of large firms to access the required financial resources to successfully replace carbon-intensive capital.

Climate-driven reallocation of resources may also affect aggregate productivity growth. Emission reduction can be achieved by incentivising the adoption of greener technologies and through green reallocation, i.e. by shifting economic activity away from the most polluting firms towards the least polluting ones. The impact of green reallocation on aggregate productivity depends on the productivity of carbon-intensive sectors and firms compared with that of their greener counterparts.

High carbon-intensive sectors are, on average, relatively more productive than greener ones. Sectors such as mining and refineries are expected to shrink due to increasing relative prices and have a higher level of labour productivity than sectors that are involved in making buildings more energy-efficient and are expected to grow. Therefore, the reallocation of production factors across sectors during the green transition will mechanically, at current productivity levels, decrease aggregate productivity.

The effects of within-sector reallocation of resources are less clear and vary across sectors. Firm-level carbon intensity and labour productivity are not necessarily correlated. Therefore, reallocating output from high to low carbon-intensive firms does not necessarily lead to increased productivity. Firm-level information from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) for the period 2005-2020 shows that in the majority of sectors, the most carbon-efficient firms are also the most productive ones. At current firm-level productivity levels, reallocation of output towards greener firms will result in increases in labour productivity growth in those sectors, all other things being equal. However, for other sectors such as pulp, paper and ferrous metals, the contrary is the case, and the reallocation will be productivity-decreasing (Chart 10, panel a).

Reallocation of factors of production within firms away from energy may lead to lower productivity. Models that include energy in the production function show that higher energy prices can result in firms substituting away from energy and increasing their use of capital and labour. Due to diminishing marginal returns, the overall impact would be lower productivity and output. Indeed, recent OECD work estimates that a 5% increase in energy prices leads to firm productivity dropping by approximately 0.4% one year later as a result of the downward adjustment of the firm's capacity utilisation. The firms most affected are those operating in energy-intensive sectors, as well as firms that are financially constrained.

Over the past few years, the euro area economy has been hit by a series of shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the energy shock following Russia's invasion of Ukraine have interacted with other current structural trends, including the ongoing green and digital transitions. The overall impact of these shocks on the medium-term productivity prospects of the euro area is uncertain and varies depending on the time horizon.

The generous and swift policy responses at the national and European levels to the pandemic and the related lockdown measures helped to contain the size and duration of scarring effects on households and firms. Although productivity-enhancing reallocation of resources was not severely distorted in 2020, the pandemic and the policy support reduced the cleansing effect of the crisis compared with previous crises.

The pandemic accelerated the digitalisation of the economy and NGEU funds provided support in this regard. Digital adoption by corporates has been shown to foster productivity growth. However, firm-level impacts of digitalisation have been relatively modest to date. One of the main reasons for this is that only few firms - the ones closer to the technology frontier - have benefited most from digitalisation. Other firms need to invest more in relevant digital skills and complementary intangibles to fully reap the productivity gains from digitalisation. This process will only be reflected in aggregate productivity gains over the longer term.

The green transition may still boost productivity growth, but it will take time. In the short to medium term, the adjustment of firms to the change in relative input prices driven by carbon taxes or by geopolitical tensions, in addition to new limits and standards, and the scrapping of carbon-intensive capital, will reduce emissions as intended but is also likely to reduce productivity growth. Also, the reallocation of resources away from carbon-intensive sectors and firms might have a negative short-term impact on productivity. However, more stringent environmental policies are expected to trigger a new wave of green innovation and new environmental technologies that raise productivity growth over the long term.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,-0.003921568627450966,448984704,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?0ef1632c35edede913681bb76af694a4,

During the initial three quarters of the present fiscal year, the combined profit of all 12 PSBs amounted to Rs 98,000 crore which is merely Rs 7,000 crore less than their total profit for the entire fiscal year of FY23.

During FY23, PSBs achieved their highest-ever combined net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore, surpassing the Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in the fiscal year 2021-22. Consequently, the government received a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, marking a 58 per cent increase from the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous fiscal year.

The profit in the current financial year is expected to exceed that of the previous year. Hence, the dividend payout to the government will also be higher, as per the sources. Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added. (Also Read: Over 447 Million Dollars In Funding Raised By 22 Indian Startups Last Week)

Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends. As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends.

The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards. The draft lays down directions that need to be followed by banks' boards while considering proposals of dividend payouts, which include consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs as well.

A commercial bank should have a minimum total capital adequacy of 11.5 per cent to be eligible for declaring dividends, the circular said.

Amid an onslaught of grim climate news, China's recent decision to pursue a faster green transition is a rare bright spot. In early March, at the annual National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang announced that the country would accelerate investment in clean-energy projects. The plan is for a ""new trio"" of industries - solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and lithium batteries - to drive economic growth, replacing the ""old trio"" of clothing, furniture, and appliances. Although investment in the targeted industries will not be enough to reverse the country's ongoing economic slowdown, the West should appreciate the implications of Li's announcement.

A global green transition is already well under way; at this stage, countries and firms are largely on board with the shift to clean energy. According to the International Energy Agency, annual additions to renewable capacity increased by nearly 50 per cent in 2023, to 507 gigawatts, the fastest growth rate in the past two decades. The European Union, the United States, and Brazil, in particular, installed record amounts of renewable-energy capacity. But China experienced the largest growth by far, commissioning as much solar PV in 2023 as the entire world did in 2022, and increasing its wind capacity by 66 per cent year on year.

China's decision to ramp up spending could further accelerate this epochal shift and help achieve long-term climate goals by bringing forward the peak in fossil-fuel use and lowering greenhouse-gas emissions. Moreover, it suggests that place-based industrial policies are facilitating, not impeding, decarbonisation. US President Joe Biden ushered the world into a new era of industrial policy when he passed his $800 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes $391 billion in energy and climate spending, and his $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). This strategy pushed the EU to implement its own raft of green subsidies. And now, China is addressing its economic woes by channeling even more resources into decarbonisation.

At the same time, an increased supply of low-cost green products from China - a likely outcome of the country's bet on emerging technologies - would not flow to the US, owing to its embrace of industrial policy. The US government has already imposed tariffs on strategic Chinese imports. And with the IRA and the BIL pumping massive sums into domestic clean-energy manufacturing and deployment, the Biden administration is considering new protectionist measures to prevent China from undercutting the US market.

This is frustrating for ardent advocates of free trade, as it means that cheap Chinese solar panels, EVs, and batteries will not be available in America any time soon. A Donald Trump victory in November would only make things worse: the former president has proposed a staggering 60 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports.

Although the energy transition is coming at a high price for Americans, it is a price worth paying. By defending its domestic industries, the US government will likely divert Chinese products to other countries, especially in the developing world, which would allow consumers to buy clean-tech products at low prices. More importantly, if developing countries seize this opportunity, they could accelerate their own green transitions.

For example, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose plan for reaching net-zero emissions by 2070 is highly insufficient, should take advantage of China's green-tech surge. In the short term, that means using Chinese products to plug the gaps in India's clean-energy industry. Modi should also convince Chinese companies to build additional production facilities in India, which would facilitate technology transfer, create jobs, and lower the cost of green tech.

African leaders should likewise electrify their economies using China's green products and technologies. Just as many African countries have leapfrogged to mobile networks, skipping landline development, they must do the same with clean energy, bypassing fossil fuels. While certainly a challenge, such an approach is well-suited for a continent with abundant solar and wind resources and a need for distributed-energy solutions. Moreover, African countries with a large supply of rare earths should work with Chinese firms to move up the value chain and create more jobs.

Whenever CEOs and policymakers meet at climate conferences or in Davos, a common refrain is that the green transition must be just. That would require $1 trillion in annual clean-energy investment in low- and middle-income countries - a seven-fold increase from current levels. While there is a desperate need for more financing, China's increased investment in clean energy could be an important part of the solution.

Ultimately, China and the US (as well as the EU) must reach an agreement on what constitutes fair and free trade of green goods. But in the meantime, given the existential imperative to achieve net-zero emissions, we should welcome China's investment plans, even as we worry about their implications for US industry. For now, I can drive an American-made EV from Ford or Tesla, but I hope one day to have the option of purchasing an EV built by China's BYD. Either way, I will be on the road to a less polluting future. @Project Syndicate, 2024

This warehouse will be provided by an independent party or parties external to the Eurosystem and be able to process, verify and transmit ABS loan-level data. The warehouse will ensure that the data is made available to the market and, in this way, it will increase the transparency of existing ABS transactions. The infrastructure will also comprise the processes and systems necessary for counterparties to submit the loan-level data electronically. This data should be checked for compliance with the specific requirements, as well as for accuracy, consistency and timeliness.

In April 2011 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) indicated in aletter of intent the Eurosystem's intention to make use of such a data warehouse. The Eurosystem intends to become a client of the data warehouse on a non-exclusive basis once ABS loan-level data requirements become an ECB collateral eligibility criterion, provided that the data warehouse complies with certain technical specifications.

An independent market-driven initiative to establish the data warehouse got under way in April 2011 under the auspices of the Market Group.

As a result, the European DataWarehouse GmbH (ED) was created at the end of June 2012 to provide the data-handling infrastructure for the ABS market. The ED becomes operational in January 2013 with the start of the loan level reporting requirements for RMBS and SME ABS.

Highlighting the potential to generate more employment opportunities and enhance social protection measures for citizens, President Hichilema emphasized the importance of strategic partnerships in driving progress.

In expressing gratitude for the support received, President Hichilema extended appreciation to His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and acknowledged the stewardship of Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of IHC (International Holding Company). This recognition comes in light of their instrumental roles in ensuring the success of the investment in Mopani.

President Hichilema emphasized the collective efforts aimed at creating meaningful change within the mining sector, with a vision to benefit not only the present generation but also future ones. The collaborative approach, coupled with innovative strategies, is expected to pave the way for sustainable growth and development, ultimately enriching both Zambia and partner countries for generations to come.

The President's remarks signify a commitment to leveraging partnerships and embracing innovation as key drivers of progress in Zambia's mining industry.

Meanwhile in a bid to bolster rural household food security and promote environmentally friendly agricultural practices, over 10,000 beneficiary farmers across five districts in Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia are poised to benefit from crop grain seed banks established in various farmer field schools.

William Funsani, Senior Agricultural Research Officer at the Zambia Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI), highlighted the pivotal role of these initiatives in enhancing food security among rural communities. Funsani noted that farmers have been actively engaged in adopting smart agricultural practices aimed at bolstering food security while being environmentally conscious.

The districts identified for support in promoting climate-resilient crops include Gwembe, Sinazongwe, Choma, Kazungula, and Sesheke. Funsani elaborated on the target crop value chains, which encompass a range of climate-resilient crops such as cowpeas, groundnuts, sorghum, pearl millet, sweet potatoes, and cassava. These efforts are geared towards not only diversifying agricultural production but also ensuring resilience against climatic uncertainties.

The establishment of rural household crop grain seed banks serves as a practical measure to empower local farmers with access to quality seeds, thereby enhancing their capacity to withstand environmental challenges and improve yields. By promoting the cultivation of climate-resilient crops, the initiative seeks to fortify food security at the grassroots level, contributing to the overall well-being of rural communities.

The engagement of farmers in farmer field schools underscores a participatory approach to agricultural extension, facilitating knowledge exchange and skill-building in sustainable farming practices. Through these collaborative efforts between agricultural research institutions and local communities, Zambia endeavors to foster resilience and prosperity in its agricultural sector while addressing the pressing issue of food insecurity.",lusakatimes.com,news,LusakaTimes.com,,0.7176470588235293,448984509,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.lusakatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hh-mopani-partners.jpg,

New leaks hint at the highest HP pool ever in Genshin Impact 4.6 Spiral Abyss Floor 12

HomDGCat recently leaked the enemy lineup for the upcoming Spiral Abyss cycle in Genshin Impact 4.6 on Reddit and shared the changes made in the third chamber of Floor 12.

Previously, there were only three waves in the first half of Chamber III, featuring Fatui mobs and Abyss enemies. However, according to the latest leaks, all of them will replaced with other mobs, such as Eremite and Clockwork Mekas. Additionally, one more enemy wave will supposedly be added to this chamber.

This will reportedly result in a significant increase in the number of enemies, which will also increase the total HP pool of both halves of Floor 12 Chamber III in the Spiral Abyss to almost six million.

On a related note, it is worth highlighting that HomDGCat mentioned ""12-3 HP close to 4 million"" on the Reddit post above. This can be slightly misleading since that number is only for the first half of the third chamber and does not include the Iniquitous Baptist's 1.38 million HP in the second half.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",bangordailynews.com,news,Bangor Daily News,Associated Press,-0.05098039215686279,448984434,1,https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/preview-716.jpg?fit=512%2C384&ssl=1,

Shohei Ohtani's offseason was eventful enough when he got married, signed a $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and adopted a puppy. He could've done without the added drama of Ippei Mizuhara, his longtime interpreter and confidant, using $4.5 million of his money to pay off illegal sports gambling debts.

What we know about the situation is that $4.5 million in wire transfers was sent to Mathew Bowyer, who is under federal investigation for allegedly running an illegal bookmaking operation, to cover Mizuhara's debts. The Dodgers fired Mizuhara on Wednesday.

On Friday, ESPN's Tisha Thompson wrote a blow-by-blow timeline of all the events known to the public so far. At 10:30 pm on Tuesday, Mizuhara told ESPN, ""After Ohtani agreed to pay the debts, the two of them logged into Ohtani's bank account on Ohtani's computer and sent eight or nine transactions, each at $500,000, over several months.""

This would make Ohtani complicit, to some degree, in making the payments. However, Ohtani's lawyers released a conflicting statement the next day: ""In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.""

Mizuhara himself changed his story Wednesday afternoon. In a phone call with ESPN, ""He says he had lied in his previous interview and walks back much of what he had said. He tells ESPN Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activities, debts or efforts to repay them.""

Mizuhara is obviously in deep legal trouble no matter what. The question everyone wants answered is whether Ohtani was aware and consenting to paying off Bowyer. When Mizuhara recanted his previous story and claimed it was all his own fault, ESPN's reporter asked him if he took the money from the account without Ohtani's knowledge.

There was no response.

At this point in the story's development, it's going to become impossible to get direct information from any of the involved parties that doesn't go through lawyers and official spokespeople. Ohtani's legal team claims he is the victim of theft and had no knowledge of the missing money until this week. That may or may not be true, but it's conveniently the only scenario in which he remains blameless.

MLB has launched its own investigation into the matter, which they announced after the business day ended on Friday evening. Ohtani is the face of baseball on two continents. He's the game's biggest attraction, highest-paid player, and reigning AL MVP. The league would love this scandal to blow over as quietly as possible, but given its magnitude and potential consequences, it's doubtful they'll get their wish.

According to MLB Rule 21 (d)(3), ""Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee who places bets with illegal book makers, or agents for illegal book makers, shall be subject to such penalty as the Commissioner deems appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances of the conduct.""

If Ohtani knowingly sent money to Bowyer, as Mizuhara originally claimed, it would seem he is in violation of the rule. He would be subject to discipline at Rob Manfred's discretion, which could come in the form of a fine and/or suspension.

The last MLB player found to have violated Rule 21 (d)(3) was Miami Marlins pitcher Jarred Cosart in 2015. He was fined but not suspended for making bets with an illegal bookmaker on sports other than baseball. Using that precedent, Ohtani would probably avoid a suspension for knowingly covering Mizuhara's debts to Bowyer.

Did he know about and participate in the wire transfers though?

Financial institutions typically have a limit on wire transfer amounts. They can extend or lift the limit for account holders, presumably with a lot of identification checks and paperwork. They're also required to file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as per the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. According to FinCEN's CTR Reference Guide, ""To comply with this law, financial institutions must obtain personal identification information about the individual conducting the transaction such as a Social Security number as well as a driver's license or other government issued document.""

If Ohtani was truly unaware of wire transfers totaling $4.5 million until a few days ago, Mizuhara would likely face added charges involving fraud and identity theft. He would've needed to have stolen or forged Ohtani's legal documentation.

That's certainly possible because they had a close relationship and Mizuhara could've had access to those documents, but it seems highly unlikely. Sending such a large sum through wire transfers from someone else's account without their knowledge until several months later is nearly impossible. If nothing else, one would hope Ohtani checks his account balance more often than that. The simplest explanation is that Ohtani sent the money himself.

Once Mizuhara retains legal council and faces the possibility of additional legal charges, he may revert back to his earlier story that Ohtani sent the money on his behalf. Then it will be up to MLB and the government investigators to sort through conflicting accounts of what transpired.

The most likely story is the one Mizuhara original told, then recanted -- he asked his friend to help him out of a dangerous predicament, who then wired the money to Bowyer. The remaining questions will be whether or not that can be proven, and if so, what penalties Ohtani could face under the law and from MLB.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,-0.2156862745098039,448984387,1,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66002c606cd64490a34de93f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1577,1051,x0,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds",eng-9419378

Cyberattacks are a serious threat to each of us. Attackers could try to hack into a private computer or an organisation for economic gain or simply for demonstrative purposes, or they could be driven by the aim of causing damage and disruption.

This threat has to be taken seriously by banks, financial institutions, and financial market infrastructures (such as payment or settlement systems). But cyberattacks are not only a threat to individual institutions. Given the high level of interconnectedness within the financial sector, they can also pose a threat to the stability of the overall financial ecosystem.

The risk of cyberattacks is further accentuated by the high reliance of the financial system on digital technologies, the difficulty to protect against fast changing threats and because they are borderless.

It is therefore essential that banks, other financial institutions and financial market infrastructures, as well as central banks like the ECB, have an adequate level of cyber resilience to ensure their own protection as well as that of the entire ecosystem.

We work closely with all EU national central banks to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our own data. This helps to protect us and the Eurosystem as a whole against cyberattacks, limit the fallout in case of a data breach and ensure that we can continue to operate at all times.

We work with other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The EU Computer Emergency Response Team - or CERT-EU for short - is the centre point of these joint efforts. CERT-EU warns its members about new threats, provides testing and offers advisory services. It also supports its members when responding to cyberattacks. The response team is hosted by the Commission and financed by the participating institutions.

We work with national cyber security authorities such as the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik - BSI). As the federal cyber security authority, BSI shapes information security in digitalisation for the Government, business and society through prevention, detection and reaction. Our strong and trusted relationship with BSI enables cooperation in areas of mutual importance and aids our joint goal of strengthening cyber resilience.

We facilitate exchanges of security information among a global network of central banks and international financial organisations.

One of the ECB's tasks is to oversee financial market infrastructures - for example payment and settlement systems - as they are essential to the smooth functioning of the financial system as a whole. We set rules and best practices with the aim of ensuring that these infrastructures have a high level of cyber resilience. As part of this, the ECB has developed a European framework for ethical hacking. A financial company or organisation can request an authorised hacker to attempt to hack its systems in line with the guidance provided in the framework in order to test their resilience and identify any weaknesses.

ECB Banking Supervision has implemented a cyber-incident reporting framework. All significant institutions from the 19 euro area countries are required to report significant cyber incidents within two hours of classifying the incident as significant. This enables our supervisors to identify and monitor trends in cyber incidents affecting significant institutions and to gain a deeper knowledge of the cyber threat landscape. It also puts us in a position to be able to react more swiftly to a potential crisis caused by a cyberattack.

ECB Banking Supervision monitors how the banks under our supervision manage their IT risks. Most aspects of cyber security fall under this part of our supervisory activities, which include:

Work is ongoing to issue guidelines on IT risk management (including cyber risk) for significant credit institutions.

We take part in bilateral meetings and international working groups with a variety of stakeholders (overseers, supervisors and institutions, both inside and outside the EU) to ensure a coordinated approach to cyber risk.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,0.02745098039215677,448984224,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?5609fefdb059590b375eafe2c236bf5c,

The results of our economy-wide climate stress test showed that if we act early, the cost of transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy will be much lower than the cost of inaction.

An orderly transition to a green economy is an opportunity for us all, including firms and financial institutions, to benefit from clean and cheaper energy, technological innovations and new business.

An orderly transition to a green economy would, in the long run, reduce climate-related risks for the entire economy and financial system, as well as for the inflation outlook and the assets on the Eurosystem balance sheet. As a result, it would contribute to long-term price and financial stability.

In line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the ECB has the obligation, within our mandate and without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability, to support general economic policies in the EU.

In this quest, you'll be helping a doctor named Zakariya who works in the Sumeru region. There are three variations of the quest, and in each one, Zakariya will ask you to deliver medicine to a different patient of his.

Aside from delivering medicines to the patients Gurgen, Azra, and Aftab, you can do more to aid these NPCs. Assisting them further will unlock a hidden achievement called Relaxation Therapy worth five Primogems.

Here is a guide on completing the Doctor's Orders daily commission in Genshin Impact and obtaining the associated achievement.

Doctor's Orders Genshin Impact commission guide: How to get Relaxation Therapy achievement

To start the Sumeru daily commission, Doctor's Orders, in Genshin Impact, you must interact with a doctor named Zakariya at the Bimarstan Hospital in Sumeru City. He will ask you to deliver medicines to any of his three patients.

After making the delivery, if you provide them with additional aid, you will unlock the Sumeru hidden achievement, Relaxation Therapy.

Let's take a look at what you must do for each patient.

Gurgen

Gurgen is located northwest of Bimarstand in his field, complaining about being too injured to remove the weeds that have grown.

After delivering Gurgen's medications, you must remove all the weeds from his field and talk to him again. Then, go back and report to Zakariya to complete the commission.

Azra

Azra, a skilled mercenary from the esteemed Corps of Thirty, is stationed near the entrance of the bustling Grand Bazaar. While handing out her medicines, Zakariya comments that she always complains about them being too bitter.

Therefore, after completing the objective, interact with Azra again and give her 1x Sugar. Then, report back to Zakariya to conclude the Doctor's Orders commission.

Aftab

During the commission, you can find Aftab across the street from Bimarstan. Like Azra, you need to interact with this NPC after giving him his medicines. You'll need to offer him 1x Delicious Steak here.

Afterward, return to Zakariya and report to him to complete the daily commission.

Helping out all three of these NPCs during each version of the Doctor's Orders daily commission will reward you with the hidden achievement of Relaxation Therapy.

""He's on a hot streak obviously, and just like people have slumps at times, people can go on these runs like this,"" Udoka said to reporters.

Jalen Green dropped 41 points, four rebounds, four assists and one steal against the Utah Jazz on Saturday. He almost matched his career-high 42 points yet again after matching it just four days prior against the Washington Wizards.

""Main thing is he stayed resilient and continued to be confident when things weren't going great,"" Udoka continued. ""All it takes for a really good score is to see a few go through, you know, run off a game or two of hot shooting and it can kind of snowball like this so like I said, I'm proud of the way he fought through some adversity.

""I've coached a lot of high-level scorers and this is right up there with them, the streak he's going on right now, it's not easy by any means regardless of who it is to drop 40 in the league consistently.""

In the past 10 games, Green has averaged 27.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.4 assists to lead the Rockets to nine wins. The Rockets are 35-35, 11th in the Western Conference and are fighting for a spot in the play-in tournament. With 12 games left in the regular season, they are 1.5 games behind the Golden State Warriors who are currently tenth in the Western Conference.

Jalen Green is soon to be a first-time father

Draya Michele (39), the girlfriend of Jalen Green (22), is in the third trimester of her pregnancy and announced the news of her soon-to-come girl baby on International Women's Day (March 8).

While Michele announced her pregnancy over two weeks ago, Green discussed it in an interview after the Houston Rockets' blowout win against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, in which he matched his career-high 42 points.

When asked what has driven him to be exceptional in recent games, putting up some of his best performances, the Rockets guard mentioned his ""family"" and his ""baby."" Green did not mention Michele by name, he acknowledged both his unborn child and the mother.

What are the chances for severe weather in Oklahoma on Sunday, March 24?

On Sunday afternoon and evening a powerful surface low ejects across the central plains. A dry line and cold front associated with this boundary will swing from the northwest to the southeast Sunday afternoon and evening with developing thunderstorms along the boundary.

The overlap of deep layer shear, surface instability, and moisture creates the potential for severe thunderstorms from western OK into southwestern and central Kansas during the late afternoon and nearing north central OK Sunday evening.

Thunderstorms will become likely late Sunday night moving across part of NE OK through pre-dawn Monday. Stronger dynamic energy will be lifting northeast during this time, but some strong to severe thunderstorms will remain possible near or west of Tulsa late Sunday evening.

As the front clears the area, showers should quickly exit the area Monday morning. The upper air trough continues nearby with colder air aloft moving across the state.

A surface high pressure ridge nearby brings unseasonably cold air with most locations near freezing Tuesday morning. Afternoon highs will remain in the mid-50s.

The next stronger system will quickly develop by the latter half of next week bringing another mention for strong to severe storms Friday followed by yet another robust cool-down Saturday.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change.

Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Prominent climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh.

He has been on a fast since the protests started on March 6, surviving only on salt and water in the open in sub-zero temperatures.

Temperatures have been as low as minus six degrees and snowing in recent days.

Mr Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a ""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers [in the region],"" Mr Wangchuk told The Associated Press.

He has been joined by about 200 other people sleeping under the open sky as part of the demonstration.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers -- which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world"" -- are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people.

The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military stand-off between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in [the] making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Mr Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment.

The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Mr Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood and for local legislature to be able to frame their own laws on land and agriculture.

The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Mr Wangchuk recently posted on X.

""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh and continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

In Iberdrola's updated three-year business plan, the veteran executive chairman of Europe's largest utility has earmarked 36 billion euros of net investments by 2026. Most of the cash will go into upgrading and expanding ageing power grids, and about a third into the United States. Both are perceived as safer investment options than the renewable projects on which the $79 billion company has largely built its stock market fortune.

In the past decade, Iberdrola has trebled its market worth. That's chiefly thanks to an early push into wind and solar projects. Even though Iberdrola has done a better job than peers weathering the Covid-19 pandemic and Europe's 2022 energy shock, investors' enthusiasm towards green power investments has cooled. Higher interest rates have made many projects less profitable, especially in offshore wind. Shares in Denmark's Orsted have fallen about 70% from their January 2021 peak after multiple headaches.

That said, Iberdrola shares trade roughly where they stood at that point in time. Given that some of that is down to a pre-existing mix of US exposure and regulated assets, Galán's new investment targets should cement the group's appeal. He is allocating 60% of net capital expenditure, or 21.5 billion euros, to power grids. That's up from 44% in a previous plan, or 16 billion euros. These networks need massive upgrades and changes as ditching fossil fuels requires more electricity. But as regulated businesses, grids also offer more predictable returns as investors receive a guaranteed rate over the lifetime of the asset.

The other key focus for Iberdrola is the United States. The Spanish company admittedly had to abandon its $8 billion takeover of US PNM Resources in January due to regulatory pushbacks. But its $2.5 billion offer to buy, opens new tab out the 18% of $14 billion US unit Avangrid it does not already own shows a steady commitment to that market. The generous subsidies President Joe Biden's administration is handing out for both renewables and infrastructure make the investment worth it.

The International Energy Agency calculates US subsidies exceed, opens new tab those of other countries, and it has earmarked $50 billion just for electricity networks. Also, by 2035, the US may need investments of $1 trillion in distribution networks and up to $500 billion in transmission lines, according to an IMPAX Asset Management report.

Shareholders seem comfortable that Galán can hit the top end of his targeted range for 2026 EBITDA, of 16.5 billion euros to 17 billion euros. Apply a 2026 EBITDA multiple of 7, roughly in line with a Morgan Stanley-compiled average of rivals like Enel and EDP for that year, and Iberdrola should be worth around 120 billion euros, including debt - where it currently trades.

Galán's strategy is not without risks of its own. Biden's handouts are inflating construction costs, and presidential hopeful Donald Trump has threatened to axe some green tax credits. Still, with US power networks required to expand by two-thirds to handle surging electricity demand, the Iberdrola boss's bets look reassuringly logical. -- Reuters

This is because FMIs can be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and credit losses, or, given the high level of interconnectivity, a major channel through which these shocks can be transmitted across domestic and international markets, putting financial stability at risk.

The threat of cyberattacks is further accentuated by their dynamic, evolving nature and because they are borderless. It is therefore essential that financial institutions and FMIs have an adequate level of cyber resilience to ensure their own safety as well as that of the entire ecosystem.

The ECB is responsible for overseeing a number of systemically important payment systems (SIPS) operating in the euro area. As these systems clear and settle payments across Europe, they are fundamental to the smooth functioning of the financial markets in the euro area.

As an overseer, the ECB needs to ensure that not only the individual SIPS have a strong level of cyber resilience, but the financial ecosystem as a whole is resilient against cyber threats.

A significant amount of work has been undertaken internationally with regard to cyber risk and FMIs. In June 2016, the CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures was published, providing FMIs with guidance on how to establish and operationalise a cyber resilience framework.

At the G7 level, the G7 Cyber Expert Group (G7 CEG) - of which the ECB is a member - is actively focusing on cybersecurity risks for the financial sector. Established in November 2015, the G7 CEG aims to identify and develop fundamental elements of cybersecurity in order to help financial entities address the risk of cyberattacks. The G7 CEG has published the following fundamental elements, representing a major step forward in this field:

In terms of legislation, the European Commission adopted the Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) in July 2016, which contains legal measures and incentives aimed at making the EU's online environment secure by strengthening preparedness, cross-border cooperation, cyber incident reporting and information exchange.

These initiatives all provide the basis for our work at the ECB and across the Eurosystem.

In March 2017 the Governing Council approved the ""Eurosystem cyber resilience strategy for FMIs"". The objective of this strategy is to improve the cyber resilience of the euro area financial sector as a whole by enhancing the ""cyber readiness"" of individual FMIs that are overseen by the Eurosystem central banks, and to foster collaboration among FMIs, their critical service suppliers and the authorities. Specifically, the strategy aims to put the CPMI-IOSCO guidance into practice and comprises three pillars.

The evolving nature of cyberattacks makes it necessary to ensure that payment systems strengthen their individual level of cyber maturity.

Pillar 1 aims to ensure that the CPMI-IOSCO guidance is put into practice in a consistent manner, by implementing a harmonised approach to assessing payment systems in the euro area against the guidance. In addition, the Eurosystem is developing a range of tools that can be used by FMIs to enhance their cyber resilience.

One of these tools is a European red team testing framework, which gives guidance on how to carry out ""friendly attacks"" that mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of real attackers, based on bespoke threat intelligence. These friendly attacks target the processes, technologies and staff of an FMI, without prior warning, in order to test its protection, detection and response capabilities.

Overseers will also use other tools, such as cyber surveys and focused assessments, to assess the level of cyber maturity of Eurosystem payment systems and to develop cyber resilience oversight expectations to provide more detailed guidance to payment system operators.

Given the high degree of interconnectedness in the ecosystem, an FMI depends not only on its own readiness, but also on that of its participants, service providers and interconnected FMIs. Subsequently, it is essential that there is a high level of cyber resilience across the ecosystem as a whole.

Pillar 2 focuses on strengthening the sector's cyber resilience, by understanding the operational interdependencies through sector mapping, fostering cross-border and cross-authority collaboration, establishing effective information-sharing and implementing market-wide business continuity exercises.

To address the growing threat of cyber risk, it is imperative to ensure collaboration among all relevant participants, both regulators and market participants, in a trusted environment.

Pillar 3 aims to ensure regular pan-European cyber forums take place with Board-level participation by regulators and market participants. In this vein, the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for Pan-European Financial Infrastructures has been established.

Of all the rivalries in the history of bodybuilding, Phil Heath and Kai Greene's complex relationship enamored fitness enthusiasts. The duo locked horns at several events, including Mr. Olympia championships and Arnold Classic events.

What weeded them out amongst other popular rivals was how their bitterness trailed off-stage. However, in recent years, they've often joked around about it. Phil Heath addressed their camaraderie in Bradley Martyn's podcast.

Talking about his competitors from the past, Heath addressed where he stood on his views about Greene. Amongst other frequently asked questions, one of the burning controversies was if their onstage tiff was real.

Speaking to Martyn about it, Heath recalled how fans would freak out seeing him and Greene workout together. That's when people began realizing that their beef might be limited to the stage. However, due to their public confrontations, Martyn pressed for details on the complexity of it all.

Heath admitted that while they didn't have any bad blood, fans from both sides pitted against each other, boosting the rivalry to the real world. Comparing their tiff to the likes of high school teens, he revealed how there were hints of misunderstanding through the public word. Yet, in the case of Greene's angst against him, Heath confessed that he empathized with him.

""I also knew that I was standing in his way...and I have to acknowledge someone's angst, someone's, you know, anger toward someone.""

Heath had won the Olympia seven times in a row, where he competed against Greene in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Throughout these years, the latter came close to winning the Sandow. Many rooted for him due to his humongous build and ripped muscles. Yet, Heath had a differing opinion.

""He could've beat me in 2014 if he didn't start that fight. I think he would have gotten some points on Friday, where it would've been even going into Saturday.""

The infamous spat between the two icons in 2014 caused a lot of drama in the bodybuilding world. Ever since then, Greene gradually backed away from the championship even though he never announced a formal retirement. Yet, today, both stay on cordial terms, and he even made an appearance on Heath's upcoming documentary.

Amidst several bodybuilding events and shows, Heath gave the fitness world one more reason to celebrate with his documentary - Breaking Olympia: The Phil Heath Story. He recently held a premiere with several stars in attendance.

Of all the bodybuilding celebrities to grace the occasion, yesteryear icon Jay Cutler was present to support his colleague. Coach Hany Rambod accompanied Mr. Olympia icon Hadi Choopan for the movie.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilder son Joseph Baena was also present and put up an Instagram story congratulating Heath on the significant milestone.

Bodies and minds are just as affected by climate change as sea ice and forests, says University of Alberta scientist Sherilee Harper.

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""",castanet.net,news,Castanet,,0.03529411764705892,448983598,1,https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/3/20230824160856-64e7c44eed396cb8e05db7bbjpeg_p3715977_p3716476_p3774706.jpg,eng-9418126

The workshop on the topic 'Forests for Water: For prosperity and peace' had experts from various fields present papers.

The Himalayas, Western Ghats as well as the country's coastal belt will be hugely affected by climate change. This will lead to shortage of water and increase in heat. Climate change will also affect the ecosystem of the forest areas, observed the workshop.

Though the total availability of rains has not decreased in Kerala, there is decline in the number of rainy days. This has reduced the water level in the rivers and wells.

Rain deficit

The State government is taking serious steps to overcome the challenge, noted the experts who spoke at the workshop.

Studies have also observed that the availability of water has reduced in the forests. There are efforts to make small ponds in the forests. Comparatively better water availability in Kerala's forests is attracting wild animals from neighbouring states. This also contributes to the increasing man-animal conflict, they observed.

Tamil Nadu former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Dr. N. Krishnakumar inaugurated the workshop.

As key contributors to the national grid, he said, their instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation.

The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy, he stated.

""It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation,"" Mr Apetorgbor said in a statement.

Below is his full statement...

The past four years of the energy sector have faced significant challenges, marked by a lack of clear direction and oversight. This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply. Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardized not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the last hour of June 30, 2023 to save the situation.

Recognizing the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

While the Ministry of Energy's absence was a glaring gap, the empathy and resilience shown by the ECG's Managing Director is a demonstration of effective leadership, competence and has indeed saved the power sector.

During an interview on The Big Issue on Citi TV, Mr Cudjoe expressed fear that the impasse between the executive and the legislature could adversely impact the economy.

""We are economically saddled, if we don't talk about gay issues won't we eat? My only worry is that the impasse could have certain tolls on the economy and the governance process. But indeed, we should learn and be wiser out of this particular care, if we manage to get through to it,"" he pointed out.

He emphasized the need for the government to ensure that the impact of the impasse on citizens is mitigated.

""The economy, the impacts on individual rights and indeed anything that we thought may be impacted by this particular anti-gay bill.

""When we heard that the finance minister wrote a letter to the President saying to stay your hands because this may have implications economically, I worried, because I asked myself what were the considerations.""

Ahmadu said this at the just concluded 2nd Annual Assembly and International Welding Federation Africa Conference held at Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, with the theme: 'Materials Manufacturing Technologies: Managing Capacity Africa.'

He said that by harnessing the collective talents and energies of our people, we can unlock the full potentials of the welding sector and drive sustainable development across the continent.

""The Nigerian government is committed to working hand-in-hand with Welding Federation Africa to achieve these goals. We are actively exploring partnerships to modernise our welding training facilities, develop an industry-aligned curriculum, and establish an international certification programme. We believe that by working together we can empower a new generation of African welders to build a brighter future for our continent.""

He further stressed that President Bola Tinubu whose Renewed Hope Agenda recognised the critical importance of the welding industry: His policy initiatives focused on modernising training facilities, fostering industry collaboration, and promoting skilled workforce development, align perfectly with our national aspirations.

He however noted that challenges persist as demand for skilled welders across Africa continues to outpace supply.

Ahmadu posited that to bridge this gap, we must empower institutions like the esteemed Metallurgical Training Institute (MTI) in Onitsha and similar institutions, providing them with the resources and partnerships necessary to adapt their programmes to evolving industry needs and equip the next generation of welder's professionals.

Earlier, in his words, the Chairman of Dorman Long Engineering Limited, Dr Timi Austen-Peters called for more training and greater opportunities by the government for players in the building and construction companies across the country.

Austen-Peters, who noted that the company has trained well over 300 welders, and we are proud to give them gainful employment, stated that providing proper training opportunities for welders is a catalyst for growth in the sector.

On his part, the Chairman at Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN), Mr. Nicolas Odinuwe has called for unifying certificates within Africa especially in the welding and manufacturing sector.

Dividend payouts: Public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to dispense a dividend in excess of Rs 15,000 crore for the March 2024 fiscal as a result of enhanced profitability, as per sources.

All 12 PSBs in the initial three quarters of the present financial year garnered a total profit of Rs 98,000 crore which is only Rs 7,000 crore short of the whole of FY23.

PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 as against Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

Consequently, the government earned a 58 per cent higher dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, more than the Rs 8,718 crore allocated in the preceding financial year.

The dividend payout to the government will also be higher as the profit in the current financial year would be much greater than the last year, as per the sources.

Considering past records, the dividend payout for FY24 should exceed Rs 15,000 crore, they added.

In January this year, the Reserve Bank's draft guidelines put forth for such banks to declare dividends, who had a net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent.

The pre-existing norms which were last updated in 2005 mandated for banks to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent in order to be eligible for declaring dividends.

The new guidelines should be in effect from FY25 onwards, the central bank proposed.

According to the draft, the boards of banks need to follow directions including consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs, while considering proposals of dividend payouts.

It is required for a commercial bank to have a minimum total capital adequacy of 11.5 per cent for being eligible to declare dividends, as per the circular.

Summary

John Stewart will debut in the DCU's Lanterns series. Potential actors include John David Washington, Aldis Hodge, and Jovan Adepo. The DC Universe reboot has already cast its first Green Lantern, with Nathan Fillion playing Guy Gardner.

The John Stewart version of Green Lantern has been confirmed to be part of the new DC Universe, and there are a few exciting options for who could bring the popular DC hero to life. The DCEU failed the Green Lanterns, with the space cops having little more than an unnamed Lantern appear as a cameo in 2017's Justice League. Based on the Green Lantern Corps' lore and its members, a movie about one or more of Earth's Green Lanterns would have had the potential to become one of the DCEU's best films.

Director Zack Snyder cast the Green Lantern John Stewart for his Justice League, with Wayne T. Carr in the role. The character was meant to appear in the final scene of Zack Snyder's Justice League, with the director shooting Carr's performance as John Stewart in his backyard. However, Warner Bros. had plans for the hero, which led to Stewart making way for Martian Manhunter. Now, John Stewart will be one of the stars of the new DCU's Lanterns series, and some actors would excel as the Green Lantern.

Daveed Diggs' turn in Snowpiercer makes him an interesting choice for John Stewart. As Andre Layton, Diggs showed that he can accurately portray one of the Green Lantern's best traits, being believable as a leader that others love to follow into combat. Diggs is also no stranger to DC, as the actor has already played another major hero. Diggs was the voice of Cyborg in DC League of Super-Pets, which means he would likely be open to playing John Stewart in the DCU.

The 50-year-old Mahershala Ali is likely too old to play John Stewart; however, given how Nathan Fillion is playing the Green Lantern Guy Gardner in James Gunn's Superman at 52, it is not impossible. Ali is one of the most talented actors that the DCU could cast as John Stewart, with the actor having a long list of dramatic roles that show his impressive acting skills. Adding to that, he would be perfect for Lanterns, which Gunn described as being inspired by True Detective, a show that Ali led during its third season.

Mahershala Ali is currently attached to another superhero role, set to lead a Blade movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Seeing John Stewart, knowing that there was a black Green Lantern was something like in terms of representation, was like 'Oh Man! There's a space for me in this world and I see it.' And when I looked [at the cartoon], I would think, 'I kind of look like this dude.' If it could happen, that would be legitimately exciting. That would be one of those giddy-inducing moments in life because my kids would get it, without me having to explain it to them.

Right after winning Brazil's 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva caught the international spotlight at Glasgow's COP27 by promising to achieve zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. The newly elected president chose acclaimed environmentalist Marina Silva to head the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, a move seen as a strong indication of his determination to reverse the destructive policies left by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. The results came quickly: 2023, Lula's first year as president, ended up with a 62% decrease in Amazon deforestation.

To keep up with his ambitious targets, Lula needs the engagement of thousands of public servants. But, since early January, officials from three different environmental agencies (IBAMA, the federal environmental agency; ICMBio, which manages national protected areas; and the Brazilian Forest Service, which watches forests' concessions), went on strike, claiming better salaries and work conditions.

""To achieve zero deforestation by 2030 you need people to work, and the people who will deliver this result will be the civil servants who are currently paralyzed,"" Wallace Lopes, an IBAMA federal agent and director at the association that represents the environmental specialists, ASCEMA, told Mongabay in a video call.

The employees have restricted their activities to internal services, significantly impacting field inspection. According to ASCEMA, the number of infraction notices issued in the Amazon states during the first 45 days of the year dropped by 86.2% in 2024 compared with 2023, from 933 to 129. When considering only deforestation infractions, the decrease was 91.2%. In January, 75 planned operations were suspended by IBAMA, according to the Brazilian news outlet Agência Pública.

The environmental specialists category underwent four gloomy years under Bolsonaro, who openly criticized the agents and encouraged land grabbers and illegal miners, especially in the Amazon. Once Lula took office, they watched other public servants receiving priority in negotiations, while the president used the achievements obtained from their work to promote himself abroad.

""It's a huge contradiction that, while the government is in these forums defending a position of environmental protection and preservation, it doesn't look at the civil servants who have the role of enforcing all these promises,"" Lopes said .

One of the category's central claims is the opening of a new public tender to recompose the workforce. IBAMA, which once had 6,000 employees, now has 2,954 , and 1,000 of them may retire by the end of 2025, according to ASCEMA.

""It needs people, a lot,"" Suely Araújo, who headed IBAMA from 2016-19, during Michel Temer's government, told Mongabay in a video call. Araújo said that advancing technology, which allows the issuance of deforestation fines by combining satellite images with public land registries, does not replace fieldwork. ""Who are you going to fine remotely for illegal mining on Indigenous land? You must go there to remove the mining with armed men used to these dangerous situations.""

When it comes to inspectors fighting environmental crimes on the ground, there are around 700 covering the country's six biomes. ""If you divide this by the Brazilian territory plus the territorial sea, we'll have one inspector for an area the size of Denmark. It's a very insane reality,"" Lopes said . According to ASCEMA, the personal deficit for the whole environmental specialist category, which includes the environment ministry, IBAMA and ICMBio, is 4,256 employees -- which means the workforce should be doubled.

Despite Marina Silva's public support for the workers' claims, the negotiations with Lula's government have been harsh. Three meetings took place in February and early March, but there is no sign of agreement so far. According to Lopes, their demands were ignored by the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services (MGI), which is ahead of the negotiations. ""On certain points, the government's proposal makes the current situation worse. Judging by the counterproposals that have been made, we are a long way from solving this,"" he said .

In an email to Mongabay, MGI stated it ""does not comment on negotiation processes within the sectoral and specific tables.""

The longer the strike, the higher the risk of Lula's achievements in the Amazon going down in flames. So far, deforestation is under control. But it may change in the following months once the rainy season ends -- reopening the slash-and-burn season -- and the land-grabbers and illegal miners realize the environmental agents are not coming back.

""It could be a kind of . When it comes to peak deforestation, this could have a huge influence on the numbers,"" Araújo said , adding that President Lula should step up and indicate that the negotiations with the category should be a priority. ""The government has to negotiate before these figures start to reverse.""

""Speeches without effective action, without the presence of the state in the field, will result in an increase in deforestation. This is unavoidable,"" Lopes added .

Environmental inspectors are far from welcome in many parts of Brazil, especially in some Amazon villages where the whole economy revolves around illegal activities like land-grabbing, deforestation and illegal mining. Riots and threats against these professionals are commonplace, so they are trained to use a gun and wear bulletproof vests.

Even so, cases of violence against environmental agents are not rare. According to IBAMA's president, Rodrigo Agostinho, organized crime has infiltrated the Amazon and is now associated with environmental crimes. ""The inspectors have been received with shots during their operations,"" he said in an interview with the Brazilian magazine Veja.

Last year, there were 10 attacks against IBAMA officials only in Yanomami territory, on the border of Amazonas and Roraima states, where the federal government set up a task force to fight illegal miners. In 2017, three agents died after their airplane fell, also in the Yanomami land -- according to Agência Pública, the sole survivor had 40% of his body burned.

""It's really worrying when you leave home and don't know if you're going to make it back. The family gets worried,"" said Lopes, adding that the danger remains even when they are off-duty. ""Because these people who are against our work end up monitoring our steps, the hotel we stay in, where we eat, where we sleep. All the time, servants are startled.""

The circumstances grew worse in the past decade, when the environmental servants didn't get any raises -- it is no surprise that many employees abandoned the job. According to ASCEMA, one out of six employees approved in the last public tender in 2022 had already left their positions in search of better conditions.

That is why the workers claim a new risk bonus for agents exposed to dangerous situations. ""It doesn't make any sense to give the civil servant exposed to these risks the same treatment as a civil servant who lives in Brasília [the federal capital] working exclusively with bureaucracy,"" Lopes argued .

The risk bonus was instituted by Araújo through an when she was ahead of IBAMA, in 2018, but was suspended by Bolsonaro. It returned under Lula, but now the category wants it to become a permanent benefit, ""so we are not subjected to the mood of the IBAMA president on duty,"" Lopes said .

For Araújo, currently a senior public policy adviser at the civil society coalition Climate Observatory, the payment of the benefit is a legal obligation: ""If you put a gun in people's hands and tell them to do surveillance work, there's no way of saying that it doesn't fall under the rules for hazard pay. There's no discussion.""

The employees also demand the payment of a bonus for agents located in remote areas. ""There are conservation units with only one or two ICMBio employees. Sometimes there aren't any,"" Lopes explained . ""We don't have a policy for retaining these people. The restructuring of the career we are asking for brings proposals to solve these problems that affect civil servants, but which are also institutional problems.""

In late February, Brazilian newspapers headlined that thousands of imported cars were stopped at the borders. The reason was the strike at IBAMA, whose servants had to assess the vehicles' environmental standards.

Currently, around 700 of IBAMA's 2,954 employees are field inspectors. The rest work on other activities, ranging from administrative duties, such as assuring the buying of fuel for an on-the-ground operation, to very specialized tasks, such as analyzing a new pesticide's molecule.

That is why public tenders such as the one made in 2022 by Bolsonaro, which prioritized middle-level professionals, didn't solve IBAMA's problems. ""IBAMA is generally staffed by professionals with some connection to environmental issues, but there are people from different areas: biologists, veterinarians, engineers, lawyers. ... The greatest demand is for people with more sophisticated training,"" Araújo said .

One of the most specialized of these works is environmental licensing, which gives the green or red light to the country's most significant infrastructure projects. Due to the strike, the number of licenses issued by IBAMA dropped 67% in the first 45 days of 2024 compared with 2023, falling from 76 to 25, according to ASCEMA.

""And the demand for licensing is growing all the time,"" Araújo state d, explaining that even after an enterprise is licensed, the environmental body has to keep following it for decades to ensure the safeguards are being followed. ""Post-licensing problems, for example, lead to tragedies such as Mariana and Brumadinho,"" she recalled, referring to two major mining dam collapses in Minas Gerais state (in both cases, the licenses were issued by the state government).

Another invisible but crucial part of the environmental specialist's job is the assessment of environmental infractions in administrative procedures that start to run after a fine is issued. ""There will be a defense, an appeal, and sometimes the fine stays there for years. It's a very small team [judging the procedures] and, if it doesn't work well, you lose all the power of enforcement because the offenders know that the fine will lapse,"" Araújo said .

In late January, Marina Silva defended opening a new public tender for IBAMA. However, the ministry didn't respond to Mongabay's questions about if and when it would be launched.

In fact, two of the largest video game companies in the United States -- Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive -- now make the overwhelming majority of their money from live-service games, subscriptions and in-game purchases, according to their recent earnings reports.

Microtransactions are purchases that users make inside a game using real money. They show up as subscriptions, virtual currencies, and character customization options, among other examples.

Popular live-service titles such as Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Clash Royale were built around this revenue model. Game publishers must provide updates throughout certain game life cycles to retain player attention, which is where the term ""live service"" comes from. Gamers pay for those updates through season passes or subscriptions.

Gamer backlash from the early attempts at in-game purchases caused the video game industry to shift its approach to these subscriptions and bundling purchasable content.

""The industry is really moved to more of a what they call a battle pass system, or some kind of packaging of seasonal content,"" said Mat Piscatella, executive director of video games at Circana. ""Those systems have found much warmer response because I think people are finding that they're getting more value, and more reliable value for their money.""

In-game spending has become a high-stakes issue in addition to a lucrative business. Electronic Arts' live-services operations made the company $5.6 billion in its most recent quarter, according to the company's latest earnings report. Epic Games, which created the popular Fortnite franchise, took Apple to court over an in-game payment system that the developer released inside Fortnite in order to bypass Apple's App Store fees.

Public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to pay a dividend over Rs 15,000 crore for the financial year ending March 2024 on the back of improved profitability, according to sources.

In the first three quarters of the current financial year, all 12 PSBs earned a total profit of Rs 98,000 crore, only Rs 7,000 crore less than the entire FY23.

PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

As a result, the government earned a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, 58 per cent higher than the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous financial year.

Since the profit in the current financial year would be much higher than the previous year, so will be the dividend payout to the government, sources said.

Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added.

Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends.

As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends.

The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards.

The draft lays down directions that need to be followed by banks' boards while considering proposals of dividend payouts, which include consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs as well.

The guidelines illustrate steps for mainstreaming climate change in the financial sector to help financial institutions better reflect and manage climate-related risks take advantage of available opportunities and ensure that institutional goals align with national and international climate policies.

Several financial sector players including the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Ministry of Water and Environment, sector regulators and policy bodies, public and private financial institutions such as Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies - SACCOs commenced the development of the draft guidelines in 2018.

Noah Owomugisha, the Head of Investment at Agricultural Business Initiative (ABI) told URN that climate change exposes assets and investments to losses from extreme weather patterns and climate disasters. ""Incorporating climate change consideration into the operations, investment, and lending activities of financial institutions will enable the achievement of sustainable business and national development outcomes both in the short and long term,"" Owomugisha illustrated.

Notably, during the same period, an annual USD 785 million (3.061 billion) of climate finance was mobilized in Uganda between 2019 to 2020, less than 5 percent of the climate finance needs communicated in the NDC.

It is against that background that Benjamin Komna Djabare, a climate finance and policy analyst, also the Deputy Director of Climate Analytics Africa observed that to meet climate investment needs, the government needs significant climate finance and resource mobilization beyond current levels.

Djabare's observation was contained in a draft guideline presented by Mavis Mainu, the Executive Assistant at Climate Analytics on Friday at the Sheraton Hotel in Kampala.

The guidelines validated by the financial sector players aim to aid the government in mainstreaming climate change in Uganda's financial sector.

Several financial sector representatives from the Bank of Uganda, the Insurance Regulatory Authority of Uganda (IRA), the Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority - URBRA, the Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority - UMRA, and the Capital Markets Authority - CMA participated in the validated exercise.

Citing the NDC, Alfred Okot Okidi, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water and Environment notes that the country's scope for climate change adaptation has been broadened ranging from agriculture, forestry, infrastructure, energy, and health to also include ecosystems water and sanitation, among others.

Uganda's Third National Communication 2022, Updated NDC 2022, Uganda Climate Risk Profile 2020, State of Climate of Uganda 2022, and Economic Assessment of the Impact of Climate Change in Uganda 2015 demonstrate that climate risks are on the rise.

The NDC reveals that temperature and precipitation are projected to increase in Uganda over the coming years as well as an increasing trend in extreme or adverse trends of drought, floods, and landslide occurrences among others.

In 2020, Uganda suffered USD 152.2 million, approximately 591.176 billion Shillings in economic losses due to natural disasters, a 14 percent increase compared to 2019.

This period has seen Independent Power Producers (IPPs) grappling with severe financial crises, raising concerns about the stability and reliability of the country's power supply.

Amidst this turmoil, the absence of a guiding hand from the Ministry of Energy was conspicuously felt, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.

The financial woes of IPPs posed a dire threat to the country's energy landscape. As key contributors to the national grid, our instability jeopardised not just the sector's sustainability but also the economic stability and development prospects of the nation. The situation demanded urgent and innovative solutions to avert a full-blown power crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the country's populace and economy.

It took the ingenuity and leadership of the Managing Director of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), Dupik Mahama in the last hour of June 30, 2023, to save the situation.

Recognising the imminent threat, the Managing Director implemented a strategic intervention to safeguard the nation's energy supply. He managed to ring-fence $43 million monthly to us and ensured that the financial resources were allocated efficiently and transparently, directly addressing the liquidity challenges facing the respective IPPs.

This decisive action underscored the importance of creativity and innovation in leadership, especially in times of crisis. The ring-fencing initiative not only stabilized the IPPs' financial positions but the entire sector.

While the Ministry of Energy's absence was a glaring gap, the empathy and resilience shown by the ECG's Managing Director is a demonstration of effective leadership, competence and has indeed saved the power sector.",myjoyonline.com,news,MyJoyOnline.com,,0.1686274509803922,448982910,1,https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eliplim-Apertorgbor.jpg,

Josh Downs had a very solid campaign as a rookie last season for the Colts. He played in all 17 games for the team and 68 receptions for 771 yards and two touchdowns, and he's poised to improve upon those numbers during his sophomore season.

Downs will likely start the season as Indianapolis' No. 2 receiver across from Michael Pittman Jr., and that should afford him ample opportunity to put up numbers. The experience that he gained last season should help, too. Plus, after being limited to just four games last season, quarterback Anthony Richardson is expected to be healthy for the upcoming campaign, and that could mean good news for the receiving corps, both in terms of statistics and the ability to develop some chemistry.

Alec Pierce, Wide receiver

Pierce is in a similar situation to Downs, except he's entering his third season with the team instead of his second. Over the first two yers of his career, Pierce has established himself as a legitimate target, as he has hauled in 73 receptions for 1,107 yards and four touchdowns.

Like Downs, Pierce also could be in line for a productive season with the return of Richardson. The trio of Pittman Jr., Downs and Pierce looks pretty promising on paper, but it's going to be up to them to go out there and execute. If Richardson is able to become the quarterback that the Colts hope they can be, don't be surprised to see big seasons from both Downs and Pierce.",horseshoeheroes.com,news,Horseshoe Heroes,,0.3098039215686275,448982900,1,"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3914,h_2201,x_0,y_14/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/47/01hskr6vdxtd2r55pekh.jpg",

These initiatives aim to create environments where everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or background, feels valued, respected, and included. However, despite their crucial importance, there's a concerning trend of minimizing or even dropping DEI efforts. Here's why such actions are not only misguided but also detrimental to progress.

1. Upholding Principles of Equality: DEI initiatives are rooted in the fundamental principle of equality. They strive to address systemic biases and barriers that hinder the full participation and advancement of marginalized groups. By promoting diversity, ensuring equity, and fostering inclusion, these initiatives pave the way for a fairer and more just society.

2. Driving Innovation and Creativity: Research has consistently shown that diverse teams are more innovative and creative. By bringing together individuals with different perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences, DEI initiatives fuel creativity and drive innovation. Companies and organizations that embrace diversity and inclusion are better equipped to adapt to changing market dynamics and develop groundbreaking solutions.

3. Enhancing Organizational Performance: DEI initiatives are not just about social responsibility; they also make good business sense. Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion outperform their counterparts in terms of financial performance, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. By fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace culture, organizations can attract top talent, improve employee morale, and drive sustainable growth.

4. Reflecting Changing Demographics: The global population is becoming increasingly diverse, with demographic shifts reshaping societies and economies. Ignoring DEI initiatives means overlooking the changing landscape of customers, employees, and stakeholders. Businesses and institutions that fail to adapt to these demographic changes risk becoming irrelevant and obsolete in the long run.

5. Fostering Social Cohesion: Inclusive societies are more cohesive and resilient. DEI initiatives promote understanding, empathy, and solidarity across different groups, reducing social tensions and conflicts. By embracing diversity and fostering inclusion, communities can build bridges, celebrate differences, and create a sense of belonging for all members.

6. Leading by Example: As leaders in their respective fields, companies and organizations have a responsibility to lead by example. By championing DEI initiatives, they send a powerful message about their commitment to fairness, equality, and social justice. Moreover, they inspire others to follow suit, creating a ripple effect that extends beyond their immediate sphere of influence.

In conclusion, DEI initiatives are not just buzzwords; they are indispensable tools for building a more equitable, inclusive, and prosperous future. By recognizing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion, we can harness the full potential of our collective talents and create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Let's not minimize or drop DEI efforts but instead, let's champion them with unwavering commitment and determination.

Regarding the Mini Dubai project planned by the Hungarian government, he said:

""In Zagreb we had to fight the same battle that is now beginning in Budapest. We won. You can do that in Budapest too.""

The progressive Croatian mayor, who graduated from Cambridge and became the first mayor of Zagreb to take part in the Zagreb Pride Parade, wrote that before he was elected mayor of Zagreb, the previous city administration had a project called Zagreb Manhattan. According to the plans, many skyscrapers and luxury apartments would have been built on the banks of the Sava. However, the politician took action against the project, fought with the previous mayor and won.

""I recently heard that the same investor wants to implement almost the same plan in Budapest, which unfortunately he has already succeeded in Belgrade.""

As it turns out, the mayor is against these projects because such investments are essentially playgrounds for billionaires to build apartments for millionaires.

""We don't want isolated communities in our cities. We want to offer affordable and barrier-free housing for everyone.""

We support Gergely Karácsony and the residents of Budapest in the fight against the investment! Good luck! he said.

The project is very controversial. His opponents cite many arguments against it, such as pollution, altitude, interference with wind tunnels and the sale of assets by the state.

However, according to proponents of the project, Gergely Karácsony is inoculated against any development, even though there is nothing better than recultivating and renewing a dirty and smelly area with the help of private investors.

Presumably the problem is not that private investors (even if they are rich) start developing real estate for private individuals (even if they are also rich), but it would be very important that this really happens with private investments and not with government funds (Taxpayer) support.

In any case, Mayor Gergely Karácsony recently visited Belgrade and presented photos of the investment there, and we have presented the highly mixed experiences there in a detailed article.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,0.0117647058823529,448982862,1,,

The President in a recent letter to Parliament requested them to desist from transmitting the anti-LGBTQ+ bill for his assent, citing court issues. The Speaker retaliated by suspending the approval of new ministers.

During an interview on The Big Issue on Citi TV, Mr Cudjoe expressed fear that the impasse between the executive and the legislature could adversely impact the economy.

""We are economically saddled, if we don't talk about gay issues won't we eat? My only worry is that the impasse could have certain tolls on the economy and the governance process. But indeed, we should learn and be wiser out of this particular care, if we manage to get through to it,"" he pointed out.

He emphasized the need for the government to ensure that the impact of the impasse on citizens is mitigated.

""The economy, the impacts on individual rights and indeed anything that we thought may be impacted by this particular anti-gay bill.

""When we heard that the finance minister wrote a letter to the President saying to stay your hands because this may have implications economically, I worried, because I asked myself what were the considerations.""

PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

Public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to pay a dividend in excess of Rs 15,000 crore for the financial year ending March 2024 on the back of improved profitability, according to sources.

In the first three quarters of the current financial year, all 12 PSBs earned a total profit of Rs 98,000 crore, only Rs 7,000 crore less than the entire FY23. PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

As a result, the government earned a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, 58 per cent higher than the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous financial year. Since the profit in the current financial year would be much higher than the previous year, so will be the dividend payout to the government, sources said.

Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added. Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends.

As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends. The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards.

The draft lays down directions that need to be followed by banks' boards while considering proposals of dividend payouts, which include consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs as well.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that a model of the Gaza combat drone was exhibited at the Doha fair -- the first display of the unmanned aerial vehicle outside Iran.

With a range of 1,243 miles, a 68-foot wingspan, and a satellite link, the Gaza drone can carry 13 precision-guided bombs, the report said, adding that the unmanned aircraft represents ""a stepped-up threat to US interests and allies. ""

It described the Iranian drone as a rival for the US-made General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper.

""But in Doha, there was no doubt that Iran's defense industry is going mainstream,"" according to the report.

At the Iranian display in Doha, glossy brochures introduced a dozen home-made products, including air-defense missiles and space-rocket launchers, and flyers promoted new anti-ship cruise missiles and radar systems.

One leaflet described Iran's assault rifles as the best suited ""for guerrilla warfare in all climate conditions.""

Since the expiration of a 13-year UN arms embargo in October, Iran has increasingly sold its defense products on the international market.

Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Mahdi Farahi said in November that the country sold about $1 billion in weapons from March 2022 to March 2023, three times as much as the previous year.

Representatives from Qatar's state defense contractor Barzan Holdings took a look at Iranian-manufactured assault rifles.

""I am very impressed by their medium-range missile technologies,"" said a senior Qatar Air Force officer at the Iran booth.

The report said that Washington had contacted Qatar, home to the biggest US military base in the region, about Iran's presence at the show.

Iranian military experts and engineers have in recent years made remarkable breakthroughs in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient.

Iranian officials have underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, which are entirely meant for defense and deterrence, and that Iran's defense capabilities will be never open to negotiations.

In doing so, they are debating how much funding will be available for our counties, cities, towns, villages and water districts to prevent water pollution and update our water and wastewater infrastructure - the systems that bring clean water to our homes and take dirty water away. The sources of our clean drinking water are precious and need to be preserved. In addition, our water infrastructure is very old and needs a lot of updates to prevent pollution. In every corner of our state, municipalities need funding to modernize drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

It is unusual that clean water funding is part of the state budget debate. Our state leaders know the importance of clean water and have worked across the aisle to upgrade water infrastructure, protect clean water, and prevent pollution from reaching our lakes, rivers, streams, bays, and harbors.

For the last eight years, New York State has dedicated at least $500 million a year to update our water infrastructure. These investments have been vital for Long Island, funding new drinking water main replacements, sewage treatment plant and septic system upgrades, lead pipe replacement, toxic site remediation, and much more. These investments also help unlock millions in federal funding for local projects, a huge help to our municipalities.

Despite these critical investments, more is required. In fact, the total statewide need is estimated to be more than $80 billion over the next two decades. We must not only continue clean water investments across New York, we should increase them to meet the overwhelming need.

Yet, this year, Gov. Kathy Hochul's executive budget proposal included a 50% cut to funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act. This comes as the state's water infrastructure is deteriorating and failing. We need more state funding for clean water infrastructure projects, not less. According to the governor's office, the latest round of Clean Water Infrastructure Act grants created 24,000 jobs across the state.

This year, state funds can go even further than in years past because right now, for a limited time, there are unprecedented federal funds available for water quality improvement projects. State leaders should be seizing this opportunity.

Fortunately, the State Senate and Assembly restored environmental funding in their own budget proposals, including $500 million for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate budget proposal also included an additional $112 million for other water quality improvement projects. We are grateful to state legislators for their leadership and urge them to work with Hochul to ensure these investments are included in the final state budget.

New Yorkers should remember that clean water is the one thing we cannot live without and not something to take for granted. We Long Islanders know how essential clean water is to our lives; water surrounds and sustains our communities from our beloved coasts to the drinking water aquifer beneath our feet. We need to make sure our state leaders never forget how vital clean water is. We all need clean water, and we all depend on the infrastructure that provides it to us. Now is the time to update it.

In fact, two of the largest video game companies in the United States -- Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive -- now make the overwhelming majority of their money from live-service games, subscriptions and in-game purchases, according to their recent earnings reports.

Microtransactions are purchases that users make inside a game using real money. They show up as subscriptions, virtual currencies, and character customization options, among other examples.

Popular live-service titles such as Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Clash Royale were built around this revenue model. Game publishers must provide updates throughout certain game life cycles to retain player attention, which is where the term ""live service"" comes from. Gamers pay for those updates through season passes or subscriptions.

Gamer backlash from the early attempts at in-game purchases caused the video game industry to shift its approach to these subscriptions and bundling purchasable content.

""The industry is really moved to more of a what they call a battle pass system, or some kind of packaging of seasonal content,"" said Mat Piscatella, executive director of video games at Circana. ""Those systems have found much warmer response because I think people are finding that they're getting more value, and more reliable value for their money.""

In-game spending has become a high-stakes issue in addition to a lucrative business. Electronic Arts' live-services operations made the company $5.6 billion in its most recent quarter, according to the company's latest earnings report.

Andrea Celeste Saulo, secretary general of the WMO, said the organisation was now ""sounding the red alert to the world.""

The report found temperatures near the surface of the earth were 1.45°C higher last year than they were in the late 1800s, when people began to destroy nature at an industrial scale and burn large amounts of coal, oil, and gas.

Last year's spike was so scary that NASA's Gavin Schmidt -- Jim Hansen's heir as keeper of NASA's climate record -- wrote in Nature this week that it raised the most profound possible implications. Please read his words slowly and carefully:

It could imply that a warming planet is already fundamentally altering how the climate system operates, much sooner than scientists had anticipated. It could also mean that statistical inferences based on past events are less reliable than we thought, adding more uncertainty to seasonal predictions of droughts and rainfall patterns.

Much of the world's climate is driven by intricate, long-distance links -- known as teleconnections -- fuelled by sea and atmospheric currents. If their behavior is in flux or markedly diverging from previous observations, we need to know about such changes in real time.

And now, with equal care, read the words of the biggest oil producer on earth, the CEO of Saudi Aramco, who was in Houston last week for the annual hydrocarbon festival known as CERAWeek.

We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions.

That is to say, the powers that be want to abandon what the World Meteorological Organization, in their ""red alert"" report called the ""one glimmer of hope"": that renewable energy installations rose 50% last year.

Understand that the battle is fully joined. The fossil fuel industry -- as Exxon CEO Darren Woods helpfully explained -- is in an all-out fight to derail anything green, because it won't return ""above average profits."" They have plenty of allies: Everyone noted former President Donald Trump threatening a ""bloodbath"" last week, but fewer noted the actual target of his wrath: electric vehicles. The Biden administration, after listening to the rhetoric at the Houston conference, backed EVs in a straightforward and earnest way today, announcing new rules that attempt to spur the rapid growth of a crucial climate-fighting technology. But of course that produced the requisite reaction: as The New York Timesreported:

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbying organization, has started what it says is a ""seven figure"" campaign of advertising, phone calls, and text messages against what it falsely calls ""Biden's E.P.A. car ban"" in the swing states Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as in Ohio, Montana, and the Washington D.C. market.

So, like it or not, the climate crisis is going to be a key part of this election campaign. The November outcome may hinge on whether Americans can imagine making even this small change in the face of the gravest crisis our species has ever wandered into: replacing the gas tank in a car with a battery. That doesn't seem like much to ask?

It won't solve the climate crisis, of course -- nothing will solve it. But accelerating momentum towards green energy is the likeliest card we have to play in a world where people seem unwilling to moderate their demands for mobility, and indeed for consumption of any kind.

One particularly depressing set of statistics about that ever-increasing demand for more emerged last week, as the energy implications of artificial intelligence started to become clearer. Here's what Bloombergreported on Wednesday:

John Ketchum, CEO of utility NextEra Energy Inc., told attendees that U.S. power demand, which has been relatively flat for years, is poised to increase by 81% over the next five years. Toby Rice, chief of the largest U.S. natural gas driller, EQT Corp., cited a prediction that AI will gobble up more power domestically than households by 2030.

As Elizabeth Kolbert explained in The New Yorker a few days ago, this ""obscene"" power demand comes because when you ask AI to, say, help you with your bracket for the NCAA tournament, it has to sort through all human knowledge ever. As even AI apostle Sam Altman explained at Davos this year

""I think we still don't appreciate the energy needs of this technology."" He didn't see how these needs could be met, he went on, ""without a breakthrough."" He added, ""We need fusion or we need, like, radically cheaper solar plus storage, or something, at massive scale -- like, a scale that no one is really planning for.""

The truth is, there's no way we can build out renewable energy fast enough to meet this kind of extra demand -- it's going to be at the bleeding edge of the technically and politically possible to power the things we already do, live drive cars and heat homes. And so, in a rational world, faced with an emergency, we would put off scaling AI for now. The irony, of course, is that's it's often been touted as a tool to help solve climate change. But we have the tools we need -- plain old intelligence gave us cheap solar panels.

With the able technological assistance of my wife, I asked Anthropic's AI bot Claude to comment. It was amazing how much he sounded like a PR man; after spinning a lot of jargon-filled guff about how ""responsible AI can likely be part of the solution to environmental challenges,"" he allowed as how he had no idea how much energy he was using. ""In general, the electricity usage of large language models like myself is a relevant consideration from an environmental perspective, but quantifying the exact amount would require additional information I don't have access to.""

Whatever. What we need is not more intelligence. We need more wisdom, to guide us through this pinch point in the human experiment. Including the wisdom to say no to some things, at least until the emergency subsides.",znetwork.org,news,ZNetwork,,-0.0117647058823529,448982428,1,https://znetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/free-photo-of-an-artist-s-illustration-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-this-image-depicts-how-ai-could-be-used-in-the-field-of-sustainability-from-biodiversity-to-climate-it-was-created-by-nidia-dias-scaled.jpeg,

Instead, they were required to attend a mandatory remote operational meeting, only to be blindsided by devastating news -- their jobs were being terminated en masse.

One such employee, a mechanical engineer who requested anonymity, expressed his disbelief at the sudden events. ""The news felt like a punch in the gut,"" he lamented. Others echoed his sentiments, finding themselves abruptly unemployed after years of dedicated service to the company.

Stellantis, however, maintains that these actions were necessary to ""better align resources while preserving the critical skills needed to protect our competitive advantage."" In a statement to FOX 2 Detroit, the company emphasized its commitment to implementing its EV product offensive and Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.

Yet, employees and industry experts alike speculate that the real motive behind the mass firings may be tied to outsourcing practices. According to some workers, Stellantis has been increasingly outsourcing jobs to countries like India, Mexico, and Brazil under the guise of cost efficiency and profitability.

As hundreds of employees grapple with unemployment uncertainty, questions arise about the broader implications for the auto industry. An automotive reporter at Fox 2 highlights carmakers' challenges, including the costly transition to electrification and new UAW contracts.

While Stellantis insists that the reductions are necessary for long-term viability, critics argue that the company's actions do not indicate broader economic trends. Other carmakers have also made cuts in recent months, making it clear that the industry is undergoing significant transformation.

The news is a bitter pill for affected employees, especially considering the government bailout the company received during the bankruptcy era. As Stellantis moves forward with its restructuring efforts, the ripple effects of these mass firings serve as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the automotive industry and the challenges ahead.",webpronews.com,news,WebProNews,,0.04313725490196085,448982412,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-24-at-9.04.54-AM.jpg?fit=1094%2C668&ssl=1,eng-9418400

CHRISTINA MACINTOSH

If you're looking to buy a house sometime after mid-July, you might want to study up on some negotiation tactics.

If a proposal to settle various lawsuits against the National Association of Realtors (NAR) is approved by the courts, negotiation between buyers and buyer's agents for the price of services will become a part of the home-buying process.

Realtors would like to underscore that the change is still just a proposal, subject to court approval. But Realtors across Montana are looking towards the future and what the settlement could mean for the industry.

""I'm 24 years in the business and this is clearly the single largest change to the way real estate works that I've ever seen,"" said Brint Wahlberg, a Realtor in Missoula.

The class-action lawsuits -- an original suit filed in 2019 led to ""copycat"" suits across the nation -- allege that NAR and its affiliates withhold information about buyer broker compensation from buyers, which limits the ability of buyers to negotiate a more favorable price for services and leads to less competition between Realtors.

The new rules seek to introduce more competition into the market, to do what competition in a market is supposed to do: lower costs and improve quality.

While these new rules could ultimately lower the cost of broker's services for home buyers, the change could also lead to difficulties in paying for these services, because mortgage financing does not allow for compensation for an agent, according to Realtors.

""Where there's going to be a need for anything changed, it's going to be at the national level,"" said Cindi Siggs, CEO of the Gallatin Association of Realtors, of changes to mortgage rules.

The settlement, if approved, would apply to the 1.5 million Realtors who are members of NAR -- including 5,617 Realtors in Montana -- and the buyers they serve. The settlement will also require buyer brokers to have written agreements with their buyers, though Montana is one of 13 states that already require this.

Jaymie Bowditch, a lawyer for the Montana Association of Realtors, said the changes will be discussed ""extensively"" at an upcoming MAR meeting in April.

""MAR will probably start trying to provide some information on some mechanisms by which we can now seek to structure compensation for buyer agents,"" Bowditch said in a video posted to MAR's Facebook.

Currently, the vast majority of buyer brokers are paid through a commission on the sale of the home -- ostensibly by the seller, who sets a commission for the broker. This offer is listed on the multiple listing service (MLS), the platform through which Realtors list and view properties.

But the Department of Justice sees who is footing the bill a little differently.

""Buyer broker fees, though nominally paid by the home's seller, are ultimately paid out of the funds from the purchase price of the house,"" reads a press release.

NAR maintains that the fee paid to a buyer's agent has always been negotiable. But almost all MLS systems do not show buyers the commission offered to buyer brokers for different homes, according to the DOJ. Buyer brokers were even able to advertise their services as free before the practice was prohibited by NAR in 2021 in response to lawsuits.

""These rules also make home buyers both less likely and less able to negotiate a discount or rebate off the offered commission,"" reads a Q&A on the case by the DOJ.

Amber Parish, president of the Billings Association of Realtors, and Mike Lake, CEO of Big Sky MLS, said that within their organizations, buyers can always ask their buyer broker about the commission price.

But if the proposed settlement is approved, buyers will be taking a more active role in determining the price of buyer broker services. This new era will not only require negotiation on the part of buyers, as well as advocacy on the part of buyer brokers.

""If a buyer's agent can't explain their value, they're going to have a hard time with these changes and maybe this industry isn't for them,"" Wahlberg said. ""If it washes out people that have a hard time adapting, I don't think that's a bad thing.""

The number of Realtors increased between February 2019 and February 2024, by 13.5% nationally and 26% in Montana.

""Like any industry, you see an ebb and flow when times get tough versus when times are easy,"" Wahlberg said, noting that the Missoula Organization of Realtors shrunk from about 700 Realtors in 2007 to 500 by 2011.

Realtors warn that buyers who choose to forego a Realtor could end up spending more money later, addressing problems that could have been alerted by a Realtor and negotiated with the seller.

""People need protection and guidance in a transaction,"" Siggs said.

As for guidance for Realtors, the extent of NAR guidelines for state and local groups remains to be seen.

""As MAR, we have already had a couple of calls, including a Zoom, and we will be working through this, hopefully with some direction and assistance from NAR,"" Bowditch said.

That said, he said that payment models with ""absolutely not"" be determined by NAR.

""NAR has not always been the best at being forthcoming about changes,"" Parish said. ""With legal issues, you kind of have to keep your mouth shut on those.""

Parish hopes to have more information on new requirements with sufficient time to train agents and appropriately update the MLS system before any changes go into effect.

The leading cryptocurrency closed the session at $65,587.76 partially recovering from a 2.57% loss incurred.

The decline in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provided a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin's price trajectory, contributing to the cryptocurrency's modest gains. Throughout the week, GBTC witnessed a notable decrease in net outflows, reaching its lowest point on Friday at $169.9 million compared to $358.8 million on March 21. This downward trend signaled a positive sentiment among investors as the trading week drew to a close.

However, despite Bitcoin's overall gain, the BTC-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market experienced significant net outflows totaling $887.7 million for the week ending March 22. Both the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw declines in net inflows compared to the previous week. IBIT's net inflows plummeted to $828.3 million, while FBTC observed a decrease to $79.4 million.

The divergence in investor sentiment was evident, with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Although the index increased marginally from 73 to 74 on Sunday, it remained within the Greed Zone. However, further losses in Bitcoin could prompt a transition towards the Neutral zone, potentially impacting investor confidence.

while the decline in outflows from GBTC offered a positive outlook for Bitcoin, the broader trends in the BTC-spot ETF market and investor sentiment underscored the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors remained vigilant, closely monitoring market dynamics and key indicators to gauge the direction of Bitcoin's price movements in the near term.

Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains steadfast in his optimism despite the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. His recent actions and statements reflect a deep conviction in Bitcoin's potential as a superior asset class. Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin's advantages over traditional assets like gold, asserting that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold as the preferred store of value.

Saylor's perspective on Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy amidst a landscape where celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrencies have become less frequent. Unlike the previous bull market, where numerous high-profile figures endorsed various cryptocurrencies, Saylor's consistent support for Bitcoin stands out.

MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, made headlines recently with its substantial purchase of an additional 12,000 BTC, amounting to approximately $821.7 million.

This acquisition was funded through convertible notes and excess cash and was executed at an average price of $68,477 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 205,000 BTC, representing an overall investment of about $6.91 billion. This accumulation of Bitcoin underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition.

Moreover, Saylor's influence extends beyond the realm of traditional finance and into popular culture. With rapper Drake's recent Instagram post about Bitcoin, the digital asset space is likely to garner increased public attention. This intersection of finance and entertainment underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1058823529411765,448982342,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9417954

Some of us are serial nappers who love nothing more than a mid-afternoon snooze, while others struggle to get more than four hours of kip a night.

Scientists in the US have now identified four distinct sleep types and the impact each can have on long-term health. These are:

Almost half of us fall into the insomnia and napper categories, but this is less than ideal, the researchers said.

These are ""suboptimal"" patterns which increase our risk of several killer conditions.

After 10 years, being an insomnia sleeper was associated with a 72 to 188 per cent higher risk of chronic health problems, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and frailty.

It did not, however, increased someone's risk of respiratory conditions.

Meanwhile, nappers appeared to be more likely to develop diabetes, cancer and frailty.

Being a weekend catch-up sleeper or good sleeper was not associated with chronic conditions.

Study author Soomi Lee, associate professor of human development and family studies at The Pennsylvania State University, said: ""Our findings indicate a heightened risk of chronic conditions involved in suboptimal sleep health phenotypes, mainly insomnia sleepers.""

They also recorded the number and type of health conditions each person had.

Good sleepers were characterised by ""optimal"" sleep habits across all data points.

This meant they were getting the recommended seven to nine hours of shut-eye a night, felt well-rested and could focus during the day.

Weekend catch-up sleepers on the other hand tended to get irregular sleep for short periods but longer sleep times on weekends or non-work days.

Sleep is considered irregular if there is one or more hours difference between working days and non-working days, and short if under seven hours a night.

Insomnia sleepers took a long time to fall asleep, only nodded off for short periods, and were extremely tired during the day.

And those who fell into the napper category slept well most of the time but took frequent daytime naps.

Results showed that people were unlikely to change their sleep 'personality' over 10 years.

This was especially true for insomnia sleepers and nappers.

Dr Lee said: ""These results may suggest that it is very difficult to change our sleep habits because sleep health is embedded into our overall lifestyle.

""It may also suggest that people still don't know about the importance of their sleep and about sleep health behaviours.""

The findings, published in Psychosomatic Medicine, suggested that sleep patterns weren't age related, but older adults and retirees were more likely to be nappers.

And those with a lower level of education and people facing unemployment had a higher chance of being insomnia sleepers.

The celebrity gardener and horticulturist has urged people to get on top of things as spring has finally sprung.

David issued his tip as the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, meaning it's a great time to start getting your garden summertime ready. While things look to be improving, David has warned it is at risk because people keep making one mistake with their grass, reports the Mirror.

Speaking from the Ideal Home Show, David gave some top words of wisdom tip for the first cut of the lawn. He urged green-fingered homeowners to leave some of your garden wild for the best results.

He said: ""Dandelions are a great food source for pollinators, so try to leave some areas a little wild to not cut out the positives and let them flourish."" David said that while many people class dandelions as weeds, the little yellow plants actually fertilise your grass.

Instead of acting as a lawn killer, they work hard doing the opposite, feeding birds, bees and butterflies. Their wide-spreading roots also help to loosen hard soil as well as aerate the earth.

David also urged against being too eager with your shears. He said: ""The secret is to give it a high cut and not too short.""

Winter has been a rainy one for many, but David did believe things will be lusher this summer. He said: ""Spring is when the garden comes back to life, it hasn't been a cold winter but it has definitely been a wet winter so I think it will be a green summer, we are seeing a fluctuation nature and it's great.""

Some of us are serial nappers who love nothing more than a mid-afternoon snooze, while others struggle to get more than four hours of kip a night.

Scientists in the US have now identified four distinct sleep types and the impact each can have on long-term health. These are:

Almost half of us fall into the insomnia and napper categories, but this is less than ideal, the researchers said.

These are ""suboptimal"" patterns which increase our risk of several killer conditions.

After 10 years, being an insomnia sleeper was associated with a 72 to 188 per cent higher risk of chronic health problems, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and frailty.

It did not, however, increased someone's risk of respiratory conditions.

Meanwhile, nappers appeared to be more likely to develop diabetes, cancer and frailty.

Being a weekend catch-up sleeper or good sleeper was not associated with chronic conditions.

Study author Soomi Lee, associate professor of human development and family studies at The Pennsylvania State University, said: ""Our findings indicate a heightened risk of chronic conditions involved in suboptimal sleep health phenotypes, mainly insomnia sleepers.""

They also recorded the number and type of health conditions each person had.

Good sleepers were characterised by ""optimal"" sleep habits across all data points.

This meant they were getting the recommended seven to nine hours of shut-eye a night, felt well-rested and could focus during the day.

Weekend catch-up sleepers on the other hand tended to get irregular sleep for short periods but longer sleep times on weekends or non-work days.

Sleep is considered irregular if there is one or more hours difference between working days and non-working days, and short if under seven hours a night.

Insomnia sleepers took a long time to fall asleep, only nodded off for short periods, and were extremely tired during the day.

And those who fell into the napper category slept well most of the time but took frequent daytime naps.

Results showed that people were unlikely to change their sleep 'personality' over 10 years.

This was especially true for insomnia sleepers and nappers.

Dr Lee said: ""These results may suggest that it is very difficult to change our sleep habits because sleep health is embedded into our overall lifestyle.

""It may also suggest that people still don't know about the importance of their sleep and about sleep health behaviours.""

The findings, published in Psychosomatic Medicine, suggested that sleep patterns weren't age related, but older adults and retirees were more likely to be nappers.

And those with a lower level of education and people facing unemployment had a higher chance of being insomnia sleepers.

""Sleep is an everyday behaviour,"" Dr Lee said.

""But it is also modifiable. So, if we can improve sleep almost every day, what outcomes might we see after several months, or even several years?

""Better sleeping habits can make many significant differences, from improving social relationships and work performance to promoting long-term healthy behaviours and healthy ageing.

As we delve into the current trends, it's evident that Bitcoin maintains a bullish stance, bolstered by the triumphant launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the prevailing global macroeconomic sentiment.

Bitcoin has once again captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. The cryptocurrency, known for its volatility, has shown a bullish trend that persisted over the weekend of March 23, 2024.

The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has been a game-changer, providing a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the digital asset. This development has not only legitimized Bitcoin's presence in the traditional financial landscape but also attracted a new wave of investors seeking diversified investment portfolios.

The market has responded positively to Bitcoin's performance, with trading volumes indicating a strong investor confidence. This surge can be attributed to several factors that have aligned to create a favorable environment for Bitcoin's growth.

Key Factors Influencing the Bullish Trend

Several key developments have contributed to this optimistic outlook:

An increasing number of businesses and financial entities have started accepting Bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment and investment, signaling mainstream acceptance.

Current economic conditions have led investors to seek alternative stores of value, with Bitcoin emerging as a viable option due to its decentralized nature.

While the bullish trend is a positive sign for Bitcoin enthusiasts, it is crucial for investors to remain cautious and informed. The cryptocurrency market is still susceptible to sudden shifts due to its inherent volatility.

Bitcoin's performance over the past weekend reaffirms its potential as a significant player in the financial world. However, it is essential for stakeholders to stay abreast of market trends and exercise due diligence in their investment decisions.

Moreover, the global macroeconomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping Bitcoin's trajectory. Amidst inflationary pressures and currency devaluation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Its finite supply contrasts starkly with the expansive monetary policies adopted by central banks worldwide, further cementing its appeal as 'digital gold.'

The synergy between the success of Bitcoin ETFs and the broader economic context underscores a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. As the cryptocurrency continues to mature and integrate within financial systems, its potential for sustained growth appears promising.

In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, Layer-1 blockchains are at the forefront of innovation, providing the foundational infrastructure necessary for decentralized applications.

Among these pioneering platforms is Fantom, a highly scalable and secure network that has been gaining significant traction in recent weeks. The native token of Fantom, known as FTM, has seen a remarkable surge in value, almost tripling within a span of just four weeks.

This impressive growth can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, Fantom's performance-centric technology offers near-instant transaction finality and incredibly low fees, making it an attractive alternative to congested networks like Ethereum.

Lachesis is an innovative consensus mechanism that sets Fantom apart from other blockchain platforms. It is designed to achieve asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT), which ensures high security and maintains consensus even if some nodes fail or act maliciously.

This algorithm allows for transactions to be confirmed in seconds, providing near-instant finality. The speed and efficiency of Lachesis are crucial for decentralized applications that demand quick and dependable transaction processing.

The introduction of Lachesis has been a game-changer for Fantom, enabling it to handle a higher volume of transactions at a faster rate without compromising on security. This has made the platform particularly attractive for developers looking to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps) and for users seeking efficient and reliable transactions.

This impressive growth can be attributed to several key factors that have contributed to increasing investor confidence and demand for FTM.

Firstly, Fantom's underlying technology offers significant advantages over other blockchain platforms, particularly in terms of scalability and transaction speed. The platform's use of a unique consensus algorithm, known as Lachesis, allows for near-instant transaction finality and a high throughput, which is essential for decentralized applications that require fast and reliable transactions.

Secondly, the Fantom Foundation has been actively engaging with the developer community and fostering partnerships that expand the ecosystem's reach and functionality. These collaborations have led to the creation of new decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces on the Fantom network, driving increased usage and locking in value within the platform.

Moreover, the broader market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies has been increasingly positive, with institutional investors and major corporations showing a growing interest in blockchain technology and digital assets. This shift in perception has resulted in a significant influx of capital into the crypto space, benefiting projects like Fantom that demonstrate strong fundamentals and real-world utility.

Lastly, strategic marketing efforts and community-building initiatives have played a crucial role in raising awareness about Fantom's potential. By effectively communicating the platform's advantages and future roadmap, the Fantom Foundation has managed to attract a loyal following of supporters who are invested in the token's long-term success.

In conclusion, Fantom's FTM token has almost tripled in value over four weeks due to its advanced technology, strategic partnerships, positive market sentiment, and effective community engagement. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, Fantom stands out as a promising project with the potential to shape the future of decentralized applications and digital finance.

As more users recognize the benefits of Fantom's high-throughput and developer-friendly environment, the upward trajectory of FTM's market value is a testament to the blockchain's growing prominence in the crypto space.

As we continue to witness the expansion of blockchain technology into various sectors, Layer-1 solutions like Fantom are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized systems. The recent surge in FTM's value is not only a milestone for Fantom but also an indicator of the burgeoning potential within the Layer-1 blockchain landscape.",tekedia.com,news,Tekedia,Paul Godwin,0.4588235294117646,448981738,1,https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11131656/coin-BTC.jpg,eng-9415599

The varsity which has a sanctioned strength of 15 staff of which not one has been filled up since inception in 2011, has now received approval from the Governor who is also the Chancellor. But the actual recruitment will commence only after the election Model Code of Conduct is over. In the absence of full-fledged or permanent staff, the varsity was dependent on guest faculties and lecturers which impeded its growth all these years.

'Besides, the varsity is now entitled to open branches within the State and it intends to open two in Bengaluru, one each in Mangaluru, Kalaburagi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Belagavi.

In addition, the State government, through a trust, was running Dr. Gangubai Hangal Gurukul at Unkal in Hubballi. The varsity will now be entrusted to run the Gurukul for which the former has signed an MoU and formulated the syllabus as well, said Nagesh Bettakote, Vice Chancellor of the varsity.

MoUs signed

While this will increase its student strength befitting the status of a full-fledged university, it is also expected to bring in a semblance of stability besides commanding greater heft in the academic and performing arts circle. Prof. Bettakote said that so far they have entered into affiliations with 39 of which 6 MoUs were signed last week with various academies and institutions in the realm of fine arts.

This includes Hamsalekha Desi Vidya Samsthe, Bengaluru, which offers courses in different genres of music including classical and folk, Sri Dikshit Academy, Bengaluru, Natanam Bala Natya Kendra, Shivamogga, Natyataranga Trust, Sagar, Tagore Cultural Academy, Bengaluru and Kailasa Kaladhara Trust, Bengaluru.

Examinations

""They will offer courses as per the syllabus of the university and students will have to get through a proctored examination to be conducted by us on completion of the course. If successful, they will be eligible for the award of degree or post graduate degree, certificate, etc., depending on the duration of the course completed,"" said Prof. Bettakote.

While there are no financial implications for the university by way of additional expenditure, the arrangement will be a source of income by way of receipt of a nominal percentage of fee that is levied on the students by the affiliated institutions.

As per the UGC norms, classes are being conducted under the blended mode with 60% online classes and 40% physical classes. In addition, the music varsity is now vested with the responsibility of conducting examinations for senior and junior courses that used to be conducted by the SSLC Board. As a result, more than 17,600 students will face the examination to be conducted by the varsity, said Prof. Bettakote. In the Mysuru campus, there are nearly 200 students pursuing various courses.

Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh has faced territorial disputes and suffered the effects of climate change.

Shifting weather patterns in the sparsely populated villages altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts.

Prominent climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is taking part in the demonstrations in the town of Leh.

He has been on a fast since the protests started on March 6, surviving only on salt and water in the open in sub-zero temperatures.

Temperatures have been as low as minus six degrees and snowing in recent days.

Mr Wangchuk, also an engineer working on solutions for sustainability at his Himalayan Institute of Alternative Ladakh, has called his protest a ""climate fast.""

""We're already facing climate disaster and these glaciers and mountains will be destroyed if there is not a check on unbridled industrial development and military maneuvers [in the region],"" Mr Wangchuk told The Associated Press.

He has been joined by about 200 other people sleeping under the open sky as part of the demonstration.

Ladakh's thousands of glaciers -- which helped dub the rugged region one of the ""water towers of the world"" -- are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people.

The melting has been exacerbated by an increase in local pollution that has worsened due to the region's militarization, further intensified by the deadly military stand-off between India and China since 2020.

He also said Ladakh critically needs ecological protection because ""it's not just a local disaster in [the] making but an international one as these mountains are part of Greater Himalayas intricately linked to over two billion people and multiple countries.""

Mr Wangchuk said the Ladakh nomads were also losing prime pastureland to huge Indian industrial plans and Chinese encroachment.

The region's shepherds complain that Chinese soldiers have captured multiple pasturelands and restricted them from grazing their herds.

The shepherds and Mr Wangchuk are planning to march to the Chinese border later this month to underscore what they say is Beijing's land grab attempts in Ladakh to gain territory.

In August 2019, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its statehood and semi-autonomy.

While restive Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on any form of dissent and slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified with demands of statehood and for local legislature to be able to frame their own laws on land and agriculture.

The region's representatives have held several rounds of talks with Indian officials, including with the powerful Home Minister Amit Shah earlier this month, without any results.

""This government likes to call India the 'Mother of Democracy',"" Mr Wangchuk recently posted on X.

""But if India denies democratic rights to people of Ladakh and continues to keep it under bureaucrats controlled from New Delhi then it could only be called a Stepmother of Democracy as far as Ladakh is concerned.""",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,-0.207843137254902,448981485,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/678d9af8525a9d308b4064d223651737?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=876&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,eng-9419920

The mines' owner, Sibelco, is investing $700 million to expand capacity, but is that enough to keep up with AI-fueled demand?

Spruce Pine is a small town about two hours drive northwest of Charlotte, NC. You can get to the general area via a number of ways, depending on your point of origin, but for the last stretch of the trip, you need to travel down Fish Hatchery Rd. It's a two-lane rural highway, as depicted in Google Maps, set amid a pleasant scenic backdrop.

It's on this road that the modern economy rests, according to Wharton associate professor Ethan Mollick, who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship and also examines the effects of artificial intelligence on work and education. That's because the road runs to the two mines that are the sole supplier of the quartz required to make the crucibles needed to refine silicon wafers.

This is not the first time these mines - owned by Sibelco, which mines, processes, and sells specialty industrial minerals - have been highlighted as integral not only to the global semiconductor industry but also to the solar photovoltaic markets. Ed Conway raised the issue in his book, Material World, published last summer. Even before that, various media have covered the obscure mines. Mollick raised it again in a recent Tweet, emphasizing its strategic importance. If the mines were somehow to stop operating, ""it would likely [be] a few years of major disruption while techniques to generate alternatives were scaled up. But the disruption would be pretty catastrophic.""

It is an alarming prospect to contemplate, and it is fair to wonder whether Mollick is indulging in a bit of hyperbole. But there is no denying the fact that digital devices around the world contain a small piece of Spruce Pine's unique ultra-high-purity quartz. ""It does boggle the mind a bit to consider that inside nearly every cell phone and computer chip you'll find quartz from Spruce Pine,"" Rolf Pippert, mine manager at Quartz Corp, a leading supplier of high-quality quartz, tells the BBC.

How did this unassuming North Carolina town gain such an outsized role in the global semiconductor supply chain? The answer is its unique mineral deposits, which formed 380 million years ago during the collision of Africa and North America. The intense heat and lack of water during their formation created quartz rock of unparalleled purity. These rocks are extracted from the ground and turned into quartz gravel, which is then processed into a fine sand. The silicon is separated from other minerals and then goes through a final milling. The final product is a powder that is shipped to refineries.

The inexorable march of artificial intelligence will continue to drive demand for chips and the materials in its supply chain. One question to ponder is whether Spruce Pine can keep up.

Sibelco, of course, has noted these trends as well and last year announced a $200 million investment to double high purity quartz capacity at its Spruce Pine facility, citing demand for the product, which is sold under the brand name IOTA. It will invest a further $500 million between 2024 and 2027.",techspot.com,news,TechSpot,Erika Morphy,0.1215686274509804,448981451,1,https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2024/03/2024-03-24-image-2.jpg,

Russian Air Force Launches Attack on Ukrainian Targets, Disrupting Infrastructure and Destroying NATO-Supplied Equipment

Late on March 24, the Russian Air and Space Forces (ASF) launched a series of airstrikes on various targets in Ukraine, including locations where naval drones are assembled. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has confirmed these reports.

The airstrikes targeted energy infrastructure facilities, gas extraction enterprises, as well as assembly and testing sites for unmanned boats, which are commonly referred to as naval drones. The attack not only caused significant disruption to Ukraine's military enterprises but also resulted in the destruction of foreign-made equipment that had been supplied by NATO.

Driving on Interstate 215 south of Salt Lake City in late January, I couldn't help but notice the bumper stickers on the pickup truck in front of me. One featured a rattlesnake and the classic motto ""Don't tread on me,"" which dates to the Revolutionary War but has been co-opted by many right-wing ideologues. And the other featured a map of a shrinking lake and the words ""Keep the Salt Lake Great,"" the motto of a local environmental group focused on protecting Utah's rivers and ecosystems.

Those dual views perfectly capture the ethos of Utah, a deep red state whose natural beauty is being threatened by more intense heat waves and extreme drought. A proud coal- and oil-producing state, it's led by conservative lawmakers, and recent national surveys show it's one of the most Republican states in the country. Back in 2010, the Utah Legislature even passed a resolution that essentially wrote climate change denial into state policy by urging the EPA to ""cease its carbon dioxide reduction policies, programs, and regulations until climate data and global warming science are substantiated.""

But since then, Utah has been impacted by climate change more than most states -- over the last 50 years, temperatures in the state have risen at about twice the global average, and it has faced worsening drought, wildfires, flash floods and extreme heat waves. The impact has been devastating on the health and well-being of residents, with decreasing productivity of farms and higher rates of respiratory disease and asthma, along with other heat-related diseases.

And climate change has seriously damaged one of the state's natural wonders -- that map on the truck driver's bumper sticker reveals how climate change has shrunk the Great Salt Lake's footprint by half in the last decades due to the reduced flow of mountain streams that feed the lake and higher demand for freshwater for new development and agriculture.

The crisis has also increased climate awareness in the state, with half of residents in a recent survey saying that climate change is an extremely or very serious problem and 64 percent saying they've noticed significant effects from climate change over the past 10 years.

""For voters, climate has become a bigger issue than it has been in the past,"" said Josh Kraft, government and corporate relations manager for Utah Clean Energy, a public interest group that launched a historic compact in 2020 that brought together more than 100 of the state's political and business leaders to stimulate support for clean energy and energize conversations on climate action and clean air solutions.

That bipartisan concern with climate change is now impacting politics in the state -- where two self-professed climate candidates are running to replace Mitt Romney in the U.S. Senate. In total, there are five GOP candidates polling higher than 3 percent and three Democratic candidates running in the June 25 primary.

In the Republican primary, the frontrunner, U.S. Rep. John Curtis, is highlighting the need to address the climate crisis, pushing for more support for clean energy. He founded and leads the Conservative Climate Caucus in Congress and blames his party for not taking climate change seriously.

""We want to work together as Republicans and Democrats, because at the end of the day, we all care about leaving the Earth better than we found it,"" Curtis recently told the Sierra Club. ""That's how I talk about it -- who doesn't want to leave the Earth better than we found it?""

But climate activists are doubtful, claiming that Curtis is too reliant on industry-friendly solutions such as carbon capture and opposes some of President Biden's signature climate accomplishments, including the Inflation Reduction Act.

In the Democratic primary, mountaineer and environmental activist Caroline Gleich has made climate action and air quality a key focus of her campaign. She rallied lawmakers in the state to take action to increase water flow to the Great Salt Lake as part of a larger climate agenda that includes cutting subsidies for fossil fuels, taking advantage of Inflation Reduction Act funds aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy in the state, and protecting public lands. ""Our mountains, our air, our rivers and lakes, our lives deserve respect,"" Gleich has repeatedly said.

Yet she sees a disconnect between public support for climate action and the policies pursued by the state's political leadership, noting that the Legislature recently voted to increase the tax on EV charging and to reduce the tax on gasoline. ""And when you look at who's funding these candidates, you see there's a huge amount of oil and gas and fossil fuel companies giving money to them,"" Gleich said.

Indeed, Curtis is a major recipient -- his district includes an area known as Carbon County due to its abundance of coal and natural gas, and he has accepted $265,000 from oil and gas industry-linked political action committees since 2017. Curtis did not return calls from Capital & Main for comment.

Gleich's view is echoed by Zach Frankel of the Utah Rivers Council, an environmental group that distributes the Great Salt Lake bumper stickers. ""We're in a state of climate change denial -- politicians might say that it's real in an election year, but if we start asking them if we should embrace climate adaptive policies, they say no. They assume that any crisis is decades away.""

Frankel is encouraged by the growing public concern over climate issues, such as the shrinking Great Salt Lake -- the largest remaining wetland ecosystem in the American West -- and the growing frustration with the lack of action.

""The state of Utah has refused to embrace any kind of meaningful policy plan to raise lake levels,"" he said, predicting that ""it will have to get worse before it gets better.""

As elsewhere in the country, younger voters in the state seem to be more galvanized than older voters about the issue and demanding action. At a climate strike on the steps of the Utah state house last year, activists condemned the Legislature for not making serious efforts to reduce emissions. A legislator's move to slash emissions at U.S. Magnesium, which harvests lithium and magnesium from the Great Salt Lake, was scaled back to a mere study of the effects of pollutants created in the process.

""Young people are disproportionately affected by eco-anxiety because it's their future,"" said Gleich, who at 38 is the youngest candidate in the Senate race. ""That is what is on the line in this election.""",grist.org,news,Grist,,-0.0117647058823529,448981427,1,https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GreatSaltLake.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,

The preference for spirits over beer and wine has not changed dramatically over the past 10 years but beer drinkers are starting to catch up (based on sales, not volume). With the Hispanic population growing at 2x the general population in the U.S., Mexican beer brewers like Modelo (NYSE:STZ), Dos Equies (OTCQX:HEINY) and Tecate (OTCQX:HEINY) are reaping the benefits from the growth in the Hispanic population. According to Piper, in 2023, Mexican beer was the only alcohol import to increase, gaining 1.9% from the year prior. By comparison, statistics from Piper show alcohol imports from Ireland were down 15%, down 16% from The Netherlands, and down 31% from Belgium.

That's good news for Modelo, brewed in Mexico and imported into the U.S. by Constellations Brands (STZ). With the former number one beer plagued by boycotts and a crippling billion-dollar loss in sales, Modelo (STZ) captured the top spot from Bud Light (BUD), once the most popular beer in the U.S. for over 20 years. In the wake of the Dylan Mulvaney boycott Bud Light (BUD) lost 415 basis points in market share while Modelo (STZ) gained 225 basis points. Other brands also benefited from Bud Light's topple with Miller Lite (TAP) gaining 80 basis points of share, Coors (TAP) gaining 130 bps and Corona (STZ) up 50 bps since last April. Michelob Ultra (BUD) has now taken the number two U.S. beer spot from Bud Light (BUD).

The $38B spirits market has not seen much growth in revenue over the past year and is just edging out beer sales for a second consecutive year, although that lead is narrowing. While sales exceed beer and wine, the majority of consumers, as cited by Piper, prefer beer which continues to lead spirits and wine on a volume basis.

As a percentage of the $90B in revenue for the entire U.S. alcohol market, spirits have a 42.2% share, followed by a 41.7% share for beer, while wine was just 16.1%.

A third category (although technically considered beer or spirits under Alcohol and Tobacco tax rules) including seltzers, malt beverages, spiked teas, and ready-to-drink have been steadily gaining market share among younger drinkers. The popularity of brands like White Claw and The Boston Beer Company's (SAM) Truly ignited a wave of imitators from mainstream brands like Anheuser-Busch (BUD), and Molson Coors (TAP), morphing into ready-to-drink options with harder liquor from Topo Chico (KO), Bacardi, and even coffee-infused cocktails. According to Piper, pre-mixed cocktails have become a $2.5B to $3.0B segment of the $38B spirits category with ""strong double-digit volume and revenue growth"" while sales for legacy hard seltzers have been declining.

Who's drinking all of this? According to a Gallup poll, 62% of adults drink alcohol while 38% are teetotalers, a relatively stable trend since the mid-90s. Middle-aged adults, higher income consumers, and college-educated adults all have higher drinking rates than other demographics. Sixty-nine percent of 35-54-year-olds are more likely to be drinkers, up from 63% 20 years ago, while just 61% of 18-34-year-olds are drinkers down from 67% in 2001-2003. And for those over 55, the number of individuals who drink regularly has increased from 49% to 59% in the same 20-year period. It's uncertain how cannabis influences this data, but considering most states legalized cannabis over the last few years, it's unlikely to have much of an impact on the number of 18-34 year olds who drink.

Beer drinkers remain in the majority with 37% drinking beer, 31% liquor, and 29% wine. Although the consumption of wine remained steady until this year, liquor consumption has picked up from a 2018 low of 19%, corresponding to 42% of beer drinkers.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Amy Thielen,0.3176470588235294,448981385,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1435022477/image_1435022477.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,

Yorktown clean-up heads to phase two,"A green light illuminates a fuel tank that's been filled with water inside the aircraft carrier Yorktown, which is undergoing cleanup and remediation efforts at Patriots Point, on March 19. Without a cleanup, a spill could result in disaster.

Beneath the commanding exterior hull of the 30,000-ton aircraft carrier sitting in Charleston Harbor is a hazard that if left unchecked could one day threaten the region's vulnerable coastal ecosystem.

One would have to travel down steep ladders, crouch down through holes cut in riveted metal walls and dodge pipes overhead to access hundreds of compartments closed off from the public eye of visitors to the museum attraction above. The underbelly of these sections of the Yorktown has dangers lurking everywhere, from rusted walls, flaked lead paint chips scattered on the floor, layers of dust collecting and access points to tanks filled with oil and contaminated water.

Business Launching new partnerships: Charleston Race Week to call Patriots Point home from now on By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com

Last week, a member of the remediation team removed the tank cover, exposing a thick opaque oil within easy reach that slowly dripped from the dipstick that stirred it. Looking down a cleaned tank, one can see through multiple compartments of the ship straight down into the darkness below. Some are as deep as 32 feet, 23 feet long and 8 feet wide. This is just a snippet of the condition that remediation teams are working to clean up.

State officials have spent the past several years and millions of dollars in a race against time to prevent further corrosion that would let the pitch-black poison seep out. On March 19, they celebrated hitting the halfway point -- and looked ahead to the substantial amount of work that still remains.

Nearly two years after signing an executive order in 2022 directing the S.C. Office of Resilience to study how to remove the contaminants to prevent them from leaking into Charleston Harbor, Gov. Henry McMaster returned to reiterate the importance of the work being done aboard the Yorktown.

Business SC's Yorktown remediation plan advancing with a hefty price tag By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com

The first phase, which included the study, plan and immediate hull repairs, wrapped up in December. The remediation investigation reviewed more than 900 compartments across the Yorktown, searching for traces of asbestos, lead paint, fuel and contaminated water. The first phase included the extraction of 568,800 gallons of oily water, the removal of 8.88 tons of sludge and mud, the disposal of 4.5 tons of asbestos waste and external hull repairs. Divers patched 35 points where water was leaking into empty compartments within the hull.

The General Assembly's Joint Bond Review Committee has already committed $10 million to the first phase of the project. Another $18 million in federal funds were appropriated on March 20. The next stage, which includes the removal and remediation of the contaminants, will kick off this year. It will cover the removal of 1.2 million gallons of hydrocarbons, 15,000 gallons of fluid from nonstructural compartments, bulk liquid from machinery room bilge compartments and tank cleaning.

The total budget for both phases is $30 million. The money comes from South Carolina's cut of the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Jacqueline Michel, a consultant with Columbia-based firm RPI, said the approach is to remediate by offloading contaminants for proper disposal, mitigate hazards in these areas and isolate areas that cannot be repaired.

Military Digest Attention to detail: Veteran collects 93 hoses for Patriots Point By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com

During a March 19 news conference, Robert Boyles, director of the state's Department of Natural Resources, held up a mason jar filled with a sample of oil taken from a tank.

""It's nice and pretty when it's contained as it is now... It's a lot easier to deal with,"" he said.

A spill from the Yorktown could have devastating impacts on local water bodies, according to the South Carolina Office of Resilience, which is tasked with overseeing the ship's cleanup. SCOR predicts that a release of 50 barrels, or just 2,100 gallons, of fuel from the Yorktown could impact the Cooper and Wando Rivers, Charleston Harbor and Folly Beach.

If the Yorktown were to leak fuel oil, one of the greatest threats would be its smothering effect on local wildlife, according to a 2023 Yorktown remediation report. Thicker than water, the heavy fuel would coat local seabirds, ducks and diving birds -- likely causing significant deaths among those populations.

Charleston's heavily trafficked waters have been contaminated by such spills before.

In September 2002, the containership M/V Everreach dumped about 12,500 gallons of fuel oil into the Cooper River in North Charleston. The spill caused damage to local wildlife habitats and spurred a temporary closure of a shellfish bed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 30 miles of shoreline were impacted by the spill.

Just a few years earlier, in January 1999, the M/S Star Evviva accidentally dumped about 24,000 gallons of fuel oil roughly 30 to 50 miles off the coast of the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge. Two days later, oiled birds began washing up on shores from Folly Beach to Topsail Beach in North Carolina, according to a state DNR report.

Business SC's Medal of Honor Museum plans at Patriots Point pivot as renovation gets underway By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com

""That spill impacted thousands of coastal birds and affected a lot of outdoor recreation for a lot of people, and affected our commercial seafood industry as well,"" Boyles said.

The Yorktown was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in America's operations in the Pacific through the final months of World War II. It remained in regular rotation over the coming decades, undergoing updates and remodels, until the Navy donated it to South Carolina in ""as is"" condition in 1975.

Boyle said that Patriots Point, specifically the centerpiece museum ship, stands as a symbol of patriotism and should stay that way.

""The Fighting Lady reminds us of concepts that are critical today: duty, honor, country, courage,"" he added. ""What we do not want to remember the Yorktown for is dirty, harmful cleanup.""

While it's firmly lodged in pluff mud at Patriots Point, the Yorktown is still somewhat vulnerable to powerful storms. A nor'easter in December 2023 was strong enough to shift the massive vessel about 6 inches. The vessel also shifted during 1989's Hurricane Hugo, considered the worst hurricane in recent history to strike the Lowcountry.

The Yorktown will likely be battered by other strong storms in the near future. Global ocean surface temperatures hit record highs last year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Those warmer waters threaten to supercharge hurricane intensity and the speed at which tropical storm systems evolve from minor to major threats.

""These ships were built to last an absolute maximum of 30 years, and we just celebrated the 80th birthday of the Yorktown last year,"" Allison Hunt, executive director of Patriots Point, said. ""This is not a project we could have taken on by ourselves, so we are so grateful for the help in preserving this ship for all of our visitors to enjoy and learn from.""

Some of us are serial nappers who love nothing more than a mid-afternoon snooze, while others struggle to get more than four hours of kip a night.

Scientists in the US have now identified four distinct sleep types and the impact each can have on long-term health. These are:

Almost half of us fall into the insomnia and napper categories, but this is less than ideal, the researchers said.

These are ""suboptimal"" patterns which increase our risk of several killer conditions.

After 10 years, being an insomnia sleeper was associated with a 72 to 188 per cent higher risk of chronic health problems, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and frailty.

It did not, however, increased someone's risk of respiratory conditions.

Meanwhile, nappers appeared to be more likely to develop diabetes, cancer and frailty.

Being a weekend catch-up sleeper or good sleeper was not associated with chronic conditions.

Study author Soomi Lee, associate professor of human development and family studies at The Pennsylvania State University, said: ""Our findings indicate a heightened risk of chronic conditions involved in suboptimal sleep health phenotypes, mainly insomnia sleepers.""

They also recorded the number and type of health conditions each person had.

Good sleepers were characterised by ""optimal"" sleep habits across all data points.

This meant they were getting the recommended seven to nine hours of shut-eye a night, felt well-rested and could focus during the day.

Weekend catch-up sleepers on the other hand tended to get irregular sleep for short periods but longer sleep times on weekends or non-work days.

Sleep is considered irregular if there is one or more hours difference between working days and non-working days, and short if under seven hours a night.

Insomnia sleepers took a long time to fall asleep, only nodded off for short periods, and were extremely tired during the day.

And those who fell into the napper category slept well most of the time but took frequent daytime naps.

Results showed that people were unlikely to change their sleep 'personality' over 10 years.

This was especially true for insomnia sleepers and nappers.

Dr Lee said: ""These results may suggest that it is very difficult to change our sleep habits because sleep health is embedded into our overall lifestyle.

""It may also suggest that people still don't know about the importance of their sleep and about sleep health behaviours.""

The findings, published in Psychosomatic Medicine, suggested that sleep patterns weren't age related, but older adults and retirees were more likely to be nappers.

And those with a lower level of education and people facing unemployment had a higher chance of being insomnia sleepers.

""Sleep is an everyday behaviour,"" Dr Lee said.

""But it is also modifiable. So, if we can improve sleep almost every day, what outcomes might we see after several months, or even several years?

""Better sleeping habits can make many significant differences, from improving social relationships and work performance to promoting long-term healthy behaviours and healthy ageing.

""We need to make more efforts to educate the public about good sleep health.

""There are sleep hygiene behaviours that people could do to improve their sleep, such as not using cell phones in bed, exercising regularly and avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon.""",thesun.co.uk,news,The Sun,Alice Fuller,-0.1215686274509804,448981352,1,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/concept-healthy-sleeping-hypoallergenic-memory-802763786-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9420622

The Octopus logo was everywhere and Jackson regaled audiences of dignitaries, politicians and the business elite with stories about how the energy retailer, and its digital retail platform Kraken, was transforming the UK energy market.

The previous day, around half a million Octopus customers had been paid to use less electricity at peak times. The scale of the group's UK operations meant this incentive had the same effect as ""turning off the entire energy consumption of two cities,"" he explained.

Globally we're facing a plastic pollution crisis at a scale we have never seen.

But the impacts of this crisis are not felt equally. From the ""production"" to the ""disposal"" of plastic, *the most vulnerable communities often experience the worst effects of pollution { Africa is concentrated with these vulnerable communities }

As Young People we can ensure a plastic free environment by advocating for sustainable policies from grassroots levels that will provide consistent removal of plastic waste from our hotspot areas.

As young people we can also indulge into developing skills in green industries, starting or joining green business aimed at turning the tide of plastic pollution into a lucrative enterprise. Most important, we must be willing TO PARTICIPATE in the implementation of strategies to combat plastic pollution, not forgetting that WE ARE AT THE CENTER OF VULNERABILITY!

The leading cryptocurrency closed the session at $65,587.76 partially recovering from a 2.57% loss incurred.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows ease, contributing to modest gains

The decline in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provided a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin's price trajectory, contributing to the cryptocurrency's modest gains. Throughout the week, GBTC witnessed a notable decrease in net outflows, reaching its lowest point on Friday at $169.9 million compared to $358.8 million on March 21. This downward trend signaled a positive sentiment among investors as the trading week drew to a close.

However, despite Bitcoin's overall gain, the BTC-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market experienced significant net outflows totaling $887.7 million for the week ending March 22. Both the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw declines in net inflows compared to the previous week. IBIT's net inflows plummeted to $828.3 million, while FBTC observed a decrease to $79.4 million.

Navigating Bitcoin's market sentiment and investor confidence

The divergence in investor sentiment was evident, with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Although the index increased marginally from 73 to 74 on Sunday, it remained within the Greed Zone. However, further losses in Bitcoin could prompt a transition towards the Neutral zone, potentially impacting investor confidence.

while the decline in outflows from GBTC offered a positive outlook for Bitcoin, the broader trends in the BTC-spot ETF market and investor sentiment underscored the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors remained vigilant, closely monitoring market dynamics and key indicators to gauge the direction of Bitcoin's price movements in the near term.

Michael Saylor's perspective and near-term considerations

Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains steadfast in his optimism despite the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. His recent actions and statements reflect a deep conviction in Bitcoin's potential as a superior asset class. Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin's advantages over traditional assets like gold, asserting that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold as the preferred store of value.

Saylor's perspective on Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy amidst a landscape where celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrencies have become less frequent. Unlike the previous bull market, where numerous high-profile figures endorsed various cryptocurrencies, Saylor's consistent support for Bitcoin stands out.

MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, made headlines recently with its substantial purchase of an additional 12,000 BTC, amounting to approximately $821.7 million.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation and influence in popular culture

This acquisition was funded through convertible notes and excess cash and was executed at an average price of $68,477 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 205,000 BTC, representing an overall investment of about $6.91 billion. This accumulation of Bitcoin underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition.

Moreover, Saylor's influence extends beyond the realm of traditional finance and into popular culture. With rapper Drake's recent Instagram post about Bitcoin, the digital asset space is likely to garner increased public attention.

So far, in examining what the World Health ­Organization calls the commercial determinants of health, I have been looking at private sector firms that produce ­products that harm health, such as tobacco, fossil fuels or unhealthy foods.

But the private sector does not just produce goods, it also provides financial services -- such as banking and pensions -- that support various industries by investing in them or providing loans.

Where these services are provided to companies that are producing products that are good for our health, such as healthy food or healthy housing, they ­contribute to health. But when they provide financial support to industries that produce harmful products they are harming health.

This issue comes under the broad heading of ­ethical investment, in which environmental, social and ­governance (ESG) concerns are a factor in making investment decisions. Ethical investors, for example, may choose not to invest in tobacco, fossil fuels or armaments for moral reasons.

In a recent article in Forbes Advisor, finance adviser Kat Tretina comments: ""Investing solely to benefit from the highest possible returns is becoming ­somewhat passé.""

She cites a 2022 Stanford University study that found older investors were ""overwhelmingly opposed"" to the idea of forfeiting investment return in order to advance environmental, social and governance ­objectives. Young investors, on the other hand, claimed to be ­willing to give up moderate (five to 15 per cent) or large (over 15 per cent) amounts to bring about such changes.

But while ethical investment can be a personal ­decision about where to invest, most of us have large parts of our investments through our pensions (CPP and various other pension funds) over which we have little or no direct control. So it is important that banks and pension funds invest ethically on our behalf, and that we urge them to do so.

In the case of tobacco, as a result of persistent ­advocacy by anti-smoking groups around the world, a number of major pension funds have divested from tobacco. A 2020 report from Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada noted several public pension funds have divested from tobacco, including California (2000), Aotearoa, New Zealand (2007), and Norway (2010).

But the report also notes: ""Within Canada, with the notable exception of Alberta, governments have not consistently accepted responsibility for ensuring that the money under their stewardship is not invested in tobacco.""

Indeed, in responding to one of my columns, ­Pender Island resident Paul Hutcheson noted in a Jan. 22 comment in this newspaper that the British Columbia Investment Management Corp., which is an arm of the B.C. government, ""has $124.25 million invested in the tobacco industry.""

When it comes to fossil fuels, the Canadian banking and pension sectors have been the focus of recent ­critical reports.

A report released this month by FinanceMap, part of a global non-profit think tank called Influence Map, found that the ""Big Five"" Canadian banks (Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal, and Canadian Imperial Bank of ­Commerce) ""are undermining their own net zero ­commitments through their financing activities, lack of robust sector financing policies, and inconsistent policy engagement.""

Specifically, the report found, ""the Big Five steadily increased their fossil fuel financing exposure from an average of 15.5 per cent in 2020 to 18.4 per cent in 2022"" compared to ""6.1 per cent for leading U.S. banks and 8.7 per cent for European banks.""

Moreover, none ""have committed to a phase-out of financing thermal coal"" or ""publicly advocated for ambitious climate-related policy in Canada."" This in spite of the fact that they are all signatories to the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

The pension funds don't fare any better. The 2023 Canadian Pension Climate Report Card from Shift Action for Pension Wealth and Planet Health noted that not a single pension fund had acknowledged ""the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels.""

Indeed, it said, ""Canada's largest pension funds ­continue to invest their own members' retirement ­savings in companies that are accelerating the climate crisis, while delaying efforts to confront this unprecedented threat.""

Isn't it time the financial sector stopped investing in products that harm our health -- and remember, there are many other industries out there that harm our health -- and instead invested in our health and ­well-being?

Dem stunt to foist off Gen Z cross-country skier as climate 'expert' goes downhill fast,"In another one of the theatrical stunts that have become their stock and trade, Democrats tried to pass off a Generation Z cross-country skier as an ""expert"" climate change witness and it did not go well.

During a Senate Budget Committee hearing this week to consider the topic of the effects of the alleged weather crisis on sports and recreation, the left-wing global warming ideologues introduced 23-year-old Olympic skier Gus Schumacher to testify only to watch him walk right into the teeth of human buzzsaw Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) who humiliated the young man.

""The impacts of climate change on outdoor recreation, particularly Nordic skiing, are undeniable and demand urgent action,"" said Schumacher in a statement that was likely written for him. ""As stewards of our planet and custodians of our outdoor heritage, we have a moral imperative to confront the challenges of climate change head-on and preserve the natural wonders that enrich our lives.""

It would then go downhill in a big hurry after the senator asked a few basic questions including: What is carbon dioxide? How much will it cost to go carbon-neutral? What, exactly, is it you want us to do?

""Democrats want to spend $50 TRILLION to become carbon neutral & held a hearing to tell us why,"" Kennedy wrote on X. ""Dem witness: Carbon dioxide is 'a huge part of our atmosphere.' Me: 'It's actually a very small part of our atmosphere.' (0.035%) Dem witness: 'Well, okay. But, yeah. I don't know.'""

X users reacted to the brutal humiliation meted out to the overmatched skier by the folksy Louisianan.

The witness's credibility was further destroyed when Kennedy produced a selection of ideological tweets from his social media history, including one that claimed ""The 'war on drugs' was intentionally created to incarcerate black people en masse,"" sounding more like a member of ""The Squad"" than a climate expert.

When it comes to to the total value of homes at risk of flooding, the greater Miami area ranks first, with a total value of $323.9B, followed by New York ($265.2B) and Tampa ($126.2B). New Orleans leads all cities when it comes to share of property value at risk.

Unsurprisingly, cities affected by hurricane season are also the most threatened by extreme wind. When broken down by total property value, Miami is first, followed by Houston and New York. As for cities where 100% of the homes are at extreme risk from wind, Baton Rouge, Charleston, Houston, and Tampa are among 15 major metros spanning Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Louisiana.

When it comes to property values, the top three major metros threatened by wildfire are all in California - Los Angeles ($447.9B), Riverside ($445.2B) and San Francisco ($256.4B). Colorado Springs, Colorado is first when it comes to the share of value threatened (76.4%).

As for extreme heat, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area in Florida has the highest total value under severe heat risk, while a number of cities including Austin, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jacksonville, Florida; Houston, Texas; and Tampa, Florida all have a 100% share of value.

The San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley area has the highest total value of properties at extreme air quality risk, while 100% of homes in the following cities face severe air pollution: Fresno, California; Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom, California; Spokane-Spokane Valley, Washington; and Stockton, California.

""Specifically, with high risk of wildfire and hot weather, it is not surprising to find markets with the highest total value of homes at risk from severe and extreme air pollutants are predominantly concentrated in California,"" according to Realtor's report, where you can see more on the methodology.

These U.S. crimes fell the most in 2023, new FBI data shows

A Harvard study released earlier this year found that it's not just homeowners who face potentially dangerous - and costly - climate hazards. Researchers with Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that millions of rental units face climate- and weather-related threats.

""Environmental hazards such as wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and hurricanes increasingly jeopardize the health and safety of renters and threaten to damage or destroy housing,"" the American Rental Housing Report reads. ""About 41 percent of the nation's occupied rental stock (18.2 million units) is located in areas exposed to substantial weather- and climate-related threats as measured by expected annual economic losses for multiple hazards, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Risk Index.""

According to NOAA, the U.S. has experienced 377 weather and climate disasters since 1980 that cost at least $1 billion. Without addressing the human toll, the cost in damages for those events exceeds $2.670 trillion, NOAA says.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.1137254901960785,448980764,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hill_articles_341/220614c38af6cb0b7b4219db55b650d7,

For the first time in its 138-year history, Manchester hosted the brewing industry 'Oscars' which dates back to 1886 and has a rich history championing the world's best brewers and cider-makers.

Medals were awarded to beers and ciders from across the globe but two Gold medals were awarded to Manchester-based Joseph Holt, while a third was won by Bank Top Brewery in Bolton.

Silver medals were awarded to Manchester's Marble Beers and JW Lees & Co, while Moorhouses Brewery in Burnley also bagged a Silver.

The International Brewing & Cider Awards relocated to Depot Mayfield this year and - in another first - is accompanied by a public festival. The two-day International Brewing & Cider Festival will provide a rare opportunity for the public to sample the range of beers and ciders entered into the competition, including the award-winners.

The event has seen three days of deliberation from an international panel of 38 judges from around the world who were chosen to reflect the current expertise in the tasting and commercial evaluation of beers and ciders going into the market and blind tasted hundreds of beers and ciders submitted by brewers and cidermakers from around the world. It is these values that have earned it the reputation as the 'Oscars of the brewing and cider world'.

In total, 30 Gold beer medal winners were awarded, with brewers in England taking home 13, followed by Japan (6), Scotland (2), Australia (2), USA (2) plus one each for breweries in China, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and Thailand.

The judging for The International Brewing & Cider Awards took place over three days between 19 - 21 March and provided an unparalleled opportunity for brewers and cidermakers to have their products evaluated by internationally acclaimed, commercially practicing international brewers and cidermakers, led by Chair of Beer Judging, Rob McCaig and Chair of Cider Judging, Gabe Cook.

Ruth Evans MBE, Director of the International Brewing & Cider Awards, said: ""It's been an honour to recognise and celebrate the extraordinary beers and ciders across the world at our new home here in Manchester.

""We support the brewing and cidermaking industry on a not-for-profit basis, and the Awards has a long and rich history championing the best beers and ciders going into market.

""This week, we've had some of the best brewers and cidermakers in the world judge our prestigious competition and I'd like to personally thank all of them, as well as all the brewers and cidermakers who entered their products to make this year's Awards one to remember.

""We're thrilled to be able to continue to provide a platform to reward the best beers and ciders with the recognition they so truly deserve. And for the first time ever expand to launch our Festival, providing the public a chance to sample these award-winning drinks from the most extensive collection of international beers and cider in Europe.""

Rob McCaig, Chair of Beer Judging, said: ""We've had such an outstanding line up of judges from all corners of the world, and they've all done a remarkable job tasting and evaluating some of the finest beers from around the globe.

""This year proved to be one of the toughest yet to determine which of the beers were deserving of a medal. We had an exceptional amount of great quality beers enter this year, making the job of our judging panel extremely difficult. It's a shame we couldn't award more medals, as there were so many beers that were deserving of the accolade - some of which narrowly missed out.

""We saw a significant increase in entries in the Non & Low Alcohol category, which reflects the growing demand in the industry, and also saw an influx of international brewers enter the Smallpack Ale category, which is very promising. Historically, this category has often been dominated by the UK, but this year saw the inclusion of breweries from Japan, North America and South America.""

T&T's Min­is­ter of En­er­gy, Stu­art Young, has been at CER­AWeek, prob­a­bly the most pres­ti­gious glob­al an­nu­al gath­er­ing of en­er­gy in­dus­try lead­ers.

One of the main talk­ing points at the event this year, has been the is­sue of low ex­ist­ing de­mand for low car­bon hy­dro­gen in ma­jor mar­kets.

This sit­u­a­tion rep­re­sents a ma­jor op­por­tu­ni­ty for T&T: I know at first sight this might seem coun­ter­in­tu­itive but let me ex­plain.

While the im­por­tance of low car­bon hy­dro­gen in the en­er­gy tran­si­tion is uni­ver­sal­ly ac­knowl­edged, the in­dus­try is fac­ing a ""chick­en and egg"" prob­lem; there is not much ex­ist­ing de­mand for low car­bon hy­dro­gen in the ma­jor in­dus­tries that need hy­dro­gen as a feed­stock, so the po­ten­tial up­stream pro­duc­ers of low car­bon hy­dro­gen do not see much of an in­cen­tive to in­vest in its pro­duc­tion, but with­out the guar­an­teed sup­ply of low car­bon hy­dro­gen the po­ten­tial buy­ers are not in­vest­ing in up­grad­ing fa­cil­i­ties to bring in new low car­bon hy­dro­gen in ex­change for the ex­ist­ing ""grey hy­dro­gen"" from nat­ur­al gas (where the hy­dro­gen is split from the car­bon atoms in methane).

With­out the in­vest­ments go­ing in to scale up low car­bon hy­dro­gen pro­duc­tion the an­tic­i­pat­ed fall in costs, as hap­pened when wind, so­lar and oth­er re­new­ables ramped up, is not get­ting the op­por­tu­ni­ty to take place.

This means that low car­bon hy­dro­gen costs will re­main high and un­less there is a clear mar­ket ad­van­tage over com­modi­ties pro­duced with tra­di­tion­al ""grey car­bon"" it makes lit­tle sense for in­dus­tries us­ing hy­dro­gen as feed­stock to make the shift.

So, how does that cre­ate an op­por­tu­ni­ty for T&T?

Well, there are three im­por­tant fac­tors that put T&T in a unique po­si­tion, and which cre­ate an op­por­tu­ni­ty for us to take ad­van­tage of the cur­rent un­cer­tain­ty:

1) Lack of avail­abil­i­ty of tra­di­tion­al ""grey hy­dro­gen.""

In stark con­trast to most places try­ing to de­vel­op low car­bon hy­dro­gen, petro­chem­i­cal pro­duc­ers in T&T are fac­ing a sig­nif­i­cant short­fall in the avail­abil­i­ty of hy­dro­gen to­day.

In the Unit­ed States (the main fo­cus for low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment) petro­chem­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties can ac­cess as much nat­ur­al gas as they pos­si­bly need as feed­stock to pro­duce tra­di­tion­al ""grey hy­dro­gen.""

And the nat­ur­al gas prices are low: prices are down be­low US$1.70 per mmb­tu at the Hen­ry Hub in Louisiana at the time of writ­ing this ar­ti­cle.

While gas sales con­tract prices in Trinidad are not reg­u­lar­ly pub­licly re­leased, pub­lished da­ta from var­i­ous in­dus­try re­ports and state­ments from min­is­ters would sug­gest that the gas pur­chase price is high­er that this for any petro­chem­i­cal plant in Point Lisas to­day.

And per­haps even more sig­nif­i­cant­ly plants are sim­ply not able to ac­cess all of the nat­ur­al gas they re­quire to pro­duce ""grey hy­dro­gen."" So, un­like in oth­er mar­kets, in T&T there is an un­met de­mand for hy­dro­gen of any type and plants are there­fore very in­ter­est­ed in ac­cess­ing any hy­dro­gen that might be avail­able.

It is not a ques­tion of sub­sti­tut­ing tra­di­tion­al hy­dro­gen with low car­bon hy­dro­gen, but rather adding new hy­dro­gen.

2) Past in­ef­fi­cien­cy means there is po­ten­tial low car­bon elec­tric­i­ty avail­able.

Un­like most oth­er coun­tries, T&T has had more elec­tric­i­ty gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­i­ty that it needs.

This un­usu­al sit­u­a­tion came about be­cause of the de­ci­sion in 2010 to can­cel the con­struc­tion of the alu­mini­um smelter, though the mod­ern com­bined cy­cle plant to sup­ply the smelter, the TGU plant in La Brea, was still con­struct­ed.

This pow­er plant sup­plies the ma­jor­i­ty of Trinidad's base load low­er, with the oth­er less ef­fi­cient sin­gle cy­cle units be­ing brought on­line as need­ed, and es­pe­cial­ly dur­ing evening pe­ri­ods when de­mand for elec­tric­i­ty ris­es.

Putting a com­bined cy­cle gen­er­a­tion unit on ex­ist­ing sin­gle cy­cle units would count as a low car­bon source of en­er­gy once it is linked to a new hy­dro­gen elec­trol­yser (pro­duc­ing hy­dro­gen from split­ting oxy­gen in wa­ter mol­e­cules rather than car­bon in methane mol­e­cules).

The avail­abil­i­ty of sin­gle cy­cle gen­er­a­tion units in Trinidad there­fore cre­ates a great op­por­tu­ni­ty to pro­duce low car­bon hy­dro­gen.

And the large-scale so­lar project un­der con­struc­tion can al­so pro­vide new green elec­trons dur­ing the day (com­pli­ment­ing the new com­bined cy­cle source that would typ­i­cal­ly kick-in dur­ing the evening).

So, iron­i­cal­ly our past low lev­els of en­er­gy ef­fi­cien­cy can be­come a ben­e­fit to im­prove the eco­nom­ics of new low car­bon hy­dro­gen.

3) Our com­modi­ties are al­most all ex­port­ed.

One of the main dri­ving forces be­hind low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­mand is the new car­bon bor­der ad­just­ment mech­a­nisms (CBAMS) that have been put in place in the Eu­ro­pean Union and like­ly to be adopt­ed in oth­er ma­jor mar­kets in the next few years.

These mech­a­nisms tax spe­cif­ic com­modi­ties at the point of im­port, based on their car­bon in­ten­si­ty.

The prin­ci­ple be­hind these im­port tax­es is to dis­cour­age com­pa­nies from ""off­shoring"" pro­duc­tion to mar­kets that don't al­ready tax car­bon. One of the com­modi­ties set to be taxed un­der the EU CBAM is am­mo­nia.

Most am­mo­nia pro­duced in the world is not ex­port­ed, but rather sold on to neigh­bour­ing fa­cil­i­ties for fur­ther pro­cess­ing, es­pe­cial­ly for fer­tilis­er pro­duc­tion.

So, in the USA most am­mo­nia is sold do­mes­ti­cal­ly, con­vert­ed in­to fer­tilis­ers and sold to farm­ers in the USA.

Trinidad is one of the few places where our am­mo­nia is main­ly ex­port­ed by sea to in­ter­na­tion­al mar­kets.

This means that Trinidad am­mo­nia pro­duc­tion is more like­ly to be im­pact­ed by CBAMS and hence makes low­er car­bon hy­dro­gen an at­trac­tive op­tion to help re­duce po­ten­tial im­port tax­es.

These three fac­tors mean that Trinidad presents a unique op­por­tu­ni­ty for low car­bon hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment, while the rest of the world is grap­pling with find­ing ways to de­vel­op the mar­ket.

In most coun­tries low car­bon hy­dro­gen needs sig­nif­i­cant gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies to make the de­vel­op­ment pos­si­ble.

As the pre­sen­ta­tions at CER­AWeek made clear, gov­ern­ments in some of those mar­kets, es­pe­cial­ly in the Unit­ed States, are cur­rent­ly work­ing on sub­sidy pack­ages, but they are not there yet.

There are things that need to be put in place to en­sure that we can take ad­van­tage of this op­por­tu­ni­ty but the da­ta I have seen does not sug­gest we need spe­cif­ic heavy Gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies.

Es­sen­tial­ly the sub­sidy has been ""pre-paid"" through our past in­vest­ments in sin­gle cy­cle gas fired pow­er gen­er­a­tion.

One thing that is re­quired is the quick adop­tion of a na­tion­al reg­u­la­to­ry frame­work for mon­i­tor­ing, re­port­ing and ver­i­fi­ca­tion (MRV).

This will be vi­tal for com­pa­nies to be able to take cred­it for any car­bon re­duc­tion ini­tia­tives, in the con­text of CBAMS and car­bon mar­kets. This is­sue will be a ma­jor top­ic of dis­cus­sion at the up­com­ing Caribbean Sus­tain­able En­er­gy Con­fer­ence on June 10 to 12 2024.

The unique po­si­tion that Trinidad holds pro­vides a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ty to move fast and en­ter the low car­bon hy­dro­gen mar­ket quick­ly.

Ex­ist­ing am­mo­nia plants in Point Lisas do not need sig­nif­i­cant cap­i­tal in­vest­ment to be able to blend in vol­umes of hy­dro­gen from new sources (up to some­where in the re­gion of 10 to 20 per cent of cur­rent hy­dro­gen).

If we can rapid­ly jump on the unique op­por­tu­ni­ty that ex­ists, we could make a small per­cent of low hy­dro­gen avail­able and take a lead­ing glob­al role.",guardian.co.tt,news,Trinidad Guardian,,-0.3411764705882353,448980504,18,http://www.guardian.co.tt/image-3.5210519.464035.20240324121546.91dc3d7d27,

The Netflix adaptation of Liu Cixin's epic Science Fiction saga 3 Body Problem has finally premiered. To say it was eagerly and nervously anticipated is an understatement. For starters, the book is the Eastern equivalent of Dune, often considered impossible to adapt. For another thing, China premiered its own TV adaptation a year ago with thirty episodes that covered the entire first book, and that has been streaming for free worldwide ever since. And thirdly, the showrunners are David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo, the first of whom were accused of running the final two seasons of Game of Thrones to the ground, so knives are out for them and how faithful their version would be. And guess what? It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.

3 Body Problem begins like the book did - young astrophysicist Ye Wenjie (Zine Tseng) witnesses her father's persecution and death at the hands of fanatical Red Army cadres during the Cultural Revolution in China. In contemporary London, detective Clarence Shi (Benedict Wong) investigates the latest mysterious suicide of a leading scientist who was apparently seeing a countdown before he violently killed himself. Shortly after, physicist Vivian Ye (Vedette Lim) despairs over every particle accelerator on the planet, throwing up nonsensical data, effectively crippling all future advanced scientific research, and jumps to her death. Her five most gifted students gather for her funeral, mystified by her death. One of them, Augustina Salazar (Eiza González), starts to see a creepy countdown in her eyes that implies either a hallucination from a mental health crisis or, worse, the same type of countdown that ended with the death of several scientists across the world. Ye's mother turns out to be Ye Wenjie (the older version played by Rosalind Chao), who tells her other student Jim Cheng (Jess Hong), about a VR video game Vivian played before she died. Now Da Shi has to uncover a web of paranoia, murder, conspiracy, and a signal from space received decades ago.

This version of 3 Body Problem is designed for viewers who never read the book, which means Weiss, Benioff, and Woo (a veteran writer on True Blood and The Terror) have broken the books into pieces and put the story together again in a faster, more emotionally intense version that captures the first book without losing its ideas and major events. This also means a lot of creative decisions to change several main characters from Chinese citizens into a more diverse cast since it doesn't just take place in China. They still retain as many of the Chinese elements as possible since those parts are integral to the story.

The biggest flaw in this adaptation is that they rush through the story and leave not enough room for it and several major characters to breathe and let the viewers get to know them better and invest in them. Some of the best and most faithful parts of this series are the scenes set in Cultural Revolution China, where Ye Wenjie has to navigate a repressive regime, and the trauma and her despair with the evils of humanity drive her to make the decision that causes everything to happen in the series.

The first four episodes rush through the major parts of the story and the relationship of the five friends from Cambridge. This is one rare instance where ten episodes might have benefited the series instead of the usual ""eight per season"" that streamers favour now. Then in the second half of the series, 3 Body Problem slows down and finally finds its feet. The first half of the series was already breathless and heady, rushing from one plot point to another as if terrified of boring the viewer, then the second four episodes quietly sneak up on you, and the emotional gut punches start to land in ways the book never did. Weiss and Benioff are not phoning it in - they love the book, and they want to create characters you love. Whether you love them and which ones you do is up to you, but the showrunners know that a movie or TV series needs to translate abstract themes and ideas into emotional experiences for it to matter. Most viewers will be coming to this series cold without having read the books or seen the Chinese TV version. The emotions and heartbreak of the latter part of the series are for them.

I've read the books at least once and watched the Chinese TV series, so I already knew the answers to all the mysteries. I was willing to watch this version of 3 Body Problem with an open mind, and after finding the too-fast pace of the first four episodes iffy, but liked the series overall, if with caveats. This version is a different animal from the thirty-episode Chinese version and the book, but they share the same DNA. If you're open to the vibe, you might enjoy 3 Body Problem. The original book can be a bit obtuse to some readers, and the Netflix version does a good job of condensing and summarizing the most abstract scientific ideas that drive the story. For anyone with patience or obsessiveness, the most complete experience might be to read the books, all three of them, then watch the Chinese TV series, then the Netflix version. The differences between the Chinese TV series and the Netflix version are worth discussing since the changes Weiss, Benioff, and Woo made were made with a lot of thought and justification, even if you might not understand them. It's impossible to write just one review of the series because of that, so guess what? There will be more coming about the differences and ideas in 3 Body Problem. Otherwise, this is the headiest Science Fiction show of the year. It's highly unlikely there will be another like it.

You don't have to read the books if you don't want to, but if the series makes you want to, then it's more than done its job.

MUNICH - Companies and inventors filed 199 275 patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) last year, an increase of 2.9% on the previous year and the highest number to date, according to the EPO's Patent Index 2023 published March 19. This follows growth of 2.6% in 2022 and 4.7% in 2021. Patent applications, which are filed to help protect and market inventions, are an early indicator of companies' R&D investments, a press release stated by EPO.

""Our latest Patent Index shows that innovation remained vibrant around the world in 2023,"" said EPO President António Campinos. ""The EPO was entrusted with examining more applications than ever before, attesting to both the attractiveness of the European technology market and the high quality of our products and services. Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are making ever-increasing use of patents, with the share of applications from SMEs at its highest level yet last year. These businesses can also now benefit from the new Unitary Patent, which significantly improves the environment for innovation in Europe, providing a simpler and more cost-effective option for innovators to protect their inventions and bring them to the vast EU market.""

Boom in inventions in digital communication and energy technologies

The leading technical fields for patent applications at the EPO last year were digital communication (which covers technologies related to mobile networks), medical technology and computer technology. The strongest growth among all technology fields in 2023, however, was in electrical machinery, apparatus, energy (+12.2% over 2022), which covers inventions related to clean-energy technologies, including batteries (+28%). Patent activity in biotechnology (+5.9%) also continued to rise further.

Global and European trends

The top five countries of origin for European patent applications in 2023 were the United States, Germany, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea. Some 43% of the total applications came from companies and inventors from the EPO's 39 member states, while 57% originated from outside Europe.

The number of patent applications originating from the EPO's 39 member states increased again in 2023 (85,748 applications, +1.8%). European companies posted above average growth in the fields of digital communication (+10.7%), biotechnology (+6.4%), computer technology (+4.2%) and measurement (+4.0%).

Finland, Spain, UK and Italy with strongest growth in Europe

Patent applications from companies and inventors in Germany, Europe's leading country of origin, were back to growth (+1.4%) last year compared to 2022, while French firms filed slightly fewer applications (-1.5%). Patent filings from most other European countries were up. Among the larger patent filing countries (with over 5,000 applications), the highest growth came from the UK (+4.2%), Italy (+3.8%), the Netherlands (+3.5%), Switzerland (+2.7%) and Sweden (+2.0%). Even stronger increases (among European countries with over 1,000 applications) were posted by Finland (+9.2%) and Spain (+6.9%). In terms of patent applications per capita, Switzerland again led the rankings, followed by several Nordic countries.

More inventions from China and Republic of Korea

The overall growth in patent applications at the EPO in 2023 was mainly fuelled by steep increases from the Republic of Korea (+21.0%) and the People's Republic of China (+8.8% compared with 2022). The Republic of Korea entered the top five for the first time, while patent applications from China have more than doubled since 2018.

Other countries that showed significant growth in patent filings at the EPO last year, albeit from smaller volumes, include Canada (+2.6%), Brazil (+4.1%), Chinese Taipei (+5.9%), India (+8.4%) and Singapore (+22.3%).

Huawei tops applicant ranking

Huawei was again the leading applicant at the EPO in 2023 - increasing its applications significantly to over 5 000 and accounting for almost a quarter of all filings to the EPO from China. Samsung and LG were ranked No. 2 and 3, and together made up two-thirds of all European patent applications originating from the Republic of Korea. Qualcomm and Ericsson rounded out the top five. The top ten includes four companies from Europe, two from the Republic of Korea, two from the US and one from each of China and Japan.

Nearly every fourth application from Europe filed by a small company

But patents are also very important for small businesses: In 2023, 23% of patent applications to the EPO originating in Europe was filed by an individual inventor or a small or medium-sized enterprise (with fewer than 250 employees). A further 8% came from universities and public research organizations (see graph Breakdown of applicants by category). As part of its ongoing support for smaller entities, the EPO has announced new fee reductions as of April 1, 2024 for micro-enterprises, individuals, non-profits, universities and public research organizations.

Spotlight on women inventors

This year's Patent Index also looks at the contribution of women to innovation. For all patent applications filed with the EPO last year coming from Europe, 27% named at least one woman as an inventor. Among the larger European patent filing countries (with more than 2,000 applications per year), Spain (46%), France (33%) and Belgium (32%) had the highest share of patent applications naming at least one woman as inventor in 2023. In terms of technology sectors, the proportion ranged from 14% on average for patent applications in mechanical engineering to 50% in chemistry. This data can help in addressing the gaps that remain to be bridged to harness the full potential of women inventors.

Solid uptake of new Unitary Patent

Since June 1, 2023, innovators can also benefit from the Unitary Patent system - a new way to enjoy simpler and cheaper patent protection in 17 EU member states, in which a European patent has unitary legal effect and can be enforced or litigated before the new Unified Patent Court. The new system has already proven popular with patent owners: unitary protection was requested for 17.5% of all European patents granted in 2023 (more than 18,300 requests filed) and for 22.3% of those granted in the second half of 2023 after the system was launched. Patentees from Europe (39 EPO member states) had the highest uptake rate at 25.8%, followed by those from the US and China (both 10.9%), Republic of Korea (9.7%) and Japan (4.9%). The top Unitary Patent requestors in 2023 were Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Qualcomm, Samsung and Ericsson. Of the patentees who have transformed their European patents into Unitary Patents, some two-thirds are European.",agip-news.com,news,AGIP,,0.5294117647058822,448980178,1,,
8044987239,eng,False,2024-03-24,12:39:29,2024-03-24T12:39:29Z,2024-03-24T12:39:19Z,news,0.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24032024/direct-lithium-extraction-green-river-utah/,"Mining Companies Say They Have a Better Way to Get Underground Lithium, but Skepticism Remains - Inside Climate News","GREEN RIVER, Utah -- When Kelly Dunham heard that water was gushing out from a test well earlier this month for a proposed lithium mine in the middle of this rural city of 900 residents, she went to see it for herself.

Water was surging from the drilling rig and flooding the test site as berms trapped it and directed the water toward lagoons once used by an abandoned missile launch complex nearby. Trucks sucked up the water with pumps and hauled it away to disposal wells as fast as they could.

The drill had hit pockets of carbon dioxide gas and more water than expected, according to state regulators and Anson Resources, the company behind the direct lithium extraction (DLE) project in which brine is pumped from deep aquifers to the surface, where lithium and other minerals are extracted from the water before it is sent back underground.

This process for acquiring lithium without as many environmental impacts as hard rock mining is gaining momentum, but uncertainty looms over how it will be done at scale in the U.S.

An incident like the blowout that occurred on March 8 is what locals like Dunham, a lifelong Green River resident, and environmentalists had been fearing. Green River gets its name from the waterway that runs through town, which is the biggest tributary of the Colorado River.

The company behind the project has said it would have no impact on local water supplies and the brine water from which they were seeking to extract lithium -- the soft, silvery metal that is critical to the batteries for electric vehicles and solar and wind farm energy storage projects -- would be returned to underground aquifers and not contaminate surface supplies. But here in early March, before any final permits for the project had been issued, was water rushing out of a drill site only a short distance from a wash that feeds into the river.

State agencies and Anson Resources said the water itself was not saline enough to have any potential impacts on humans and had not reached local washes or the river. But residents like Dunham worry about what happens when they begin to drill deeper.

The blowout had occurred at 1,500 feet underground; if permitted, the company plans to drill down up to 10,000 feet, and the water it pumps up will go from having 1,800 parts per million of chloride assay to over 300,000 ppm, levels highly toxic for human consumption -- fresh water has just 1,000 ppm. If that water were to reach the Green River, it could put Utah in violation of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, which regulates the levels of salts allowed in the river that supplies water for over 40 million people and irrigates millions of acres of farmland in the U.S. and Mexico.

The March 2024 blowout may not have caused any lasting harm, locals and environmentalists said, but what about the next one?

It's just one of the many questions concerned residents here have. Are the brine aquifers connected to the Green River? How will extracting the brine impact more shallow groundwater and surface water? What chemicals are used in the mining process? Could the process affect local ecosystems?

""I don't think the community really knows what's going on,"" Dunham said. ""Everybody really does just want jobs. Unfortunately, most people are just surviving. And when you're in survival mode, you really aren't as concerned about the environment.""

By drilling wells to pump up brine rather than digging huge holes into the ground to extract rock, the industry cites direct lithium extraction as a way to acquire the element critical to the energy transition without the environmental impacts of mining.

""Our process is efficient, we use less water than other manufacturing and lithium mining operations, we produce less carbon dioxide than hard rock mining,"" said Bruce Richardson, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Anson Resources, in a statement.

The process they use to remove minerals from brine would also produce less carbon dioxide than evaporation ponds, which draw lithium from brine by letting the water evaporate, he stated. ""We are utilizing existing structures and land usage areas smartly to reduce our footprint, and we are using a closed loop process so there is no risk of accidental spills,"" he said. ""Because the lithium we are extracting will go into electric vehicles, and the whole point of them is to have a lower impact on the environment, we're operating from that same point of view.""

""Unfortunately, most people are just surviving. And when you're in survival mode, you really aren't as concerned about the environment.""

But proving that it will be better for the environment -- in Green River and where other DLE projects are proposed from California to Arkansas -- is easier said than done. The technology has yet to be used at an operational scale in the U.S. and uncertainty exists over how the projects may impact fresh water supplies, a big issue in Utah and the Southwest, a region facing declining aquifers and decreasing flows on major rivers like the Colorado.

""We are not opposed to lithium,"" said Kyle Roerink, the executive director for the Great Basin Water Network, an organization focused on water issues in Nevada and Utah that is monitoring DLE proposals across Utah, including on the Great Salt Lake and in Green River. ""We are opposed to unsustainable and dangerous appropriations of water under the false assumptions that this new technology is absolutely harmless.""

Thousands of feet below eastern Utah, layers of rock have trapped seawater containing traces of lithium for more than 300 million years.

The process of extracting the mineral using DLE has existed for decades, and similar technology has been used to extract other minerals, though it is just being proposed as a less environmentally destructive alternative to mining for lithium.

Generally, DLE requires a well to extract brine water from which a chemical process extracts the lithium and other potentially desirable minerals via an ion exchange. But each operation is different, with variations in the chemicals required and how much freshwater is needed to extract the lithium, experts said.

""The notion that you see on websites for companies is 'Here comes the brine water and the magic chemical tweezers pull only this out and everything else goes back in the earth,"" said Corby Anderson, director of the Kroll Institute For Extractive Metallurgy at the Colorado School of Mines. ""This is not true. That's not how it works.""

Depending on the process, a DLE operation could see a net positive or net negative in its freshwater consumption, Anderson said, as some facilities may require more filtration of the minerals, pH adjustments, reverse osmosis and even evaporation processes.

That can lead to big fluctuations in how much fresh water various DLE operations consume, even if they use less brine water compared to other methods.

""DLE in theory would use or waste significantly a lot less water in total,"" said Daniel Saftner, a hydrogeologist at the Desert Research Institute who co-authored a report on how lithium mining could impact water supplies in Nevada. ""However, it's possible that DLE could use more freshwater.""

For its Green River project, Anson Resources has partnered with Sunresin, a Chinese-based ion exchange technology company.

According to Anson, natural pressure will send the brine water filled with lithium to a tank on the surface filled with an absorbent material that ""looks like instant coffee,"" which will extract the lithium over six hours. Then the spent brine water is sent back into the ground, making the process a ""nonconsumptive use."" Fresh water from the Green River is used to flush the tank and that lithium-filled water is pumped to a closed system that removes the metal ions. An evaporator then recycles the Green River water for use in the next batch.

Anson has acquired 2,500 acre-feet of Green River water from various entities for the process. The company claims it plans to recycle at least 90 percent of the water used during the operation and that only 10 percent of its water rights will be used a year. It is also seeking a permit allowing it to use 13,000 acre feet of the brine water under a nonconsumptive use application for the Green River project.

With no DLE mines in operation in the U.S., however, it remains difficult to gauge how they might impact local environments and water supplies. ""The environmental impacts are still unknown and will likely vary by location,"" Saftner said.

The Desert Research Institute's report on lithium mining's potential impacts on hydrology, which Saftner helped co-author, identified DLE as likely the most environmentally friendly option in most cases. That's because, in an ideal scenario, a DLE operation can be integrated into existing infrastructure, such as at a geothermal power plant or a groundwater pumping facility, and typically doesn't require land-intensive evaporation ponds, which are used in another method of extracting lithium from brine water.

However, if a DLE site is being proposed and requires new infrastructure, it becomes murkier over whether it's better than other existing methods.

New DLE projects also provide the option for acquiring other resources. Anson plans to extract bromine from the Green River project and says it could potentially generate hydropower from the pressure the brine water produces when being sent to the surface.

Making the economics work for DLE projects will be key, said Jeremy Pearson, the director of the San Rafael Energy Research Center, who has closely been following the proposals in Utah. To him, DLE could be used to extract a valuable mineral, and rather than send the spent brine back into the earth, desalinating it so it could bolster water supplies in the drought-stricken Southwest.

""The economics have to work,"" he said. ""But if you get those economics to work, I see that as the future.""

Economics mean nothing, however, if a community won't buy into a project.

Sometimes development needs to be delayed so companies can build trust in communities, Pearson said. ""But what good is the development if everyone's living in fear?"" he asked.

A lack of trust and clarity over what the potential impacts could be is driving much of the concern over the Green River project.

""This community is basically an experimental community"" for testing DLE at scale, said John Weisheit, conservation director of Living Rivers-Colorado Riverkeeper, at a public meeting for the project in late February. Questions over the risk for well failures and how the chemicals used in the process would be disposed of had not been answered, he said, and regulators were allowing a ""very big project in the wrong place.""

""Decision makers are making serious missteps that could lead to future litigation,"" Weisheit said.

The state's declaration of limited water supplies in the region is the basis for some of the environmental groups' concerns. ""The water resources of this area are considered to be limited,"" reads a web page for the area's surface- and groundwater supplies. ""New appropriations are limited to small amounts of beneficial use sufficient to serve the domestic requirements of one family, the irrigation of one acre, and ten head of livestock."" But nonconsumptive uses of water are ""considered on the individual merits of each application,"" which would apply to the DLE project.

Utah's water laws, however, did not foresee projects like this one, said Roerink with the Great Basin Water Network, and the verdict is still out on whether the use of the brine water will be consumptive or not. Roerink added that laws were just passed in the current legislative session requiring state agencies to develop rules for brine mining operations dealing with safety, the development of multiple minerals at a site and the spacing of wells, opening the door for potentially more DLE operations in the state.

Brine water is too saline for drinking or use in agriculture or industrial settings. But brine aquifers can be interconnected with other water supplies that people can use, so the consumption of brine water can trickle up to impact the water rights of other entities.

State regulators and Anson say the brine aquifers the company will use for DLE aren't connected to other sources of water, but environmentalists and federal agencies have questioned that claim.

And though many DLE projects plan to reinject the brine back into aquifers once the lithium is extracted, the chemical composition may have changed to alter lithium concentrations in the deep aquifers it returns to or, if it's sent into a more shallow groundwater reservoir, impact connected aquatic ecosystems.

""Introducing foreign water to an aquifer is going to change its water quality,"" Saftner said, which could have a ""potential ripple effect"" if those aquifers are connected to wetlands or feed local surface waters.

Anson plans to reinject the spent brine into a higher aquifer to not dilute the lithium they plan to extract. A spokesperson for the company did not answer how that new source of water could impact the aquifer it is sent to.

Concerns over DLE's impact on water and the environment are not unique to Green River, with projects around the country encountering concerns over their potential environmental impacts and skepticism over how the technology works.

Oil giant Exxon Mobil announced late last year it would be drilling for lithium in a southern Arkansas town where the fossil fuel industry once employed most of the residents, citing the ability to use oil and gas drilling methods. Multiple companies have proposed DLE operations on the Great Salt Lake, prompting concern over taking more water out of a lake that in recent years has verged on the edge of collapse.

At the Salton Sea in Southern California, geothermal plants, which use hot brine to create energy, propose to extract the lithium from the water using DLE, allowing facilities to both create energy and source the mineral needed to store it. The Imperial Valley, home of the Salton Sea, has enough lithium by itself to satisfy the nation's needs, a recent study found. However, locals and environmental groups have raised concerns over the amount of Colorado River water needed to make the operations work and how DLE projects may impact communities that already face health impacts from the region's poor air quality stemming from the degradation of the sea.

The Imperial Valley Irrigation District -- which uses the largest share of the Colorado River's water -- has 25,000 acre feet earmarked for industrial purposes, like mining. There's enough water available for ""Hell's Kitchen,"" one of the projects closest to being constructed, but not enough for others, said Jared Naimark, a mining organizer in California for Earthworks who has worked with local communities in Imperial Valley regarding lithium projects.

That means if more are to be built, they'll need to acquire water from local farms. If less water goes to agriculture, the Salton Sea, which receives most of its water from agricultural drainage, could have its supply diminished. That's an issue because as the Salton Sea shrinks, it exposes the lake bed -- filled with toxic chemicals from years of drainage from local farms -- to worsen the region's air quality and degrade the health of the local population.

""In these cases, where you have extreme drought and limited Colorado River supply, and all of the complex trade-offs involved in that, that needs to be a part of that analysis"" for these projects, Neimark said. ""The fact that this is potentially better than some other form of extraction shouldn't be an excuse to get around or reverse environmental review.""

Those concerns were not addressed in the environmental impact statement completed for the project, community and environmental groups said, resulting in a petition filed March 14 against the county, alleging that the approval of the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act and failed to properly consult local tribes as required under the law.

As climate change and overconsumption sip away at the region's water supplies, any project involving water, including for mining, will be fiercely debated. Across the Southwest, it's a dispute that's been raging for years, as mines for minerals needed for the renewable energy transition could potentially impact local water quantity and quality and comes as states reckon with declining aquifers and engage in tense debates over large cutbacks on the Colorado River.

Green River water -- which feeds the Colorado -- grew the small community where Anson is planning its DLE mine. Large farms surround the town. It has a museum dedicated to the river and John Wesley Powell, the Civil War officer who famously first floated and mapped it. Its Melon Days Festival celebrates the area's famous cantaloupes, honeydews, canaries and watermelons. Many of its residents are eager for new jobs and support the energy transition, but only after ensuring the water that's been vital to the town's history and economy won't suffer in the process.",insideclimatenews.org,news,InsideClimate News,Derek Harrison,-0.2156862745098039,448979969,1,https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Green-River-1_Courtesy-1024x683.jpg,

In recent years, the inclusion of AI (Artificial Intelligence) has presented a promising opportunity to enhance the tax compliance process further. Businesses across the globe are adopting AI and intelligent automation to meet increasing expectations from boards and tax administrations, as well as automating complex processes in the tax world.

Despite the indispensable role of human oversight in ensuring trust and accuracy in finance, AI in its current form augments human capabilities and drives efficiency. Moreover, as businesses expand into new markets and navigate complex cross-border compliance requirements, such as Harmonized System (HS) codes, the adoption of AI becomes increasingly pertinent. Businesses aiming to enhance financial efficiency and streamline tax-related tasks can leverage the potential of AI technology.

AI supports Harmonized System (HS) code classification

Global cross-border e-commerce surpassed $1 trillion in 2023, making the importance of having balanced trade systems greater than ever. The Harmonized System (HS), a standardized method for classifying traded products, plays a key role here, but classifying and assigning the correct HS code can be challenging for businesses. Leveraging AI, businesses can automate the classification of HS codes, and the technology can learn as HS code rules change. AI integration into managing HS codes is transformative, utilizing its learning capabilities to make accurate predictions.

Moreover, AI enhances the product classification process, cutting down on the time required to seek guidance from human tax experts. This leads to businesses benefiting from increased efficiency and speed around classifications and reduced misclassification risks often associated with human error.

Helping drive efficiency in tax management

The current global tax landscape demands increased transparency and collaboration among tax authorities globally, resulting in a surge in business compliance burdens. This heightened complexity and potential tax risks call for more strong solutions. AI is an important tool to address these obstacles, offering improved data efficiency and enhanced productivity.

As businesses, both large and small, embrace tax digitization, adopting AI-driven tax automation systems is becoming a standard practice. For example, in India, start-ups have already started leveraging AI to provide accounting, customer management, and marketing solutions to simplify tax filings.

Automation and AI gradually replace manual processes, transforming organizations into more service-oriented entities. While human involvement remains vital for trust and accuracy in finance, AI enhances human efficiency.

Supporting end-to-end tax compliance

Tax processes are notoriously complex, but AI and ML (Machine Learning) increasingly focus on this complexity. Many aspects of tax functions rely on human expertise developed over the years to grasp the nuances in regulations and administrative rulings. Due to the intricacies involved, the adoption of AI and ML is finding its way into tax-related activities.

However, AI offers significant efficiency gains by consuming large volumes of tax information and utilizing extraction techniques. This can save businesses up to 30-40% of the time typically spent on such tasks. AI, powered by ML algorithms, can categorize entities into different groups, similar to automated customer segmentation. Beyond this, AI can also categorize tax notices, letters, or contract clauses, thereby saving time that would otherwise be spent on reading these documents.

Moreover, AI-powered product taxonomy allows scope for precise categorization forecasts based on category ID and taxonomy tags. Employing machine learning for product classification prevents costly manual errors. Dealing with a large volume of products from various countries and retailers presents ample opportunity for mistakes. An AI-driven system utilizes data such as manufacturer details and product descriptions to ensure customized classification and accurate tariff codes automatically. The machine-learning classification module adapts to each country's code in the Harmonized System, facilitating flawless shipments worldwide.

Furthermore, advanced AI has entered the tax function, offering numerous practical applications from academic research and professional service firms. While it may seem improbable that AI robots will replace human tax accountants, AI applications will likely play an important role in assisting tax experts. These applications can aid in error detection, transaction classification, audit risk estimation, and proposing advantageous tax strategies within complex global legal frameworks.

What's Next

Globally, the integration of AI assistants in the tax compliance sector is likely to rise, handling diverse tasks such as data analysis and anomaly audits and supporting tax research and filing processes. AI helps automate manual cross-border compliance activities to improve operational efficiencies, minimize errors, and enable commerce.

We're still in the early days of AI in tax, meaning businesses can expect more value from the technology as we move forward. For companies looking to move into new markets, AI will serve as another key tool like automation to streamline tax management and offload time and resource-intensive work from teams. Businesses looking to succeed in a global economy should leverage automation technology to address today's compliance requirements and explore AI's capabilities to solve tomorrow's requirements.",financialexpress.com,news,The Financial Express,,0.5607843137254902,448979898,1,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Artificial-Intelligence-1.png,eng-9419058

(NYSE:SWX) Revenue Forecasts By 30%","Shareholders in Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SWX) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.

Following this upgrade, Southwest Gas Holdings' twin analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$5.5b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 60% to US$3.37. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.20 in 2024. The most recent forecasts are noticeably more optimistic, with a sizeable gain to revenue estimates and a lift to earnings per share as well.

Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Gas Holdings

Although the analysts have upgraded their earnings estimates, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$72.28, suggesting that the forecast performance does not have a long term impact on the company's valuation.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Southwest Gas Holdings' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 1.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 15% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 7.4% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Southwest Gas Holdings is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.

The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Pleasantly, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow slower than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at Southwest Gas Holdings.

Sapit who is the primate of the Anglican Church in Kenya made the call in his Palm Sunday Homily at the All Saints' Cathedral in Nairobi where he emphasized the need for concerted efforts to protect the environment.

He noted that the world is suffering from the effects of climate change because of what he described as the selfish interests of human beings in their pursuit of worldly possessions.

""The call now is for all of us to green the world again and use green energy as opposed to fossil fuels that release and emit carbon into the atmosphere, damaging our world,"" he said.

Sapit further appealed to Kenyans to make noble decisions and take individual responsibility to correct the wrongs and transform the world for the better.

The Archbishop also called on politicians to demonstrate servant leadership in their dealings, urging the government to ensure prudent utilization of taxes.

""We expect, with the many taxes that have been introduced, will be translated into service delivery so that it is brought back to us in the form of free education, goods drugs in our hospitals, quality services, good roads and opportunities to grow and thrive as a people,"" he added.

""But if it is not translated then the labour of every Kenyan will be labour in vain.""

The Archbishop further called out some leaders for not taking their oversight role seriously and failing Kenyans by championing better policies that would contribute to the growth of the nation and her citizenry.

He singled out the recent admission by some leaders on failure to peruse thoroughly through crucial policy documents including the Affordable Housing Bill.

""I think it was just last week, I read from a news item one of our national leaders of the National assembly saying we passed a bill without reading it,"" he said.

""What a shame!"" Sapit remarked.

The Archbishop stated that Kenyans expect their leaders to read ""every word in every bill"" so that the decisions they make in those bills become noble decisions on behalf of Kenyans and ""the decision to make Kenya a great nation but not a crying nation.""

Further, Archbishop Sapit noted that transformative leadership will have a ripple effect when properly embraced and can transform and give Kenyans hope.

We call upon ourselves and those who are leading and managing the affairs of our nation, that we need to be all noble leaders.

He asked the policymakers and all those tasked with managing the affairs of the country to use the nobility to make noble decisions that will spur growth and development.

""When we do that, we shall have a nation that is going to be self-sustaining, healthy, prosperous and a nation that is going to spread the message of hope,"" he added.

Sapit called on the leaders in the country to learn from the sacrifice of Jesus whom he said willingly suffered for the sake of the world.

""The call to us in leadership is how much are we suffering for the need of the people of this country or we make them suffer for them to enjoy.""

He observed that leadership is a call to servanthood and a call to sacrifice for the needs of others.

Earlier in the day, the Archbishop led a procession to the city centre to commemorate Jesus' triumphant entry to Jerusalem.

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

The FDIC on Thursday proposed new rules that would add further scrutiny to a potential deal. The plan, if ultimately approved, would now look at financial stability, communities, competition, and anti-money laundering compliance as part of the regulator's review of a potential combination.

""The Thursday proposal represents yet another M&A view in DC that Big = Bad and is the latest in the hurdles being established to delay and/or prevent bank M&A for firms above $100B in assets,"" Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote in a note on Thursday. ""We would expect that we ultimately will see consolidation among these banks, but the timing and regulatory hurdles are set to increase.""

The draft rule was issued Thursday on a 3-2 vote, with the board's two Republican members voting against it. This means that the new rule is unlikely to be implemented if Republicans retake the White House in the November election, according to Mills.

""The timing of the proposal would mean that a potential Republican administration would be able to withdraw or significantly modify the initial proposal, with a Republican House and Senate adding to the potential for a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution that would overturn the rule,"" Mills added. ""Overall, we continue to anticipate that deals that are smaller in size and with a specific focus will continue to be the most likely candidates for deal approval.""

After the FDIC voted Thursday to formally propose the new banking M&A rules, it will be open for public comment for 60 days.

""This proposed Statement of Policy would update, strengthen, and clarify the FDIC's approach to evaluating mergers under the Bank Merger Act,"" FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said in a statement on Thursday. ""Given the rapid pace of change and consolidation in the banking industry today, it is vital that the FDIC provide guidance on how it would apply the critical statutory factors under the Bank Merger Act relating to competition, financial resources, the convenience and needs of communities, financial stability, and money laundering.""

The potential new FDIC bank M&A rules come after the Justice Department announced in June that it's evaluating new guidelines for bank mergers, saying times have changed since the latest rules were announced almost 30 years ago. The DOJ plans to closely scrutinize mergers that increase risks associated with ""coordinated effects and multi-market contact,"" Jonathan Kanter, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, said at the time. The regulator will also consider how a proposed merger may affect competition for different customer segments.

The draft FDIC rules also come as Capital One (NYSE:COF) attempts to make one of the biggest credit deals in the last few decades with its proposed $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS). The all-stock deal unveiled last month is set to create the biggest U.S.-based card issuer by balances. But lawmakers have condemned the move, citing concerns about reduced competition and higher fees and credit costs for consumers.

He branded the policy as ""super racist"" for setting a 7% limit on employment-based green cards for each country. The law, which was instituted in the 1960s, has remained unaltered since its creation.

Notably, Musk's comments come as Indian-American organizations like the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora (FIIDS) have demanded the elimination of the per-country quota on green cards. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Congressman Matt Cartwright also echoed this demand, emphasizing the importance of immigrants in the US and saying that the country ""depends on high-quality, highly skilled, and smart labor."" ""It's one of the natural advantages of the United States that we welcome people from all over the world,"" he said.

Country-specific caps have predominantly impacted many immigrants from Asian countries, especially India and China. It also resulted in significant backlogs of applicants. According to reports, over one million people are currently in limbo in different states of America due to employment-based green card backlogs. The group includes dependent spouses and children. They are the ones most affected by this policy.

Musk's condemnation of the policy came in response to an X post that said, ""Every month DoS [US Department of State] shamelessly publishes cut-off dates that separate Chinese and Indian born from Rest of the World."" Musk remarked, ""Yup, super racist"". His comments ignited agreement among numerous social media users.

EDMONTON -- Bodies and minds are just as affected by climate change as sea ice and forests, says University of Alberta scientist Sherilee Harper.

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

The International Seabed Authority is under increasing pressure, caught between mining interests and environmentalists

Greenpeace environmental campaigners this weekend face the prospect of being kicked out of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) meeting currently being held in Jamaica. According to Michael Lodge, ISA secretary general, their protests around an exploration vessel posed “a serious threat … to the marine environment”.

The row is over deep-sea mining. The offended party is the Vancouver-based The Metals Company (TMC), as it lobbies the authority to be allowed to start mining for potato-sized polymetallic nodules that litter the Pacific seabed in their millions in what is called the Clarion-Clipperton zone, lying between Hawaii and Mexico.

TMC complained that Greenpeace activists disrupted one of its research expeditions when they boarded its vessel. Greenpeace campaigner Louisa Casson is indignant: “If Michael Lodge had put as much effort into properly scrutinising deep-sea mining companies and ensuring transparent negotiations as he has chasing dissent, a pristine ecosystem would have a fair chance to remain undisturbed,” he said.

For some, this may seem like a storm in a teacup, but for both the obscure ISA and environmentalists, the stakes run high. Greenpeace calls the Jamaica meeting, which finishes on March 29, “a critical moment for the future of the oceans”.

Deposits, rich in cobalt, nickel, copper and magnesium, were built up on the deep ocean floor 4km-6km below the surface over millions of years. The Clarion-Clipperton zone alone covers 4.5 million sq km, and may be home to 21 billion tonnes of polymetallic nodules – more cobalt and nickel than all the world’s terrestrial mines combined. Estimates put the gross value of these deep-sea resources at between US$8 trillion and US$16 trillion.

Companies like TMC say these resources are desperately needed for the green technology developments playing a critical role in reducing carbon emissions and tackling global warming.

They say land-based sources of these metals are rapidly running out, and are anyway dangerously concentrated in a small group of countries – Congo for cobalt; Indonesia and the Philippines for nickel; and Chile for copper. A World Bank report said demand for these battery metals could rise fivefold by 2050.

But environmentalists are pushing back. The abyssal plain that covers 40 per cent of the Earth’s surface (land covers about 29 per cent), provides the bedrock of the benthic ecosystem that is still largely unknown to science.

While mining companies might assume that these cold dark depths are empty of life, researchers have found “significant undescribed biodiversity … at deep taxonomic levels”.

Opponents to deep-sea mining say our ignorance alone demands extreme caution. They argue that disturbing the seabed and raising tonnes of sediment could at the simplest level clog the gills of fish and suffocate coral.

It could also release toxic and potentially radioactive minerals into the open ocean and disturb vast reservoirs of stored carbon dioxide. The French National Centre for Scientific Research’s CNRS News noted that “one of the greatest fears scientists have … is that ecosystems will be wiped out before they have even been discovered”.

Even TMC, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in 2022, conceded that operations “are certain to disturb wildlife in the operating area”, adding: “The nature and severity of these impacts … are expected to vary by species and are currently subject to significant uncertainty.”

It said that such effects “may never be completely and definitively known. … It is also currently not definitively known how the risk of biodiversity loss in the CCZ could be eliminated or reduced through mitigation strategies or how long it will take for disturbed seabed areas to recover naturally.”

With potentially mouthwatering opportunities for mining companies like TMC, the pressure on the ISA continues to mount. Countries ranging from China and Russia to South Korea and India have 31 exploration licences and are waiting increasingly impatiently for rules governing deep-sea mining.

The ISA is nervously aware of its statutory obligation to ensure the world’s international waters remain “the common heritage of mankind”, and that exploitation “shall … be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole” – constraints not dissimilar from those on the exploration of space, or the Arctic and Antarctic. A 225-page working draft of regulations on exploitation of mineral resources was tabled in February, and is being discussed at the Jamaica meeting.UN must take lead to curb damage from deep-sea mining frenzy

The ISA’s problem is that 24 countries are currently demanding a moratorium on deep-sea mining. It plans to finalise the rules in July. Until then, the miners will probably have to wait.

One irony is that, for these negotiations, the US is not in the room. It has not signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to which the ISA answers, and so has no voice. This has nevertheless not prevented mounting pressure from the US security establishment to ensure “the ability to source critical minerals in innovative areas to decrease reliance on sources from foreign adversaries”. At present, it is confined to looking at seabed mining inside its territorial waters.

By the time you read this, it is possible that Greenpeace will have been booted out of the ISA negotiations. However, one can’t help but think that the threat to our deep oceans sits more inside the room than out.

The 2024 Realtor.com Housing and Climate Risk Report found that more than 44.8% of the country's homes face at least one kind of ""severe or extreme climate risk"" from either flood, wind, wildfire, heat or air quality. The total value of those homes is nearly $22 trillion, according to the study.

""It's important for people to fully understand the climate risks that a home faces not only in the present, but in the future, so they can make the most informed decision for one of the biggest purchases and investments they will make in their life,"" said Realtor.com's Mausam Bhatt, chief product and technology officer, in a statement.

Realtor.com recently rolled out climate factor risk scores using data from the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit climate technology company, that forecasts the likelihood of a given disaster over the next 30 years.

When it comes to to the total value of homes at risk of flooding, the greater Miami area ranks first, with a total value of $323.9B, followed by New York ($265.2B) and Tampa ($126.2B). New Orleans leads all cities when it comes to share of property value at risk.

Unsurprisingly, cities affected by hurricane season are also the most threatened by extreme wind. When broken down by total property value, Miami is first, followed by Houston and New York. As for cities where 100% of the homes are at extreme risk from wind, Baton Rouge, Charleston, Houston, and Tampa are among 15 major metros spanning Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Louisiana.

When it comes to property values, the top three major metros threatened by wildfire are all in California - Los Angeles ($447.9B), Riverside ($445.2B) and San Francisco ($256.4B). Colorado Springs, Colorado is first when it comes to the share of value threatened (76.4%).

As for extreme heat, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area in Florida has the highest total value under severe heat risk, while a number of cities including Austin, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jacksonville, Florida; Houston, Texas; and Tampa, Florida all have a 100% share of value.

The San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley area has the highest total value of properties at extreme air quality risk, while 100% of homes in the following cities face severe air pollution: Fresno, California; Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom, California; Spokane-Spokane Valley, Washington; and Stockton, California.

""Specifically, with high risk of wildfire and hot weather, it is not surprising to find markets with the highest total value of homes at risk from severe and extreme air pollutants are predominantly concentrated in California,"" according to Realtor's report, where you can see more on the methodology.

A Harvard study released earlier this year found that it's not just homeowners who face potentially dangerous - and costly - climate hazards. Researchers with Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that millions of rental units face climate- and weather-related threats.

""Environmental hazards such as wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and hurricanes increasingly jeopardize the health and safety of renters and threaten to damage or destroy housing,"" the American Rental Housing Report reads. ""About 41 percent of the nation's occupied rental stock (18.2 million units) is located in areas exposed to substantial weather- and climate-related threats as measured by expected annual economic losses for multiple hazards, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Risk Index.""

According to NOAA, the U.S. has experienced 377 weather and climate disasters since 1980 that cost at least $1 billion. Without addressing the human toll, the cost in damages for those events exceeds $2.670 trillion, NOAA says.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,-0.1529411764705882,448979541,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1634240695.jpg?strip=1&w=640,

At a working session with the Standing Board of the provincial Party Committee on March 24, PM Chinh said, with unique potential and competitive advantages, Tien Giang is well-positioned to develop its industries, trade and services, acting as one of the key growth poles in the Mekong Delta.

He asked the province to effectively carry out the 13th National Party Congress's Resolution and the Party's policies and guidelines on orientations to the region's socio-economic development, national defence-security; the State's policies and laws, the Government and PM's directions and Resolution adopted by the provincial Party Congress.

Tien Giang must pursue faster and more sustainable development, relying on sci-tech, green transition, sharing and circular economy, and e-commerce, he said, adding that it must also reform administrative procedures, improve the local business environment by building a healthy, transparent and united administrative system.

Looking ahead, the province was tasked with effectively carrying out its master planning scheme for the 2021-2030 period, with a vision to 2050, with a focus on socio-economic infrastructure via foreign direct investment and public-private partnerships.

Its rankings in indices reflecting the business and investment environment must be improved, such as the Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI), the Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI), the Public Administration Reform Index (PAR INDEX), alongside provincial-level digital transformation and innovation rankings.

The provincial Party Organisation was assigned to pay attention to building a strong and clean Party and political system while fighting corruption, negative phenomena and wastefulness.

Vowing to deal with the province's proposals, delegates suggested that Tien Giang should focus on overcoming challenges posed by climate change, landslides, subsidence and saline intrusion.

They also advised the province to pool all resources for strategic infrastructure development, and build major industrial hubs for manufacturing and processing, agro-aquatic product processing, and strengthening connectivity between local production and supply chains with regional and global markets./.",en.vietnamplus.vn,news,VietnamPlus,,0.6470588235294117,448979530,1,,

Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein held talks with US envoy Amos Hochstein in the capital Baghdad on Sunday to discuss regional tensions and their impact on oil prices.

The talks focused on regional conflicts and their effect on energy prices as well as investments in the Iraqi oil fields, the state news agency INA reported.

Hochstein said Washington is ready to enhance cooperation with Iraq, especially in oil and gas fields, the broadcaster said.

Iraq is estimated to have a stockpile of 132 trillion cubic feet of gas, 700 billion of which were burnt due to lack of exploitation.

Iraq seeks to place itself as a gas exporter by 2025.

Tension has escalated across the region amid Israel's deadly offensive on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 32,200 people since last October.

The Gaza conflict has spilled over to Yemen, where the Houthi group has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, one of the world's most frequently used sea routes for oil and fuel shipments.

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

It has been made to reflect the aspirations and priorities of the Down Ampney community.

An overwhelming majority, 95.6 per cent, of votes cast in favour of the plan during the public referendum held in February.

One of the most notable features of the plan is the designation of Duke's Meadow as a Local Green Space, a move aimed at securing its future amidst development pressures.

Commenting on the significance of this achievement, Juliet Layton, cabinet member for planning and regulatory services, said: ""The Down Ampney Neighbourhood Plan stands as a testament to the power of community-driven initiatives in shaping the future landscape of our towns and villages.

""With its locally distinctive policies and forward-thinking vision, the plan sets out the case for sustainable development and responsible stewardship of our natural and cultural heritage.

""My heartfelt congratulations go out to the Down Ampney Parish Council and all the dedicated individuals who have played a vital role in its development.""

Andrew Scarth, chair of the Down Ampney Steering Group, said: ""After four years of work, the Down Ampney Neighbourhood Plan has been created and is now in force.

""The Steering Group would like to thank Down Ampney Parish Council, Cotswold District Council, and of course, the villagers of Down Ampney for all their assistance and support in achieving this important goal.""

Gareth Cope, chair of Down Ampney Parish Council, said: ""The benefits of having the Neighbourhood Plan include protection for Duke's Meadow - our remaining green space in the centre of the village.

""Now that it is designated as Local Green Space it offers significant protection from any future development.

""Through the Down Ampney Design Guide we can now influence where future developments are and what type and style of houses are built.""

Adrian Lasimbang was former Upko Penampang Youth movement chief. He left the party and joined DAP when he was appointed senator from Sabah from 2018 to 2021.

Lasimbang is an innovator and is the founder of Tonibung and Centre for Renewable Energy and Appropriate Technologies which is dedicated to conducting research and development for small-scale RE systems for Rural applications.

Upko president Datuk Ewon Benedick who spoke to the media after handing over the party membership card on Sunday to Lasimbang, expressed gratitude to the latter for rejoining the party.

""Adrian's participation in Upko will be an added value to the party's struggles, especially in innovation, entrepreneurship and issues about environment and climate change. This is in line with the (federal) government's vision among which is participating in the Climate Club and looking for resolutions to environmental issues.

""Adrian who is an activist in climate change and environmental issues, will be able to give me his opinions, suggestions and criticism on these matters which I can bring up to the federal cabinet if needed as well as on other platforms given to the party,"" he said.

Ewon is confident that the participation of more former members and leaders will make Upko stronger and better.

He also welcomes fellow Sabahans who are interested in adding value to Upko to join the party.

Meanwhile Ewon said Upko's Executive Committee had a meeting earlier and among the decisions made were on the party's convention and Kaamatan celebration.

Upko's convention, he said, will be held in Kota Kinabalu on August 10 and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will be invited to deliver the keynote address at the meeting.

""We have also decided to celebrate Upko's 30th anniversary on August 9. For the party's Kaamatan festival celebration this year, we decided that it would be held on May 11 and 12.

Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.

Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.

Now the seismic settlement between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents' role, as people in other jobs - from the world of finance to travel - have already experienced.

Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers' agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.

""I think we are reaching a point where there's going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,"" Piskorski said. ""One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?""

Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.

""Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,"" Piskorski said. ""The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.""

Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.

""Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that's a good thing,"" Hale told CNN.

But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, ""will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.""

The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers' and sellers' agents. While previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.

Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.

Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.

Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.

""I really believe it's a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,"" he said.

Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase flights on their own.

""The buyers' agent will become, this is the part that's a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they're kind of pointing you in the right direction,"" he said. ""You know, 'this neighborhood has good schools,' all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you're hoping for that local expertise.""

A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill other duties of a buyers' agent, would ""significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.""

Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.

The real estate market, he said, is ""too complex to be completely automated on a computer.""

Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.

Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.

A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. ""Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,"" he said.

Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives.",cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,,0.0980392156862746,448978663,18,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/18/d62cc0ce-cd7a-4dcb-819d-0bf412915529/thumbnail/1200x630/a7c5c92151dd2be5491dbf5e9daf391f/6p-pkg-realtor-pay-laws-wcco4jix.jpg?v=4baa656f7af774a52a8c6a88476cb826,

The RBI is proposing new rules for dividend declarations based on NNPA ratios and total capital adequacy.New Delhi, Public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to pay a dividend in excess of Rs 15,000 crore for the financial year ending March 2024 on the back of improved profitability, according to sources. In the first three quarters of the current financial year, all 12 PSBs earned a total profit of Rs 98,000 crore, only Rs 7,000 crore less than the entire FY23.

PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

As a result, the government earned a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, 58 per cent higher than the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous financial year.

Since the profit in the current financial year would be much higher than the previous year, so will be the dividend payout to the government, sources said.

Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added.

Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends.

As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends.

The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards.

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The High Court accepts a petition submitted by the environmental advocacy organization Adam Teva V'Din charging that a search committee set up to recommend a director general for the fast-track Planning Administration did not have any representatives with the appropriate professional background in planning to properly assess candidates' skills.

Adam Teva V'Din's CEO Amit Bracha says his organization will continue to ""stand guard"" so that appointments that have significant implications for the environment meet the full requirements of the law.

Rafi Elmaliach, who worked for years at the Israel Land Authority, most recently as senior director of planning and projects, was chosen for the post and took office in August 2022 for five years.

Justice Isaac Amit rules that a new search committee should be established and that the appointment be reviewed within six months.

He does not relate to Adam Teva V'Din's assertion that Elmaliach faces a potential conflict of interest because of his long tenure at the ILA, with which the Planning Administration works closely.

Nor does he propose sacking Elmaliach, noting his ""extensive experience in the field.""

The symbolic ""lights off"" is back as part of the global Earth Hour campaign that seeks to engage people and create awareness about the Earth and the environment.

""Lights off"" was started by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), an international nongovernmental organization working in wilderness preservation and the environment, as a symbolic event to keep the lights off in Sydney in 2007, has turned into a major catalyst to promote the environmental protection movement.

More than ""410,000 hours were given"" to the planet last year by supporters in over 190 countries and territories, according to the campaign.

The annual campaign brought as many people as possible together, asking them to switch off at 8.30 p.m. local time and spend 60 minutes doing something positive for the planet as the world is now at a ""tipping point"" with climate and nature crises.

""WWF's Earth Hour is a moment of global unity that brings people from all over the world together, shines a spotlight on the climate and nature crisis and inspires people to act and advocate for urgent change,"" a spokesperson for the WWF U.K. told Anadolu Agency (AA).

Touching on the U.K., when it comes to nature, the spokesperson said nature and concerns about climate change and the environment are a top issue for the public in Britain.

As part of this year's campaign, many renowned landmarks supported Earth Hour by going dark and switching off lights, including the London Eye and the four Tate Museums in London, Liverpool and Cornwall.

Additionally, BFI IMAX, Piccadilly Lights, Westfield, Historical Royal Palaces and Buckingham Palace, also switched off all lights on those premises in support of the campaign.

In Istanbul, Salt Galata, a culture complex which is located in the old headquarters of the Ottoman Bank also switched its lights off.

""Small actions can make a big difference, so we can't wait to see how many people get involved this year and give an hour for Earth to help bring our world back to life,"" the spokesperson added in written comments.

On the importance of environmental campaigns, although global security challenges and conflicts are among the world's top agenda items, the WWF cited a report that revealed global wildlife population sizes have declined 69% on average since 1970, and Britain has become ""one of the most nature-depleted countries"" in the world.

""Never has it been more important to show our leaders we must tackle the nature and climate crisis with urgent action,"" according to the WWF statement that was sent in response to a question by Anadolu Agency (AA).

The campaign has a series of recommendations for those taking part in the campaign during the day, including going outside and ""make your outdoor space more nature friendly.""

For those who will be at work, it suggested screening the WWF's ""Save Our Wild Isles business films,"" while discussing how your workplace can be part of the solution.

Cooking a ""sustainable meal"" is a suggestion for participants who will also be asked to take the flagship step by switching off to be a ""part of a movement of millions of people around the world.""

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres defined Earth Hour as a ""global show of solidarity with our planet.""

""Let's turn off the lights and turn the world towards a brighter future for us all,"" he said.

Among them was the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin where the lights went off as part of a global movement that encourages nations to switch off their lights at 8:30 p.m. local time for an hour to bring attention to the issues of nature loss and climate change.

In Germany, alongside highlighting environmental issues, the event sought to comment on the political climate.

""The current zeitgeist is tense. Crises, conflicts and wars are keeping people very busy,"" said Viviane Raddatz, head of climate at WWF Germany, in the run-up to the event.

""This year, we want to use Earth Hour as a moment for each other, for our planet, and show that we are united: We stand up for more climate protection, for mutual respect, for democracy.""

She said this year's darkening of the monument was a way of taking a stand against a shift to the right and associated denial of climate catastrophes.

Other monuments worldwide from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Opera House and the Empire State Building in New York, the Colosseum in Rome, the Croatian State Archives building in Zagreb, the Burj Khalifa building in the United Arab Emirates and many other landmarks were taking part in Earth Hour.

This year's campaign began in New Zealand, with Auckland monuments including the Sky Tower and Harbour Bridge and Wellington's Parliament buildings going dark at 8:30 p.m.",thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,,0.2156862745098038,448978573,1,https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/320833.jpg,

The co-founder of Vernon's Climate Action Group is being recognized for her tireless work within the raise awareness around climate issues.

Dr. Mary Stockdale has been given the Leader of the Year award at the 2024 Community Leader Award banquet, hosted at the Vernon Lodge on Wednesday, March 13. The CLA's are a revived program started by the Vernon Morning Star, to recognize leaders in and around the community that have been working behind the scenes.

There were a number of submissions for 12 specific categories, which range from mentorship, coaching, volunteering and leadership.

Stockdale is a professor at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, in the department of community, culture and global studies. She teaches and does research in the area of sustainability, the environment and food systems, in the discipline of geography.

Stockdale, together with Bill Darnell, founded the Vernon Climate Action Group, which is now known as Climate Action Now.

""The group did a lot of advocating for action on climate change at the local, provincial and national level,"" said Terry Dyck, who nominated Stockdale. ""In 2016, she petitioned the city to develop a climate action plan and form a committee to oversee the process. She became co-chair of the committee and then, upon implementing, oversaw its development within the city.""

Stockdale was also a director for the Sustainable Environment Network Society and an early member of the North Okanagan Food Action Society where she helped to run the 100 Mile Diet (eat local) challenge.

Vernon's cycling advocacy has Stockdale to thank for a lot of its initiatives as well. She worked with community members and city planners to improve bike lanes, support Bike to Work Week and was a part of the Vernon Cycling Advisory Committee.

""Vernon has now become much more cycling friendly,"" said Dyck. ""It is now recognized as a great place for cycling and Mary had a big role in this.""

In a joint statement on Friday, the business groups said the provision in Senate Bill No. 2593 ""may inadvertently weaken the administration's goal of fostering competition among potential suppliers.""

""This limits the diversity of the pool of competitors from which the government can even select the best value-for-money option -- one that balances quality, performance, sustainability, and cost,"" the groups said.

Legislators are seeking to modernize procurement to rid the system of corruption and unwarranted delays.

The proposed New Government Procurement Act aims to streamline the procurement process from 120 days to 27 days.

It also seeks to give preference to bids that feature locally manufactured and environment-friendly goods, articles, and materials.

Citing the complexity of supply chains, business groups said it would be difficult to classify products or services as simply ""local"" or ""domestic.""

""If a Filipino supplier forms part of a foreign provider's supply chain but is not necessarily the dominant player in that relationship, the domestic preference rule works against the Filipino supplier in such a case,"" according to the groups.

They added that ""if the bid of a domestic bidder is higher than the lowest foreign bidder but within a 25% margin, the domestic bidder wins.""

The bill could also hamper the development of other industries, like defense and state-owned enterprises, which ""will be forced to purchase from Filipino-owned firms with higher prices.""

Preferential treatment would also limit the government's options for digitalization amid President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.'s earlier directive to digitalize vital services in government agencies.

""The administration's goal of whole-of-government digitalization means accessing innovative and secure solutions from technology-forward companies that can provide solutions at scale,"" the groups said.

The bill is still being debated in the Senate plenary. The House of Representatives passed its version of the measure on third and final reading last year.

House Senior Deputy Speaker and Pampanga Rep. Aurelio D. Gonzales, Jr. told reporters last week that the new procurement law will be passed in time for the President's State of the Nation Address in July.

The measure, which is also backed by the Budget department, is included in the Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council's (LEDAC) priority measures for approval this year.",bworldonline.com,news,BusinessWorld,,-0.1294117647058823,448978354,1,https://www.bworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dbm-filefoto.jpg,

Solar panels, LED lighting and wall insulation are some of the energy-saving measures that are set to be installed at Benfield School in Walkergate.

These eco-upgrades will improve the energy efficiency of the school, helping to lower its bills and reduce its carbon footprint. The project is being funded by a £4m grant that secured by Newcastle City Council and NEAT Academy Trust from the Government's Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme.

The scheme is run by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and is delivered by Salix Finance. The NEAT Academy Trust will also contribute additional funding towards the project, which will be delivered over the next 18 months.

Coun Marion Williams, the Newcastle City Council Cabinet member involved in the project, said: ""We have made a strong commitment to make public buildings across the city more sustainable so it is great we have secured this funding. The school is a really important asset in the community, with its sport facilities such as the swimming pool and sports hall being used by pupils during the day and by the public during evenings, weekends and school holidays.

""We look forward to seeing the project get under way as this is another important step towards our city achieving its net zero ambitions.""

Anthony Martin, head teacher at Benfield School, said: ""We have been delighted to work with Newcastle City Council to develop this major heat decarbonisation project for the school and are thrilled to have received the Government grant funding delivered through Salix to support its implementation. I am particularly excited around the opportunity that it provides to the pupils at Benfield School.

A permanent exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Utah is designed, according to one of its curators, to inspire optimism and action for a better future in the face of climate change.

""A Climate of Hope"" -- NHMU's first new permanent exhibition in 12 years -- is meant to be different from other such presentations focused on climate change, said exhibit developer Lisa Thompson.

""Typical museum exhibits about climate change were very data heavy, and they tended to be very gloomy ... and they tended to often focus on faraway places,"" Thompson said. ""And we know from the field of climate communication research that's been growing ... that those just aren't very effective ways to help people learn about climate change or to help them know how they can be part of climate solutions.""

The interactive exhibit shows how climate change impacts Utah, and how people around the state are implementing solutions. Visitors are shown volunteer opportunities in which they can take part to combat climate change at the local level.

Thompson said NHMU has been developing the exhibit, which opened in November, since 2019.

""[We did] interviews and surveys with visitors to understand what they know about climate change, what they feel about climate change and what they would like to see in the climate change exhibit,"" Thompson said. ""We did that just before the pandemic shut everything down.""

Jason Cryan, NHMU's executive director, said the exhibit is a part of the museum's larger climate initiative.

""The 'Climate of Hope' initiative also includes large-scale sustainability measures,"" he said. ""We're trying to see what it's going to take to make this a net-zero carbon neutral operation. We have several research programs that are kind of aimed at sustainability, biodiversity and those kinds of things, so all of this wraps up under a very big umbrella.""

Lynne Zummo, NHMU's curator of learning sciences, is conducting a four-year study to see how people respond to the exhibit's message framing.

(Natural History Museum of Utah) An interactive display is part of ""A Climate of Hope,"" a permanent exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Utah. Opened in November 2023, it's the first new permanent exhibit at NHMU in 12 years.

""The whole goal of the research is to understand the learning processes that people go through as they're experiencing the exhibit,"" Zummo said.

Participants in the study, Zummo said, will view the exhibit strapped with cameras and recorders.

""We'll look for themes and patterns across groups and really try to unpack what are the different influences that come into play in learning around climate change in the exhibit,"" Zummo said. ""Because it is a very different learning process than around other science issues.""

After seeing the exhibit, participants will complete a survey to learn how they cope with climate change, followed by an interview a few weeks later. The exhibition will adjust its messaging in response to the study's results.

""We're excited to see if it helps people feel a little more hopeful, feel like they can take meaningful action, and feel like Utah is a place where a lot of really cool things are happening,"" Thompson said. ""And then we're going to find out, which I think is a really unique part of this project, that what Lynne learns is going to help museums ... and people all over the country better develop theories and ways of teaching about climate change.""

The exhibition is open daily, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 9 p.m. on Wednesdays). It is free for University of Utah students, faculty and staff.

Public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to pay a dividend in excess of Rs 15,000 crore for the financial year ending March 2024 on the back of improved profitability, according to sources.In the first three quarters of the current financial year, all 12 PSBs earned a total profit of Rs 98,000 crore, only Rs 7,000 crore less than the entire FY23.PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

As a result, the government earned a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, 58 per cent higher than the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous financial year. Since the profit in the current financial year would be much higher than the previous year, so will be the dividend payout to the government, sources said.

Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added. Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends.As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends.

The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards.The draft lays down directions that need to be followed by banks' boards while considering proposals of dividend payouts, which include consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs as well.A commercial bank should have a minimum total capital adequacy of 11.5 per cent to be eligible for declaring dividends, the circular said.",financialexpress.com,news,The Financial Express,,0.2156862745098038,448978004,1,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rupee-image-2.jpg,eng-9414970

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

Nadur Nadif highlighted the fact that ""the photos speak for themselves... a quick lesson on why should we reduce the amount of plastic we are using. If we reduce the amount of plastic we use (throw away), the less of it will turn into microplastics. As time goes by, these plastics continue to deteriorate.""

The NGO stressed that unfortunately, these microplastics can enter the food chain and cause a lot of harm to the ecosystems. For example, small animals can suffer reduced growth, inflammatory responses as well as reduced feeding behavior.

NTM Gozo Section said that although the beach doesn't look littered, unfortunately the sand is full of microplastics - there are loads of man-made items less then 5mm in size. - mainly plastic items which result from broken down containers and other plastic items but also including nurdles, which are also referred to as mermaid's tears or pellets.

It added that, ""these are frequently being mistaken as food my wildlife and the rest is unfortunately part of humanity's story. These items have to be hand picked or sieved, though sieving will then involve removing organic material such as seaweed, plant branches and roots, shells, small stones, feathers, etc.""

""One can easily estimate that during yesterday's cleanup thousands of pieces were collected, pieces which would have remained in the environment and break down further,"" the NTM Gozo Section said.

They invited all beach-goers to ""dedicate some time, even 5 minutes, picking up these microplastics and disposing of them in the bins - Every little help counts.""

The responsibility has been prescribed in the 2020 Law on Environmental Protection, which is expected to contribute to enhancing the reuse, recycling, and reduction of waste, and changing the habits of both manufacturers and consumers, towards a circular economy.

Dr. Phan Tuan Hung, Director of the National Extended Producer Responsibility Council Office, called the EPR an economic tool that follows market principles, and a new policy approach to deal with waste problems.

The EPR also promotes the recycling industry and provides economic and employment opportunities, and helps the Government achieve its environmental goals, he continued.

If properly and fully implemented, the EPR would ensure the circulation of resources between the input and waste stages in the production process and help achieve the goal of no emissions, Hung explained.

""No matter what form of recycling a manufacturing enterprise chooses, cash will flow to businesses that collect and recycle waste,"" he said.

But only advanced and modern recycling technologies that meet environmental standards would benefit from the EPR policy, he stressed, adding that small recyclers who struggle to acquire advanced technologies should join hands.

This is the first year of EPR implementation in Vietnam, and the hope is to create a change in the process of promoting the circular economy.

Local manufacturers and importers have embraced EPR quite early.

In 2021, nine enterprises, including TH Group, Coca-Cola, Friesland Campina, La Vie, Nestle, Nutifood, Suntory PepsiCo, Tetra Pak, and Universal Robina Corporation established the Packaging Recycling Organisation Vietnam.

Its mission is to develop a strong packaging collection and recycling ecosystem that helps increase recycling rates and minimise the rate of packaging discharged into the environment.

It has helped raise consumer awareness about recycling and waste classification and strengthen the existing packaging collection ecosystem.

In addition to the organisation's efforts, its members have also actively responded and signed cooperation agreements with recyclers.

Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage and DUYTAN Plastic Recycling signed a strategic agreement for the supply of recycled plastic to the former to make packaging for its products in 2022-26.

In October 2023, La Vie Limited Liability Company signed a memorandum of understanding for a waste-plastic collection and recycling cooperation programme with DUYTAN Plastic Recycling.

Under the five-year programme, the two have a target of collecting and recycling 11,000 tonnes of plastic waste.

In November, Friesland Campina Vietnam signed an agreement with Dong Tien Binh Duong Paper Company Limited and Truong Thinh Mechanical Construction Company Limited to improve its waste-packaging collection and recycling capacity.

Many Vietnamese businesses are also seeking to invest in recycling plants.

DUYTAN Plastic Recycling has invested US$60 million in a plastic recycling plant that uses Bottle to Bottle technology. The technology allows plastic to be recycled up to 50 times.

The factory is now among the five most modern and largest that recycle plastic in the world. It has a capacity of 40,000 tonnes a year.

Vietcycle Corporation and ALBA Group have established a 48,000-tonne recycling plant at a cost of US$50 million. It uses technology from Germany to recycle and create rPET plastic that meets international standards. It is the first in the north to recycle and make food-grade plastic.

It's a journey of growth, learning, and connection with nature. Yet, what does it truly mean to be a successful gardener?

Is it about yielding the most luscious tomatoes, cultivating an enviable flower bed, or is it something deeper, more intrinsic? Let's delve into the essence of gardening success, exploring the key attributes that empower gardeners to thrive and create verdant sanctuaries.

At the heart of every successful gardener is the spirit of perseverance. Gardening is a testament to the power of resilience; it's about embracing the cycle of growth, decay, and rebirth. Every seasoned gardener understands failure is a stepping stone to knowledge and improvement.

Whether it's battling pests, grappling with adverse weather, or learning the nuances of soil health, the journey of a gardener is fraught with challenges. Yet, through these trials, we find our strength, learn to adapt, and ultimately flourish. Perseverance is about enduring and thriving amidst the unpredictable nature of gardening.

A thriving garden's essence lies in its physical beauty and the positivity it fosters. Success in gardening cannot be measured solely by tangible outcomes but by the joy and fulfillment it brings. A positive outlook enables gardeners to appreciate the fruits of their labor, to see the beauty in the blooms and the lessons in the losses. This sense of positivity transforms a simple garden into a sanctuary of peace and personal achievement.

Kindness is the soil in which the seeds of success are sown. It's about extending warmth and care to the plants and the wildlife that frequents our gardens and the surrounding community. A gardener's kindness is reflected in their approach to the ecosystem, fostering a space where life thrives in harmony. Kindness reminds us that our gardens are not isolated plots but integral parts of a larger, interconnected web of life.

Investedness in gardening transcends the mere allocation of time and resources; it's about immersing oneself in the rhythm of nature. Successful gardeners are those deeply committed to the well-being of their garden, recognizing that their investment goes beyond the physical. It's about the emotional and spiritual connection to the space we cultivate, understanding that the more we give, the more we receive in return.

The landscape of gardening is ever-changing, and so must be the mindset of the gardener. Open-mindedness is the key to unlocking the full potential of our gardens and ourselves. It's about being willing to experiment, to learn from nature, and to adapt our practices in response to new insights and changing conditions. The most vibrant gardens are those that reflect the creativity and adaptability of their caretakers.

Gardening reflects the gardener's journey -- a testament to the virtues of perseverance, positivity, kindness, investedness, and open-mindedness. These attributes are the nutrients that feed the soul of the gardener and the garden alike.

As we nurture these qualities within ourselves, we cultivate thriving gardens, a deeper connection to the earth, and a more fulfilling life. Let us embrace these attributes, sow the seeds of success, and watch as both we and our gardens blossom into their fullest potential.",shiftfrequency.com,news,Shift Frequency,,0.2941176470588236,448977856,1,https://shiftfrequency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FlowersGardenArborTree.jpg,

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

However, these charming flowers are not just about beauty; they are sensitive to their environment, particularly temperature. Understanding the temperature thresholds that can affect pansy health and bloom is crucial for gardeners. This article delves into the critical question: ""What temperature will kill pansies?"" By exploring the impact of both cold and hot extremes, we aim to provide valuable insights and practical tips for maintaining the vitality of these beloved flowers through the challenges of varying temperatures.

What Temperature Will Kill Pansies?

Pansies are resilient and can withstand cooler temperatures but are susceptible to extreme cold and heat. Generally, pansies can survive in temperatures as low as -6 °C (20°F) but may struggle and possibly perish when temperatures drop below 9°C (15°F), especially for prolonged periods. Conversely, high temperatures, particularly above 25°C (77°F), can also stress pansies, leading to wilting, reduced flowering, and potentially death if the heat persists without adequate care. Therefore, while pansies are pretty hardy, they thrive best in moderate temperatures and need protection from extreme cold and heat.

Temperature tolerance in pansies is a critical aspect of their care and survival. Pansies, known for their colorful and expressive blooms, are surprisingly hardy flowers that can withstand a wide range of temperatures but have their limits. Here's a closer look at their temperature tolerance:

Pansies flourish in cooler weather. They are ideally suited for spring and fall, with the optimal temperature range being between 4°C to 18°C (40°F to 65°F). This range promotes healthy growth and vibrant flowering.

One of the remarkable traits of pansies is their ability to withstand cold temperatures. They can typically survive light frosts and short periods of freezing conditions. Pansies often manage well in temperatures as low as -6 °C (20°F) and can even endure brief dips below this, around -9 °C (15°F), mainly if they are acclimated or protected.

Pansies can handle cool temperatures but struggle in hot conditions. Prolonged exposure to temperatures above 25°C (77°F) can be detrimental. High heat can lead to wilting, leaf burn, and a significant decrease in flower production. In extreme cases, sustained high temperatures can be fatal to pansies.

Pansies can generally handle temperature swings that are common in spring and fall. However, abrupt changes from cold to hot temperatures can stress the plants, mainly if they have not been gradually acclimated.

It's important to note that temperature tolerance can vary based on the specific variety of pansies and the region they are grown in. Gardeners should select varieties well-suited to their local climate and be mindful of microclimates within their gardens. Specific measures can be taken when temperatures stray from the ideal range. Mulching can help insulate pansies against cold while shading and adequate watering can protect them from heat stress.

Low temperatures can significantly impact pansies, affecting their growth, health, and blooming patterns. While pansies are known for their cold hardiness, extreme cold conditions and exceedingly prolonged exposure can lead to several issues:

Pansies can survive light frosts and cool temperatures, so they are often planted in early spring and late fall. However, when temperatures fall below -6°C (20°F) and approach -9°C (15°F), they start to experience stress. Prolonged exposure to such low temperatures, particularly without snow cover or mulch for insulation, can damage or even kill the plants.

Signs of cold damage in pansies include wilting, discoloration, and a water-soaked appearance. The leaves and petals may turn dark and lose their firmness, indicating frostbite. In severe cases, the plant's cells can burst due to the expansion of frozen water inside, leading to irreversible damage.

Cold stress can slow the growth of pansies and significantly reduce their flowering. The plants may enter a dormant state to conserve energy, resulting in fewer or no blooms. If the cold exposure is prolonged, the plants might not recover well even when temperatures rise.

The root system of pansies is particularly vulnerable to cold. If the soil freezes, it can damage the roots, impeding the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. This can weaken the pansies, making them more susceptible to other stresses and diseases.

After experiencing extreme cold, pansies may have stunted growth or delayed blooming in the following season. The recovery of pansies depends on the duration and intensity of the cold exposure and the overall health of the plants before the cold spell.

To protect pansies from low temperatures, gardeners can use mulching to insulate the soil, cover the plants with frost cloths during cold nights, and choose planting locations less exposed to harsh winter winds.

High temperatures and heat can noticeably impact pansies, which are generally more comfortable in cooler weather. Here are the effects of high temperatures on pansies:

Wilting And Stress: Pansies are cool-season plants that are not well-suited to hot weather. When exposed to high temperatures, significantly above 25°C (77°F), pansies often start to wilt. Their leaves and stems lose turgidity, and the plants appear stressed.

Reduced Flowering: Pansies are valued for their colorful and abundant blooms, but heat stress can reduce flower production. High temperatures can discourage the formation of new flower buds, leading to fewer flowers and a less vibrant display.

Leaf Burn: Pansy leaves are susceptible to sunburn and scorching in hot weather. The edges of the leaves may turn brown or become crispy. This affects the plant's appearance and can hinder its ability to photosynthesize and produce energy.

Shortened Blooming Period: Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can shorten the overall blooming period of pansies. Instead of thriving throughout the cooler months, they may cease flowering prematurely, leaving gardeners with fewer blooms than expected.

Heat Stress Diseases: Hot and humid conditions can create an environment conducive to fungal and bacterial diseases in pansies. These diseases, such as leaf spot and powdery mildew, can further weaken the plants and affect their appearance.

Water Requirements: Pansies need adequate moisture to cope with heat stress. High temperatures can cause the soil to dry out quickly, leading to water stress for the plants. Regular watering is essential during hot weather to keep pansies hydrated.

Shading And Cooling Measures: To protect pansies from high temperatures, gardeners can use shade cloths or provide temporary shade with larger plants. Also, mulching can help maintain soil moisture and cool the root zone.

Planting Timing: Gardeners often plant pansies in late summer or early fall to take advantage of cooler temperatures in regions with hot summers. This allows pansies to establish themselves before the heat of summer arrives.

Seasonal care for pansies is essential to ensure these delightful flowers thrive year-round. Pansies are known for their versatility and adaptability to various seasons.

PSBs earned the highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FY23 compared to Rs 66,539.98 crore earned in 2021-22.

As a result, the government earned a dividend of Rs 13,804 crore, 58 per cent higher than the Rs 8,718 crore paid out in the previous financial year.

Since the profit in the current financial year would be much higher than the previous year, so will be the dividend payout to the government, sources said.

Going by the past record, the dividend payout for FY24 should be in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, they added.

Earlier in January, the Reserve Bank, in its draft guidelines, proposed to allow banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends.

As per the prevailing norms last updated in 2005, banks need to have an NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends.

The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards.

The draft lays down directions that need to be followed by banks' boards while considering proposals of dividend payouts, which include consideration on divergence in classification and provisioning for NPAs as well.

A commercial bank should have a minimum total capital adequacy of 11.5 per cent to be eligible for declaring dividends, the circular said.

Buried in the recesses of a 2018 report by the Office of Public Works (OPW) is an eye-catching assessment of the risk posed to Dublin from an extreme flooding event. For Ireland, climate change-induced weather events are more likely to manifest as flooding.

The OPW's ""Flood Risk Management Plan for the Liffey and Dublin Bay River Basin"" sets out the at-risk areas in Dublin, which include coastal areas such as Howth, Sutton, Clontarf and parts of Dublin City (including Ringsend) but also inland areas at risk of pluvial or river flooding such as Blessington, Baldonnel, Clane and Leixlip.

The estimated costs associated with various future flooding scenarios (in the absence of mitigation measures) are also laid out. Flooding damage (without an extreme weather scenario) currently costs city authorities (or did back then) €25 million a year.

However, in what the report classifies as a ""mid-range future scenario"" flooding event, a one-in-ten year event, which entails a 20 per cent increase in rainfall and 0.5 metre increase in sea level, the cost jumps to €333 million with up to 2,800 residential properties impacted.

In a high-end risk scenario, in other words a one-in-100 year event, involving a 30 per cent increase in rainfall and a one metre sea level rise, the cost jumps to €2.9 billion and involves 15,500 homes and almost 3,000 business premises being damaged.

But here's the sting. While a one-in-100 year event doesn't seem like something to get too worked up about, these types of events are expected to occur more frequently as global temperatures rise. According to experts, they could happen every year by 2100 due to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes as ""continuing deep ocean warming"".

IFAC estimates that Government tax revenues could fall by as much as €2.5 billion a year by 2030 as a result of lower taxes from fuel and energy use amid the switch to renewables and EVs.

""Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100,"" it said in a report last year.

And remember the OPW's risk assessment analysis is for Dublin only. Experts say parts of Cork and Limerick and other areas are more at risk and could potentially suffer more damage with big costs for the exchequer.

[ Ireland has a chance to influence the world's response to the climate emergency ]

Emeritus Professor of Geography at Maynooth University John Sweeney, one of Ireland's foremost climate scientists, has warned that Ireland has been lucky ""so far in that we've had storm surges when the tide has been out or we haven't had a depression arriving at the same time as the storm surge"".

He warns that there will come a time ""when the dice will fall badly and we will get that kind of joint probability going the wrong way and that's when we get the big problems"".

Sweeney cites the floods in Midleton, Co Cork last October as an example.

Extreme weather events - wildfires, droughts, heat waves, cold snaps - triggered by rising global temperatures are now part of the annual calendar.

""The fact that the tide was out enabled a large part of the town to dodge a bullet. But the situation is still that with higher sea levels the probability of a higher storm surge is on an increasing trend, as is the probability of more severe (though not necessarily more frequent) storms arriving,"" he says.

The heavy rainfall which caused the flooding in Midleton and other parts of east Cork is more than twice as likely to occur at current global temperatures in comparison with pre-industrial times.

Extreme weather events - wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, cold snaps - triggered by rising global temperatures are now part of the annual calendar.

Every major global climate record was broken last year and 2024 promises to be worse the World Meteorological Organisation warned last week, while highlighting rising sea temperatures and shrinking sea ice as particular concerns.

[ Climate change: 'How can we feed the world while not damaging it?' ]

The United Nations (UN) weather agency said in its annual State of the Global Climate report that average temperatures hit the highest level in 174 years of record-keeping by a clear margin, reaching 1.45 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

The EU's climate change monitoring service Copernicus indicated earlier this month that the global average temperature for the past 12 months - between March 2023 and February 2024 - was the highest on record at 1.56 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

That puts the world - perhaps temporarily but nonetheless worryingly - above the 1.5 degrees tipping point that scientists warn will usher in more extreme and unpredictable climate events.

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) has been utilising the OPW flood risk findings in its own work to estimate and warn about the likely fiscal impact of climate change here.

The watchdog estimates that Government tax revenues could fall by as much as €2.5 billion a year by 2030 as a result of lower taxes from fuel and energy use amid the switch to renewables and EVs while grants for retrofitting, assisting agricultural transition and other supports could lead to additional Government spending of between €1.6 billion and €3 billion a year from 2026 to 2030.

These fiscal challenges don't include the estimated expenditure needed for building and reinforcing flood defences. Without the latter we run the risk of incurring billions each year in flood damages, up to €1.15 billion per year by 2050, according one estimate by the Department of the Environment.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,-0.1686274509803921,448977714,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/e2IXJ8u8yqYd1pYYT1Qw1aBjQCc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/KXH6YE4Z3XKQP7IPKNCJQS2AMU.jpg,

The theme revolution.'

Dune, widely considered one of the best sci-fi novels of all time, continues to influence how writers, artists and inventors envision the future. Of course, there are Denis Villeneuve's visually stunning films, Dune: Part One (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024).

But Frank Herbert's masterpiece also helped Afrofuturist novelist Octavia Butler imagine a future of conflict amid environmental catastrophe; it inspired Elon Musk to build SpaceX and Tesla and push humanity toward the stars and a greener future; and it's hard not to see parallels in George Lucas's Star Wars franchise, especially their fascination with desert planets and giant worms.

And yet when Herbert sat down in 1963 to start writing Dune, he wasn't thinking about how to leave Earth behind. He was thinking about how to save it. Herbert wanted to tell a story about the environmental crisis on our own planet, a world driven to the edge of ecological catastrophe. Technologies that had been inconceivable just 50 years prior had put the world at the edge of nuclear war and the environment on the brink of collapse; massive industries were sucking wealth from the ground and spewing toxic fumes into the sky.

When the book was published, these themes were front and centre for readers, too. After all, they were living in the wake of both the Cuban missile crisis and the publication of ""Silent Spring,"" conservationist Rachel Carson's landmark study of pollution and its threat to the environment and human health. Dune soon became a beacon for the fledgling environmental movement and a rallying flag for the new science of ecology.

Though the term ""ecology"" had been coined almost a century earlier, the first textbook on ecology was not written until 1953, and the field was rarely mentioned in newspapers or magazines at the time. Few readers had heard of the emerging science, and even fewer knew what it suggested about the future of our planet.

While studying Dune for a book I'm writing on the history of ecology, I was surprised to learn that Herbert didn't learn about ecology as a student or as a journalist. Instead, he was inspired to explore ecology by the conservation practices of the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. He learned about them from two friends in particular. The first was Wilbur Ternyik, a descendant of Chief Coboway, the Clatsop leader who welcomed explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark when their expedition reached the West Coast in 1805. The second, Howard Hansen, was an art teacher and oral historian of the Quileute tribe.

Ternyik, who was also an expert field ecologist, took Herbert on a tour of Oregon's dunes in 1958. There, he explained his work to build massive dunes of sand using beach grasses and other deep-rooted plants in order to prevent the sands from blowing into the nearby town of Florence - a terraforming technology described at length in Dune.

As Ternyik explains in a handbook he wrote for the US Department of Agriculture, his work in Oregon was part of an effort to heal landscapes scarred by European colonization, especially the large river jetties built by early settlers. These structures disturbed coastal currents and created vast expanses of sand, turning stretches of the lush Pacific Northwest landscape into desert. This scenario is echoed in Dune where the novel's setting, the planet Arrakis, was similarly laid to waste by its first colonisers.

Hansen, who became the godfather to Herbert's son, had closely studied the equally drastic impact logging had on the homelands of the Quileute people in coastal Washington. He encouraged Herbert to examine ecology carefully, giving him a copy of Paul B Sears's Where There is Life, from which Herbert gathered one of his favourite quotes: ""The highest function of science is to give us an understanding of consequences."" The Fremen of Dune, who live in the deserts of Arrakis and carefully manage its ecosystem and wildlife, embody these teachings. In the fight to save their world, they expertly blend ecological science and Indigenous practices.

But the work that had the most profound impact on Dune was Leslie Reid's 1962 ecological study The Sociology of Nature. In it, Reid explained ecology and ecosystem science for a popular audience, illustrating the complex interdependence of all creatures within the environment. ""The more deeply ecology is studied,"" Reid writes, ""the clearer does it become that mutual dependence is a governing principle, that animals are bound to one another by unbreakable ties of dependence.""

In the pages of Reid's book, Herbert found a model for the ecosystem of Arrakis in a surprising place: the guano islands of Peru. As Reid explains, the accumulated bird droppings found on these islands was an ideal fertilizer. Home to mountains of manure described as a new ""white gold"" and one of the most valuable substances on Earth, the Guano islands became in the late 1800s ground zero for a series of resource wars between Spain and several of its former colonies, including Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador.

At the heart of the plot of Dune is a battle for control of the ""spice,"" a priceless resource. Harvested from the sands of the desert planet, it's both a luxurious flavouring for food and a hallucinogenic drug that allows some people to bend space, making interstellar travel possible. There is some irony in the fact that Herbert cooked up the idea of spice from bird droppings. But he was fascinated by Reid's careful account of the unique and efficient ecosystem that produced a valuable - albeit noxious - commodity.

As the ecologist explains, frigid currents in the Pacific Ocean push nutrients to the surface of nearby waters, helping photosynthetic plankton thrive. These support an astounding population of fish that feed hordes of birds, along with whales. In early drafts of Dune, Herbert combined all of these stages into the life cycle of the giant sandworms, football field-sized monsters that prowl the desert sands and devour everything in their path. Herbert imagines each of these terrifying creatures beginning as small, photosynthetic plants that grow into larger ""sand trout."" Eventually, they become immense sandworms that churn the desert sands, spewing spice onto the surface.

In both the book and Dune: Part One, soldier Gurney Halleck recites a cryptic verse that comments on this inversion of marine life and arid regimes of extraction: ""For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.""

After Dune was published in 1965, the environmental movement eagerly embraced it.

Herbert spoke at Philadelphia's first Earth Day in 1970, and in the first edition of the Whole Earth Catalog - a famous DIY manual and bulletin for environmental activists - Dune was advertised with the tagline: ""The metaphor is ecology. The theme revolution."" In the opening of Denis Villeneuve's first adaptation, Dune, Chani, an indigenous Fremen played by Zendaya, asks a question that anticipates the violent conclusion of the second film: ""Who will our next oppressors be?""

The immediate cut to a sleeping Paul Atreides, the white protagonist who's played by Timothée Chalamet, drives the pointed anti-colonial message home like a knife. In fact, both of Villeneuve's movies expertly elaborate upon the anti-colonial themes of Herbert's novels.

Unfortunately, the edge of their environmental critique is blunted. But Villeneuve has suggested that he might also adapt ""Dune Messiah"" for his next film in the series - a novel in which the ecological damage to Arrakis is glaringly obvious.

I hope Herbert's prescient ecological warning, which resonated so powerfully with readers back in the 1960s, will be unsheathed in Dune 3.",scroll.in,news,Scroll.in,,0.03529411764705892,448977714,1,https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/199421-tvenwvidaz-1710928867.jpg,

If construction cranes are looming over your local airport or ""Please Pardon Our Appearance"" signs are decking out the terminal, it may be partly thanks to Congress and the White House.

U.S. airports say money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a drop in the bucket when it comes to their funding sources and infrastructure needs. But the legislation is already helping some rip up worn carpets, upgrade restrooms and replace clunky baggage systems.

While federal dollars have long backed ""airside"" projects like runways and taxiways, the new infusion for terminal upgrades ""is a game changer,"" said Greg Cota, senior vice president of government and political affairs at the Airports Council International -- North America, an industry advocacy group.

As President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail to tout his infrastructure investments, airports are some of the most visible places to see them at work, whether or not voters reward him for it in November.

Appleton International Airport, in the battleground state of Wisconsin, received $3.43 million from the package. The funds will augment a much larger $66 million concourse expansion, which was planned before the pandemic and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025. Appleton, about 40 minutes southwest of Green Bay, is one of many airports that broke passenger records last year, and it expects to serve 1 million travelers this year.

Financing is coming ""from about eight different sources,"" said airport Director Abe Weber, including local, state and federal money, bonds and the airport's own cash. The grant awarded by the Biden administration will help pay for boarding bridges, a sustainability program that includes a microgrid and accessibility improvements such as ""hearing loops"" -- assistive technology for people with hearing loss.

Without those funds, Weber said, ""we probably wouldn't have been able to proceed with those pieces of the project.""

Last month, the White House announced infrastructure law grants totaling $970 million for upgrades at 114 airports intended to ""improve passenger experience, accessibility, and sustainability."" The discretionary awards are on top of nearly $2 billion in similar awards made over the past two years under the law's Airport Terminal Program, a $5 billion fund for competitive grants to support terminal upgrades.

Recent grants include $35 million to help Washington Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia construct a 14-gate terminal and transit connections to the Aerotrain and Metrorail. Another grant supplies $26 million to replace Denver International Airport's baggage handling system.

The terminal funding is just one slice of the measure's five-year, $25 billion pot for modernizing airports nationwide. Within that pool, a separate $5 billion is set aside for improvements to facilities and equipment owned by the Federal Aviation Administration, and $15 billion more is being distributed to airports through a formula based on passenger numbers.

Airports say they need much more.

""There's a lot of money out there, and Congress has been generous,"" said Kevin Burke, president and CEO of the North American airports council, who added that the government's prioritizing the passenger experience is novel. ""But it's not enough to be able to solve the long-term problem,"" he said, ""which is enough infrastructure money to be able to modernize all of our airports.""

In a report last year, the group called for $151 billion to fund ""critical"" infrastructure improvements over the next five years. Airports typically pay for upgrades with a mélange of rent from airlines and terminal vendors, landing charges tacked on to fliers' tickets, parking fees and money from various levels of government, as well loans and debt, often in the form of municipal bonds issued by airport authorities.

The new federal infrastructure funds could have an impact broader than the individual projects it's supporting, some experts said.

Because airports operate in tandem with one another, improvements at small and midsize ones can help large hubs, too, said Bill Wyatt, executive director of Salt Lake City International Airport. The Utah airport received $20 million in infrastructure law funds toward its $618.7 million building and airfield work tied to the further expansion of a just-built terminal.

While ""it's great whenever you can find some additional resources,"" Wyatt said, a boost to one airport's operations can be felt across the network, ""because suddenly one location now has added capacity, meaning we may get an extra flight that couldn't have happened except for the investment of this money.""

The funding influx may have its biggest impact at smaller airports, where ""these grants do play an important role in moving capital programs further and faster,"" said Earl Heffintrayer, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service.

South Carolina's Myrtle Beach International Airport, which serves more than 3 million passengers a year, received $10 million in Airport Terminal Program funds for an $80 million to $90 million expansion that was put on hold during the pandemic but is moving forward now. The 18-month project, which begins in June, will add six gates to the current 12 and revamp restrooms, flooring and signage in the existing terminal.

As at other airports, the Myrtle Beach construction is being financed by various sources, including ""cost recovery through billing back portions of the project to airlines operating at MYR over the life of the expanded facility,"" spokesman Ryan Betcher said. The $10 million grant will allow the airport to reduce the costs it passes on to airlines, help it retain existing flight routes and attract new ones, he said.

Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dollars are also helping some airports keep their projects on track despite higher costs from inflation.

Philadelphia International Airport is in the midst of a $1.8 billion capital program that includes upgrades to roadways, terminals and the airfield. It secured $74.4 million from the infrastructure package for initiatives that fit the ""shovel ready"" requirements for funding, Chief Development Officer Api Appulingam said.

""It's not that we wouldn't have somehow found the funds to do the project,"" she said, ""but the grants help with the uncertainty in the bidding environment."" Now, if bids come in higher than anticipated, ""we're able to cover the cost, versus trying to find that funding elsewhere"" and risk falling behind schedule, Appulingam said.",nbcnews.com,news,NBC News,,-0.07450980392156858,448977708,1,"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240319-philadelphia-international-airport-ew-702p-05c6ca.jpg",eng-9412840

""Climate change impacts everything we care about,"" she said. ""It's not just an environmental issue.""

That's why Harper, along with 30 or so colleagues from disciplines as wide-ranging as economics and epidemiology, have banded together into what she calls Canada's first university hub to shift the view of climate change from an environmental problem to a threat to human health.

""The hub is about helping people see that every climate change decision is a health decision,"" said Harper, a professor in the School of Public Health and a vice-chair on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading scientific body on the issue.

""Every climate change research project has health implications.""

Take bike lanes, for example.

City planners look at them as a way to decrease tailpipe emissions from cars. But riding a bike also improves health.

""There's a lot of power in framing climate change as a health issue,"" Harper said. ""There's research showing that if you frame (it) as a health problem, it inspires more action than if you frame it as an environment problem or economic issue.""

Canada is warming at twice the pace of the global average and abundant research already demonstrates that increasing temperatures are increasing health problems.

A 2022 report from the Public Health Agency of Canada called climate change ""the single biggest health threat facing humanity and the livability of the planet.""

Wildfire smoke, which last summer gave Canada some of the worst air quality on the globe, damages lung function, especially in children. Illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile are spreading as the parasites that carry them take advantage of new habitats. Diarrhea is becoming more common as warming waters host more bacteria.

There are mental health impacts as well, from the acute stress suffered by those forced to flee by flames to the pervasive sense of loss and grief as people mourn a familiar environment that has changed into something else. Often, the physical and mental effects occur at the same time, compounding each other.

And Harper's own experience after last year's wildfires will sound familiar to many.

""I have two young kids. We were stuck inside all summer. That was really hard.""

The threats are international.

The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.

The Climate Change and Health Hub will be officially announced on Tuesday at an event featuring Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa Tam. For now, it will be mostly a network of scientists, First Nations knowledge keepers and students who agree that such interdisciplinary work is needed and who plan to share ideas and research.

Such hubs already exist in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, Harper said.

She said Alberta's hub will be more than just a talk-shop for boffins. It will also take on public outreach and advocacy.

""We think in this era of mis- and disinformation that having a place that can mobilize evidence-informed advocacy is really important. It's providing evidence so that politicians can make decisions based on that evidence.""

The hub will plug a big gap in Canada's climate change research community, Harper says.

""Research on the topic is happening but it's not connected and researchers are not connected with each other. Climate change is by definition a very interdisciplinary topic.""

A Cùra Guardian roadshow event will take place at The Macphail Centre in Ullapool on Monday (March 25) at 2pm.

Cùra Guardian was launched last year by UK-based non-profit arts, cultural and educational organisation Heartstone, formed following the publication of its children's book The Heartstone Odyssey from which it takes its name.

Heartstone aims through dance-drama events, performances and installations to challenge racism, xenophobia and prejudice, raise environmental consciousness and promote the need to work cooperatively to achieve real change.

The organisation has received funding and support from NatureScot and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Scotland to create the Cùra Guardian website and roadshow. Cùra is a character from The Hearstone Odyssey and the name in Gaelic means ""protector"" or ""guardian"".

The event at Ullapool will be opened by Councillor Isabelle Campbell, a local ward representative.

Sitakumari, director and principal dancer/storyteller for Heartstone, will introduce the Cùra Guardian website at www.curaguardian.com, followed by an online presentation from Arvind Paranjpye, the director of the Nehru Planetarium, a keen supporter of Cùra Guardian, currently assisting with bringing new partners from across India to the environmental initiative. He will join from Mumbai.

The welcome will include an address by the Highland Indian Association, Highland Multicultural Association and Edinburgh's Women's Interfaith Group, alongside Heartstone.

In the second half of the event, Sitakumari and will be joined by young Ullapool dancers in supporting roles to present a dance-drama drawn from one of the stories on Cùra Guardian, 'In the Beat of a Dragonfly's Heart' .This story can be accessed from the link below: https://curaguardian.exposure.co/in-the-beat-of-a-dragonflys-heart

The Southern Hawker Dragonfly is important as a climate change marker. It is now being seen regularly in the Highlands, previously only recorded much further south, demonstrating the climate really is changing as evidenced by the presence of new species such as this.

An exhibition of some of the breathtaking images on Cùra Guardian, including those of the Southern Hawker, which inspired the choreography for the dance-drama, is on display at the centre.

Heartstone has acknowledged funding and support from NatureScot and The Pebble Trust for the website development and staging of this event. Sitakumari said: ""We are also grateful for the support of High Life Highland and Ullapool High School for their support, including locating the Ullapool dancers and local volunteers who have made this event possible.""",northern-times.co.uk,news,Northern Times,,0.2,448977642,1,https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/TNXFKCW75KLDBDNKDUXQ.jpg,

Ecosystem productivity is mainly determined by the rates of primary production (GPP) in turn controlled by nutrients, light availability and temperature, while temperature alone affect vital rates like consumption and metabolic rates and maintenance requirements of consumers. Increased level of TDOM causes brownification of water which may cause light limitation in algae and decrease GPP and especially so in the benthic habitat. Temperature increase has a been suggested to increase metabolic rates of consumers to larger extent than the corresponding effect on GPP, which suggest reduced top consumer biomass and production with warming.The aim of this thesis was to experimentally study the effects of increased temperature and TDOM on habitat specific and whole ecosystem GPP and fish densities and production. In a replicated large-scale pond experiment encompassing natural food webs of lotic ecosystems I studied population level responses to warming and brownification in the three- spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).Results showed overall that warming had no effect on whole ecosystem GPP, likely due to nutrient limitation, while TDOM input decreased benthic GPP but stimulated pelagic GPP. In fish, results first of all suggested that recruitment in sticklebacks over summer was negatively affected by warming as maintenance requirements in relation to GPP increased and thereby increased starvation mortality of young-of-the-year (YOY) sticklebacks. Secondly, brownification increased mortality over winter in YOY as the negative effect on light conditions likely decreased search efficiency and caused lower consumption rates and starvation over winter in sticklebacks. Third, seasonal production of YOY, older, and total stickleback production was negatively affected by warming, while increased TDOM caused decreased YOY and total fish production. The combined effect of the two was intermediate but still negative. Temperature effects on fish production were likely a result of increased energy requirements of fish in relation to resource production and intake rates whereas the negative effect of TDOM likely was a result of decreased benthic resource production. Finally, effects of warming over a three-year period caused total fish density and biomass and abundance of both mature and old fish to decrease, while proportion of young fish increased. The main cause behind the strong negative effects of warming on fish population biomass and changes in population demographic parameters were likely the temperature driven increased energy requirements relative to resource production and cohort competition.The results from this thesis suggest that predicted climate change impacts on lentic aquatic ecosystems will decrease future densities and biomass of fish and negatively affect fish production and especially so in systems dominated by benthic resource production.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.4588235294117646,448977303,1,,

Representatives from both sides shared their achievements, plans and challenges in such crucial areas of circular economy and methane emission reduction. This included insights into waste management and methane response, highlighting the innovative strategies and practices being implemented to address these pressing issues.

The focus on green transportation and new energy vehicles was also discussed, with representatives from both sides exchanging information on their accomplishments, future plans, and the hurdles they face in decarbonizing transportation. The deployment of new energy vehicles, the development of charging infrastructure, and the advancement of electric vehicle access technologies were among the key areas of discussion, showcasing the commitment of both regions to sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions.

The representatives from California emphasized the wealth of experience and practices that both California and Hainan have to offer each other. ""In many ways, California leads in climate, and we're here because Hainan does as well,"" said California Secretary of Environmental Protection Yana Garcia-Gonzalez.

""Some of the areas of collaboration between Hainan and California include reaching our carbon neutrality targets, which are critical to reducing carbon pollution and also protecting people from the impacts of air pollution and air quality ... And we're also working on things like climate adaptation and nature-based solutions to make sure that we're protecting our water supply and protecting our water, enhancing biodiversity and protecting our species as we're getting toward achieving carbon neutrality,"" she added.

The ongoing cooperation in the field of climate change and green and low-carbon development showcases a commitment to leveraging each other's expertise for the greater good. The exchange of valuable experiences in methane emission reduction, carbon emission trading markets, and ecological restoration during the dialogue underscores the benefits of such collaboration.

Hainan's representatives said that the commitment to continuing regular communication with California and deepening cooperation in carbon reduction, pollution reduction, and air quality maintenance reflects a strong dedication to sustained collaboration and progress.

Both sides also discussed the ""2024 Work Plan (Draft) of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation between Hainan and California"" at the dialogue. It noted that this year, Hainan and California will center around six key priorities for further cooperation, including a seminar on new energy vehicles (NEV) and transportation decarbonization technology, a seminar on freight power replacement technology, and policy exchanges on building and electrical energy conservation, including carbon-embedded materials.

Echo Global Logistics grows cross-border footprint as trade booms

Echo Global Logistics has opened new locations in Texas and Mexico, as more global companies are moving production south of the border to seek a manufacturing hub closer to the United States.

Officials for the Chicago-based company said they have been managing shipping solutions along the U.S.-Mexico border for the past eight years, but the recent expansion puts boots on the ground for the first time in Mexico, with locations in Mexico City and Monterrey.

The company also opened a location in Laredo, Texas, and recently named veteran logistics industry executive Troy Ryley as president of Echo Mexico. Ryley said Echo already handles thousands of monthly shipments to and from Mexico and the number will grow with the expansion.

""Echo is obviously a very dynamic company. We work with over 50,000 transport providers, through about 35,000 clients,"" Ryley told FreightWaves. ""These clients have continued to work with us at the Southern border. For the last decade, Echo has actually had cross-border Mexico shipments that the company has handled, but they've handled it from a base in Chicago. Echo has made the decision to increase their investment and put boots on the ground in Mexico, so we can further provide enhanced service for our clients.""

Founded in 2005, Echo Global Logistics is a global provider of supply chain management services.

With the new locations in Laredo, Monterrey and Mexico City, Echo now has 29 operations across the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to Laredo, Echo has Texas operations in Houston and Dallas.

Echo's strategy follows similar recent moves or expansions in Texas or Mexico by other transportation providers and freight brokers, such as Redwood Logistics, C.H. Robinson, Ryder System Inc., Arrive Logistics and BlueGrace Logistics.

Over the past several years, Mexico has emerged as one of the key players in the global supply chain. In 2023, Mexico surpassed Canada and China as the top U.S. trading partner for the year, totaling $798 billion in trade.

Mexico was also the top U.S. trading partner for the month of January, with two-way commerce totaling $64.5 billion.

The port of entry in Laredo, Texas, was the No. 2-ranked U.S. trade gateway during January. Trade at the Laredo port of entry totaled $25 billion for the month.

Ryley said having a presence in Mexico will allow Echo to simplify brokerage services on both sides of the border, along with helping shippers and carriers navigate customs and border crossings.

""We're going to continue to work on the same product we deliver and handle today,"" Ryley said.

""We offer freight brokerage, managed transportation, as well as a bunch of other modes, such as truckload, less-than-truckload, intermodal and expedited shipments all over the Southern border. In the future, we will incorporate those services also into cross-border. We just don't have an exact timeline yet. Some of the service that is managed transportation, we actually do handle for clients cross-border in and out of Mexico, but not intra-Mexico. That's another product we're also looking at, based on client demand, is an intra-Mexico solution.""

Renardo Green's 2024 NFL Draft projection

Even though we may not have a blue-chip corner prospect in this class, there are a lot of big-ticket recruits, guys from major programs and/or have substantial ball production to their name. That's why players like Renardo Green can kind of get lost in the shuffle.

To go with just one career pick, he has fairly average size and athletic testing numbers. However, just looking at the description of ""don't let the guy across from you get open and knock the ball down when it gets there"", there aren't many corners who had a better 2023 season than Green. He then followed that up by absolutely blanketing a pretty talented crop of Shrine Bowl receivers.

Once again, I look at Renardo Green as a better fit in a defense that uses single-high safety coverage more extensively, but it's more so based on being less proven playing off and how good he already is at sticking to guys at the line.

What I loved about his film was that he didn't just clearly study his opponents extensively and was taking charge of reps early on, but as they did find some success against him, he made adjustments in-game that tilted the scales back in his favor.",sportskeeda.com,news,Sportskeeda,,-0.08235294117647063,448977038,1,https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/03/9aae8-17112351970410-1920.jpg,

Recent reports of escalating malnutrition rates serve as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. In this context, investing in climate-smart agriculture emerges as a promising strategy to not only enhance food security but also mitigate the root causes of malnutrition.

Bunyoro, like many other regions in sub-Saharan Africa, is facing a multifaceted challenge exacerbated by climate variability and environmental degradation.

Erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, and soil degradation pose significant threats to agricultural productivity, disrupting food systems and exacerbating malnutrition.

The consequences are dire, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women, who bear the brunt of nutritional deficiencies.

However, amidst these challenges lie opportunities for transformative change. Climate-smart agriculture offers a holistic approach that integrates sustainable land management, climate adaptation, and nutrition-sensitive practices to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience.

By harnessing nature-based solutions and indigenous knowledge, farmers in Bunyoro can mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change while simultaneously improving food security and nutrition outcomes.

One of the key pillars of climate-smart agriculture is agroforestry, which involves the strategic integration of trees and crops on farms.

Trees provide multiple benefits, including soil conservation, water retention, and biodiversity conservation, while also enhancing crop yields and nutritional diversity.

Incorporating climate-resilient crop varieties and sustainable water management techniques further strengthens the resilience of agricultural systems, enabling farmers to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Moreover, climate-smart agriculture emphasises the importance of diversifying food production to ensure dietary diversity and nutritional adequacy.

By promoting the cultivation of nutrient-rich crops such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes, farmers can enhance the nutritional quality of their diets and reduce dependence on staple crops that are vulnerable to climate shocks. Integrated livestock and fish farming systems also contribute to food security by providing additional sources of protein and essential nutrients.

Furthermore, investing in climate-smart agriculture offers a pathway towards sustainable development and poverty reduction in Bunyoro. By enhancing agricultural productivity and income opportunities for smallholder farmers, it creates resilient livelihoods that withstand the impacts of climate change.

Empowering women and youth with access to resources, training, and market linkages is critical for fostering inclusive and equitable growth, ensuring that the benefits of agricultural transformation reach those most in need.

In light of the escalating malnutrition crisis in Bunyoro, the time to act is now. Governments, civil society organisations, and development partners must prioritise investments in climate-smart agriculture as a strategic intervention to address the root causes of malnutrition and build resilience in vulnerable communities.

By fostering synergy between agricultural development, environmental sustainability, and nutrition security, we can create a future where every child has access to nutritious food and the opportunity to thrive.

In conclusion, investing in climate-smart agriculture is not only a prudent response to the challenges of climate change but also a powerful tool for reducing malnutrition and improving livelihoods in Bunyoro.

By embracing innovative agricultural practices that enhance resilience, promote sustainability, and prioritise nutrition, we can create a more prosperous and equitable future for all. Let us seize this opportunity to sow the seeds of change and nourish the health and wellbeing of generations to come.",monitor.co.ug,news,Daily Monitor,,-0.02745098039215688,448976688,1,https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/4498550/3f42b603035fcca1a07640d557dd3956/letters02pix-data.jpg,

I'm shopping for plants,"" said city of Chico management analyst Jeannette Hassur during the Local Nursery Crawl on Saturday morning.

The 10th annual Local Nursery Crawl spans Saturday and today and includes 15 plant nurseries in Butte County.

For the event, participants were offered a flyer with the names of each participating nursery on it. If participants got the flyer stamped by six different nurseries, they could enter into a raffle for a gift certificate at the final nursery they went to. ""This event is to get the public to visit/discover the many independent nurseries in the area and inspire loyalty and community support for local business,"" states the event's Facebook page.

This year is Hassur's ""fifth or sixth"" year participating in the crawl. At Little Red Hen Plant Nursery she bought dwarf mondo grass she plans to plant in between the sandstones of her walkway.

In 2023, the event was held in February. However, this year it was moved to March.

""It's been a lot busier with more people coming in,"" said Little Red Hen Nursery instructor Karen Brewster. ""They're (customers) more ready to plant. February is too early.""

During the crawl, Little Red Hen Nursery offered 15% off everything except tomatoes.

Fair Street Nursery hosted the Chico Bonsai Society on Saturday. Some of the small trees on display were over 40 years old.

In addition to Fair Street Nursery's many out door plants for sale, the company also sell indoor plants in a warm heated room. It also sells artisan decorations from local artists for the garden.

At Harvests and Habitats Nursery perennials, vegetables and wildflowers sold the most, said employee Suzie McAllister.

""People are starting to dream about their garden for the spring and summer,"" McAllister said.

Harvests and Habitats Nursery owner Sherri Scott said it is nice having the crawl in March because more plants are blooming.

""I like that, but it's also the really busy time for me planting everything because we grow everything ourselves, or like 95% of it ourselves. ... I have not slept,"" she said with a laugh.

For those looking a well rounded plant that smells amazing and is low maintenance, McAllister and Scott recommend scented geranium.

""They're like a low key superhero,"" McAllister said. ""They don't have a big showy a blossom, they still attract pollinators and they just smells so good.""

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no.

The power utility firm says it has heightened crackdown on theft of electrical equipment and surveillance of its network across the coastal region.

Eng. Phineas Marete the firm's Manager for Coast region says Kenya power is out to curb vandalism that impacts on the power distribution network.

Eng. Marete says they are working closely with the security agencies and National Government Administrative Officers (NGAO) in the crackdown of vandalism that targets the electricity infrastructure.

""The unfortunate acts of vandalism that targets the electricity assets such as transformers and electricity towers usually plunges Kenyans into darkness,"" he said.

Marete expressed the views at a forum in Pride Inn Hotel organized by the power utility firm for journalists based in Kwale County.

He says while customers grapple with electricity shortages the situation is often compounded by incessant vandalism of power assets.

""Increase of cases of vandalism and energy theft through illegal connections has prompted us to work with the security agencies to assist us in the protection of our power installations to enable work to go on effectively,"" he said.

He says increased incidents of vandalism of electrical assets in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties leads to power supply disruptions and huge financial and reputational losses to the power company.

The KPLC regional official termed the state of theft and vandalism of transformers and power line cables in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties as deplorable.

He says rampant vandalism in the three coastal counties has forced KPLC to rope in the security agencies in the hunt for the vandals.

He says the police and KPLC have come together to fight off vandalism of power systems, equipment and materials blamed on scrap metal businesses.

""Cases of vandalism forces us to expend a lot of resources in repairing and replacing damaged power equipment,"" he said and called on concerted efforts from stakeholders to contain the menace.

He reiterated the resolve of KPLC towards fighting vandalism and called on well-meaning and law-abiding Kenyans to work together with the power company in fighting the menace.

Marete says darkness caused by vandalism and energy theft threatens the economy as industries are shut because companies cannot meet production targets and may operate below installed capacity.

He says vandalism runs counter to the country's quest for improved and steady power supply for domestic and industrial purposes.

""We want all and sundry to join us in the fight against vandalism of vital power assets from the grip of criminals,"" he said.

Eng. Marete says KPLC will not waver from its mandate of providing quality, safe and reliable electricity services despite the numerous setbacks it faces such as the twin problems of theft and vandalism.

Eng. Marete at the same time urged road agencies such as Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) to liaise with the power company during road constructions.

He says the road agencies should seek their input whenever building new roads and upgrading existing ones to safeguard electricity poles along the roads.

""We have realized whenever new roads are being put up or old ones expanded they lead to the collapse of electricity poles and result in disruption of power supplies,"" he said.",kenyanews.go.ke,news,kenyanews.go.ke,,0.05098039215686279,448976143,1,,

Recently, West's chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, released a letter on behalf of the 46-year-old rapper calling out the music industry to call his boss Ye. Yiannopoulos also explained in the letter why West chose to forego his former stage name.

In the letter obtained by Page Six, the staff of Praise God rapper said, ""Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, on par with presidents and popes."" Yiannopoulos continued, ""He didn't take the decision to change his name, potentially sacrificing some of the immense value captured by the brand of 'Kanye West,' lightly. The change was made fully, legally, and permanently. This is who he is now. His name is Ye.""

He went on to say, ""We are reaching out to streaming platforms, publishers, stores, unions, lyrics websites and data resellers,"" adding, ""This change will happen everywhere. Your platform has been identified as one of the most visible places this change may occur, and we passionately hope you will be able to fully and properly reflect the new name and identity of such an enormously influential and historic figure.""

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant:

The Karnataka state government launched its Engineering R&D (ER&D) Policy 2021, a first-of-its-kind state-level policy to foster innovation and address the evolving needs of the changing global tech landscape.

While addressing the audience during the launch event on Tuesday, March 2,20201, Dr. Ashwathnarayan C. N, Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka said that the policy is aimed at enabling the state to contribute about 45 percent of India's engineering R&D economy.

""Karnataka is today the leading contributor to India's ER&D revenue. I am proud to say that the state is home to over 400 leading organisations. Karnataka is also home to a thriving multi-disciplinary innovation ecosystem. To further elevate the conducive platform for research in the state, the Government of Karnataka has yet again pioneered by launching the new ER&D Policy,"" he says.

According to the official policy, this initiative is aimed at augmenting the state's leadership in ER&D, boosting competitiveness among state players, and accelerating technology-led economic growth.

The policy has been mainly formulated to attract MNCs to establish their ER&D centres in the state, market the engineering advantages Karnataka offers to global organisations, and also generate job opportunities.

As a part of this policy, the Government of Karnataka (GoK) will provide:

1) Reimbursement of 50 percent of rent up to Rs 2 crore or Rs 1,666 per employee per month to an MNC Indian entity for setting up or expanding GCC (Global Capability Centres) in engineering R&D beyond Bengaluru urban district;

2) GoK will also offer recruitment assistance of Rs 20 lakh to MNC Indian entities for setting up or expanding operations beyond Bengaluru urban district;

3) The government will provide an investment subsidy of 20 percent up to Rs 2 crore for setting up GCCs beyond Bengaluru urban district; and

4) GoK will consider applicants meeting two criteria - i) Providing employment greater or equal to 3,000 people and ii) Will investment size of Rs 250 crore and above.

Dr. Ashwathnarayan added that the policy includes five priority sectors including i) Aerospace and Defence; ii) Software products; iii) Automobile, Auto components and Electric Vehicles; iv) Biotechnology, Pharma, and Medical devices; and v) Semiconductors, Telecom and Electronics System Design and Manufacturing.

During the event, he also said that the policy will facilitate the government's Beyond Bengaluru vision and fuel ER&D opportunities in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. ""This will boost domestic manufacturing capabilities and uphold the spirit of MakeInIndia,"" he adds.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

Hineline argued that writing down seasonal milestones can reduce the oppressive feeling of unease you get when you see the dogwood trees putting out flowers before Easter. We, as humans, are susceptible to an idea from ecology called shifting baseline syndrome, in which we too easily mentally adapt to degradations in our environment because we don't remember how things used to be. We question ourselves (Wait ... that's not right); we rationalize (Was Easter earlier last year, maybe?). Taking notes through the years, Hineline argued, could help. Henry David Thoreau did something similar: He kept a written record of the blooming of local wildflowers, though he probably could not have anticipated that these notes would aid climate scientists over 150 years later.

I thought about Hineline's directive recently. Here in southeastern Ohio, spring is early this year, like it is in many places. But I didn't get just how early until I was downloading old copies of my TinyLetter after that company announced it was shuttering its services. I happened to see that on March 13, 2016, I had noted in my weekly missive that the daffodils were out, trees were in bud, and there were tree frogs singing. ""It's too early for this, by a full two or three weeks,"" 2016 me wrote.

Reading this, 2024 me realized I'd lost the plot. When our daffies came out on March 3 this year, I'd thought, ""Well, at least it's not February."" My baselines! They're shifting!!!

I am not so much a paper record keeper anymore, so while it's not very Thoreauvian, I decided to take my tracking efforts digital. I made a Google spreadsheet, the kind I have for everything else: planning for our child's summer camps, notes about Christmas admin, addresses of friends and family. And I made a column for all the spring milestones I could think of. Spring peepers come earliest for us, or so I think. Then forsythia, daffodils, magnolias, robins, and cherry trees, on down the line.

The good thing about doing this in Google format is that I can add many more columns, as I remember that they exist, and rows, as I happen upon data about past years in photos and emails. (I just remembered: I posted to Instagram the week of March 11, 2020, when I was on social media a lot for some huge, world-changing reason I won't mention here, to show how the forsythia was in full bloom. Into the doc, you go!) In the fall, I will add a sheet to note when the first frost comes, and when the leaves come off different trees in our neighborhood.

I know that keeping track of early spring won't make early spring stop happening. But there's something about having the data that just makes me feel less at sea. And because I'm highly susceptible to gamification, I am now going to go look up the names of more wildflowers so I can make more columns. The world is changing; maybe sometime in the future, someone trying to pin down exactly how can use my notes. For now, doing this makes me, personally, feel 5 to 7 percent better. I'll take it.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.003921568627450966,448975631,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nliOVRTEvAuBtpLEBwKZ.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/slate_773/3c9eae005eb1b8bcee3d6a232030c2ba,

The remarkable achievement not only underscores the project's immense popularity and the growing interest in meme-based digital ventures but also highlights the evolving landscape of investment in the digital age. Below, we delve into the intricacies of Pundu's success story, exploring the factors that contributed to its rapid fundraising, the implications for the meme project sector, and what the future holds for Pundu and similar digital endeavors.

The digital realm has witnessed its fair share of rapid rises and falls, stories of overnight successes, and tales of unexpected downturns. However, the narrative of Pundu stands out not just for its swift financial achievement but for what it signifies about the current state of digital investment. In a world where traditional investment avenues are increasingly being complemented (and sometimes replaced) by more dynamic, culture-driven opportunities, Pundu's success is a testament to the shifting paradigms of value in the digital age.

Investors, both seasoned and newcomers, are beginning to look beyond the conventional metrics of company valuation, exploring instead the potential of projects to capture and engage with a global audience through relatable, viral content. Pundu, with its meme-centric approach, has evidently tapped into a vein of digital culture that resonates with millions worldwide, making it an attractive proposition for those looking to invest in the burgeoning field of digital entertainment and engagement.

At the heart of Pundu's appeal is its unabashed embrace of meme culture. Memes, once considered mere internet frivolity, have evolved into a powerful medium of communication, capable of transcending language barriers and fostering a sense of community among disparate groups. Pundu's project leverages the universal appeal, creating a platform that not only entertains but also engages its audience in a shared digital experience.

The strategy has proven to be incredibly effective, as demonstrated by the rapid fundraising achievement. By aligning its goals with the intrinsic values of meme culture -- humor, relatability, and a touch of irreverence -- Pundu has managed to create a project that feels both fresh and familiar to its target audience. The alignment has not only facilitated its fundraising efforts but has also positioned Pundu as a pioneering figure in the integration of meme culture into digital ventures.

The success of Pundu's fundraising campaign has far-reaching implications for the digital project landscape. Firstly, it serves as a clear indicator of the viability of meme-based projects as serious investment opportunities. As digital culture continues to evolve, the ability of projects like Pundu to engage with audiences on a cultural and emotional level will likely become a key metric for investment potential.

Moreover, Pundu's achievement could pave the way for a new wave of digital ventures that seek to blend entertainment with engagement, leveraging the viral nature of memes to create platforms that are not only financially successful but also culturally impactful. The future for Pundu, following the fundraising milestone, appears bright. With a substantial financial foundation now in place, the project has the opportunity to expand its offerings, refine its platform, and perhaps most importantly, continue to innovate within the space of meme culture and digital engagement.

As Pundu looks to the future, it does so with the backing of a robust investor base, a clear validation of its cultural resonance, and the potential to redefine the boundaries of digital ventures. The story of Pundu is not just one of financial success; it is a narrative about the power of cultural connection in the digital age, the evolving landscape of investment, and the endless possibilities that arise when creativity and culture converge in the digital realm.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no. Sometimes it's our handwork which brings us such changes, and we are not even prepared for such changes, yet it's our own handwork.",falmouthpacket.co.uk,news,Cornwall Packet,,-0.0980392156862745,448975517,1,https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/resources/images/17894587/,

Co-founder Gabby Dizon envisions the organization not merely as a guild but as a foundational infrastructure for fostering a network of crypto gamers. The vision aims to unite, collaborate, and propel various groups within the digital realm towards collective success. The inception of Yield Guild Games was marked by a strategic move to dominate the guild landscape through Axie Infinity, leveraging the game's play-to-earn model that gained prominence during the 2021 crypto and NFT bull run.

The guild's evolution was fueled by significant investment from industry giants like Andreessen Horowitz and a notable sponsorship from the crypto exchange FTX, highlighting its pivotal role in the play-to-earn ecosystem. Despite the challenges faced by the play-to-earn model, Yield Guild Games persevered through the bear market, investing in a diverse portfolio of game assets and laying the groundwork for a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO) structure to support regional sub-DAOs. The groundwork is poised to cater to the burgeoning wave of high-quality crypto games, such as Pixels and Parallel, signaling a transformative phase for Yield Guild Games from a singular guild entity to a comprehensive guild protocol.

The transition towards becoming a guild protocol represents a significant leap for Yield Guild Games, aiming to establish an infrastructure layer that enables the existence and prosperity of all guilds, both on-chain and within gaming ecosystems. The initiative seeks to introduce tokenized credentials, asset and role management tools, and deep integrations with blockchain games. Such integrations are designed to facilitate communal quests and rewards, enhancing the gaming experience and fostering a sense of unity among players. The recent launch of the guild system in Pixels, a leading crypto game, exemplifies the new direction, with Yield Guild Games playing a crucial role in shaping the game's competitive and collaborative dynamics.

Pixels' guild system, envisioned by founder Luke Barwikowski, aims to revolutionize the gaming landscape by enabling competitive play and equitable resource distribution among players. The system is supported by Yield Guild Games' infrastructure, which offers a standardized tech stack for guild management, transcending the limitations of traditional platforms like Discord servers. The integration within Pixels is substantial, potentially setting a precedent for future blockchain game developments and highlighting the need for a unified infrastructure to support the burgeoning web3 gaming sector.

Yield Guild Games' journey through the highs and lows of the Axie Infinity era has equipped the organization with invaluable insights into the needs and challenges of gaming guilds. With a focus on creating a transparent, composable, and interoperable on-chain environment, Yield Guild Games is dedicated to facilitating the growth and scalability of guilds as the ""small-to-medium enterprises of Web3."" This commitment is further evidenced by the organization's strategic investments and the development of on-chain tools, including multisig wallets, NFT badges, and role-defining allowlists, slated for release in Q2 2024.

In addition to infrastructure development, Yield Guild Games continues to amass a significant collection of in-game NFT assets, enhancing the protocol's utility and accessibility for guild members. The protocol's innovative approach to asset borrowing and the potential establishment of a ""credit rating"" system for guilds underscore the organization's dedication to fostering a responsible and collaborative gaming community. Through strategic partnerships, investments, and a focus on educational content, Yield Guild Games is not only challenging the narrative around guilds but also demonstrating the positive impact these organizations can have on the gaming ecosystem and beyond.

As Yield Guild Games transitions into a guild protocol, it sets a new standard for collaboration, innovation, and community engagement in the crypto gaming world. By providing the necessary infrastructure and support for guilds, Yield Guild Games is paving the way for a more inclusive, competitive, and sustainable future for on-chain gaming. The evolution marks a significant milestone in the organization's journey, reflecting its commitment to changing the narrative around guilds and showcasing the potential for positive contributions to the digital art and gaming communities.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.3960784313725489,448975507,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

The whitepaper's publication is a pivotal moment, as it will allow stakeholders to gain a deep understanding of the project's mechanics, its value proposition, and how it intends to navigate the complexities of the digital asset ecosystem.

Furthermore, the whitepaper will detail the technical specifications and the economic model of the $GM tokens, providing essential information for developers, investors, and users. It's an opportunity for the community to assess the project's potential for scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. As such, all eyes will be on the release, with the community eager to dissect and discuss its contents, which could very well set the tone for the project's future engagements and developments.

Another significant milestone on the agenda is the $GM token's pre-market listing on WhalesMarket. The event marks a crucial step in the project's market introduction strategy, offering early investors and enthusiasts a first glance and the opportunity to engage with the $GM tokens. WhalesMarket, known for its curated selection of promising digital assets, provides a platform that emphasizes informed trading and investment decisions. The pre-market listing is not just a testament to the $GM project's potential but also an endorsement of its credibility and viability in the competitive digital asset market.

The pre-market phase is critical for building momentum and establishing a solid investor base before the tokens become widely available on larger exchanges. It's a period characterized by heightened activity and interest, as participants vie to secure their stake in the project. For the $GM project, the listing is an opportunity to demonstrate market demand and investor confidence, which are vital for the project's long-term success. As such, the community and potential investors are advised to keep a close watch on WhalesMarket for updates on the listing details and to prepare for what promises to be an exciting phase in the project's rollout.

The reveal of the pre-sale allocation for the $GM tokens is another critical item on next week's agenda. The announcement is eagerly awaited by the community, as it will clarify the number of tokens available for early investment. The pre-sale phase is an essential component of the project's fundraising and market entry strategy, allowing early supporters to participate directly in the project's growth. By securing their $GM tokens early, investors not only demonstrate their faith in the project's vision but also gain the potential for early returns on their investment.

Moreover, the pre-sale allocation reveal will provide transparency regarding the project's approach to token distribution and economics. It's an opportunity for the project to showcase its commitment to fair and equitable practices, ensuring that the community and early backers are adequately rewarded for their support. As anticipation builds, potential investors and project enthusiasts are advised to stay tuned for the official announcement, which will offer detailed information on how to participate in the pre-sale and secure their allocation of $GM tokens.

The upcoming week is set to be a landmark period for the $GM project, with the unveiling of the whitepaper, the pre-market listing on WhalesMarket, and the pre-sale allocation reveal. Each of these events carries significant implications for the project's future and its community. Stakeholders are encouraged to engage actively with these developments, as they collectively represent a forward leap in the project's journey towards establishing a robust and vibrant digital asset ecosystem.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.4352941176470588,448975495,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

The North Shore Business Improvement Association's Clean Team was busy last year, picking up more than 19,700 pounds of garbage in 2023 and removing nearly 2,000 graffiti tags.

Jeremy Heighton, NSBIA executive director, presented in front of city council earlier this month, providing an update on the program that employs people with lived experience of homelessness or substance use to help clean city streets.

Heighton noted the Clean Team -- which operates with support from the City of Kamloops, WorkBC, Open Door Group and a number of social agencies -- is in its second full year of operations.

The Clean Team launched in the fall of 2022.

""This program is successful, positive and provides results for both our community and those who participate,"" Heighton said.

He said he will be highlighting the project at the Southern Interior Local Government Association conference in April, ""discussing collaboration, creative funding and the value of civic and BIA relationships across the province.""

According to statistics from the NSBIA, three Clean Team participants have moved on to find other gainful employment, and two have been hired by the business improvement association as team leads.

Two people dropped out of the program due to relapse or other challenges, with one returning after recovery.

Last year, the team picked up 19,710 pounds of garbage, 7,983 harm prevention units, 164 shopping carts, 1,940 cardboard boxes, and removed 1,858 tags.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

The 2024 edition has added new initiatives as it moves towards its goal of zero impact.

Environmental responsibility is at the heart of the Trofeo Princesa Sofia Mallorca by Iberostar's overarching philosophy. As part of its commitment to sustainability, for the 2023 edition the Olympic class regatta signed an agreement with the Mallorcan company Trueworld to implement an action plan aimed at neutralising its carbon footprint, carrying out initiatives to analyse and measure air quality, monitor the seabed in the Bay of Palma and organise awareness-raising workshops.

As a result, the race received the prestigious UN Recognition of Carbon Footprint Calculation and Offsetting. ""This certificate is a milestone in the responsibility of the regatta and its organisation. It means not only that we have taken the maximum measures to reduce our environmental impact, but also that we have taken on the challenge of involving the entire value chain to create a zero net impact event,"" explains geographer Marco Mendoza, CEO and founder of Trueworld.

This certificate confirms the efforts made by the event in terms of environmental issues. ""The result allows us to conclude that this is a regatta with a very low impact in its organisation and practically zero in its sporting execution. We should encourage this type of activity with low environmental impact and with a strong message of commitment, and a strong international image and a serious responsibility,"" he continued.

Zero impact is the objective that the event has set itself in its strategic plan, but the reality is that in an event with more than a thousand sailors and dozens of inflatable boats there are areas where this is not yet feasible.

""We are aware of the limitations,"" admits Javier Zaynoun, director of the Trofeo Princesa Sofia Mallorca by Iberostar. ""There are areas, such as the transport of competitors and equipment to Mallorca, that require polluting means of transport, it is an obvious fact that we cannot ignore. However, whenever there is an alternative, we always choose the most sustainable one"".

Trueworld explains that there are tools to compensate for unavoidable carbon emissions, and that their use has enabled it to obtain the certificate: ""Emissions that cannot really be reduced are compensated by funding projects certified by the United Nations or by the Ministry of Ecological Transition.""

""In addition to the social programme, in which various organisations with young people at risk of social exclusion can take part in various workshops to bring sport and the sea to these most vulnerable groups, support is also given to local projects aimed at preserving, promoting or regenerating the natural environment,"" the company added.

According to Mendoza, environmental awareness on the Sofia is growing every day: ""The sailors are an essential part of helping us to strengthen the message of sustainability and increase public interest. Let's not forget that the organisation is not yet legally obliged to measure or compensate for this type of event, but it has implemented this programme and invested in making it an integral part of the organisation"".

More steps for 2024

The measures adopted in the previous edition will continue in the 53rd Trofeo Princesa Sofia Mallorca by Iberostar, which will be held from 29 March to 6 April. Trueworld has announced the implementation of new initiatives: ""This year the organisers want to control water consumption, promote the use of efficient vehicles, share transfers and use local suppliers as much as possible.""

""We will also have two electric boats for the various educational and public activities that will take place at sea: the Stenella, which we already used last year, will be joined by the Blue Circle, the first 100% electric swallow in the Balearic Islands, in a firm commitment to sustainable sailing with a view to decarbonising the sector,"" the company concluded.

As Zaynoun points out, the Sofia's journet is progressing in parallel with the philosophy of its main sponsor: ""Iberostar itself is a benchmark in terms of environmental awareness, so it is very easy for us to work with them in this environment. Not only are they open to the ideas we propose, but they are particularly proactive in proposing initiatives to reduce the impact of the event, educate current and future generations, and promote changes that help improve our environment"".

The 53rd Trofeo S.A.R. Princesa Sofía Mallorca by Iberostar is jointly organised by the Club Nàutic S'Arenal, the Club Marítimo San Antonio de la Playa, the Real Club Náutico de Palma, the Real Federación Española de Vela and the Federación Balear de Vela, with the support of World Sailing and the main public institutions of the Balearic Islands.",insidethegames.biz,news,www.insidethegames.biz,"Karate, David Rubio Salguero",0.3019607843137255,448975105,1,https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/294574/o/Sailing.jpg,

About a year ago, we purchased a solar array for the house. Although it's effectiveness varies from month to month and I am not always seeing the benefit for the cost as promised, one thing is certain -- from Wednesday afternoon as the storm was rolling in, through Sunday and part of Monday, it produced nothing with all the snow we got.

All I could think about was how would this play out if Jared Polis and the rest of the DNC force us all to depend on ""Green Energy""? How would those thousands of acres of solar panels help us covered in snow? This storm also had little wind associated with it, so windmills wouldn't have been much help. How manty acres of batteries (made mostly in China) would be needed to cover that kind of back-up storage? How many man-hours would it take to get a crew out there to shovel off the solar arrays so we don't freeze in the dark? Better yet, how would that get paid for? Another one-time ""fee"" that would never go away?

Once again, when you look closer, or have first hand experience as our house does, free and clean, dependable energy is anything but.

Criminals would love this bill

As someone who values the Gazette's state and local news coverage, I was surprised that your March 21 article ""State lawmakers advance 'assault' weapons ban"" failed to mention how House Bill 24-1292 actually defines an assault weapon. For example, if the proposed bill seeks to ban most common firearms used for self-defense, home defense, and marksmanship -- including many types of handguns -- then the overwhelming majority of law-abiding Coloradans would vigorously oppose it.

Criminals, on the other hand, would love it, because, if passed into law, their victims would then be unable to defend themselves. The details of this bill matter greatly, so please strive to keep the public fully-informed on precisely which types of firearms this Democrat-sponsored legislation would take away from Colorado's residents.

That's not the point! ""illegal immigrants"" shouldn't be here in the first place!

As soon as they cross our border illegally, they commit a crime.

We have enough crime committed by our own ""native-born Americans"". We do not need to import more.

The sate of the economy

Recent letters to the editor and a column by Mike Rosen regarding the US and Colorado economies lay blame on Democrats. They need economic education and the facts. Fortunately much of that is readily available in the Gazette from Tatiana Bailey, Eric Sondermann, and Barry Fagin.

For example, one letter criticized Bailey's article on private investment buying up homes. The letter writer missed the fact that Bailey's point was that private investment was competing with ordinary home buyers, thus artificially driving up demand. Another writer argued that we should vote for Donald Trump because of how much the Biden administration has increased the debt. The fact is that under Republican administrations, the deficit as a percent of GDP has increased over six percent more than during Democratic administrations. Trump's administration was the worst, but that was greatly affected by COVID and supply chain problems, as was the first year of the Biden administration. However, prior to COVID hitting, the deficit as a percent of GDP was worse during the Trump administration than any other except Ronald Regan's and Barrack Obama's first terms. That was mainly due to Trump's tax reform act passed in 2017. In Obama's case he was dealing with the big financial crisis of 2008.

As both Sondernann and Fagin point out, neither party has a track record of being fiscally responsible, but it's been worse under Republican administrations. Fagin's opinion on shrinkflation was spot on; this is a private business matter the government has no business regulating. He was wrong, however, about the effect on CPI (Consumer Price Index). Shrinkflation has no effect on the CPI because it's based on cost per unit (e.g., cost per ounce).

Widely unpopular rematch

Every day as we move forward with the upcoming Presidential election with the certain candidacies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden cause great concern for the future of our country. This rematch is widely unpopular. Having to cast a vote, not on the merits of the candidate, but trying to determine who is the least worst is deeply unsettling. The ""lesser of two evils"". The article in Sunday's ""Perspective"" by W. James Antle III brings up more questions than answers with regard to the Republican Party's future with Donald Trump at the helm.

As Mr. Antle said ""(Trump) is broadly unpopular especially among college educated suburban voters and women. I count myself as part of that population.

We endured from 2017 to 2021, constant indications of Trump making ""un-Presidential"" tweets on a daily basis. His constant name calling is obnoxious.

If my son, when he was six years old called his school friends names, I would have put him in a chair facing a corner like Dennis the Menace.

I know my vile opinion of Trump is not popular in Colorado Springs, but I have been a registered Republican for just about 50 years. Never in my life have I felt such distain for the presumed candidate, and feeling gloom and doom if he is elected again.

I'm considering voting Democratic (for the first time in my life) to get the House back to Democratic led if Trump is re-elected, so there will be some forum to stop him from making horrendous decisions detrimental to our country (Russia, North Korea, China, Ukraine, Gaza, Israel and most importantly NATO)

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

Ripple's Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz recently unveiled updates regarding his trading bot, sparking intrigue within the XRP community. The bot, developed by Schwartz, operates on an algorithm reminiscent of XRP Ledger's AMM algorithm. Initially designed for trading on centralized exchanges, Schwartz disclosed that the bot has undergone testing, primarily focusing on Solana.

In a recent development, Schwartz disclosed the implementation of a new strategy for the bot, envisioning three distinct AMMs for Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana. This adjustment, he explains, allows for a more aggressive approach, enabling the bot to take on additional risk while expanding trading opportunities. As per previous estimates, Schwartz expressed optimism about the bot's profitability, estimating an annual return of approximately 11%.

Importantly, Schwartz clarified that AMMs are not exclusive to XRP, as they can be created with any two assets supported by XRP Ledger. However, he predicted that AMMs involving XRP will likely dominate, attributing this to the algorithm's bias toward volatility harvesting, particularly advantageous in volatile markets.

Meanwhile, controversy surrounds the XRPL AMM, the foundation upon which Schwartz's bot is built. RippleX, the developer arm of Ripple, has identified discrepancies in certain AMM pools, resulting in transaction execution issues.

As a precautionary measure, RippleX has advised against depositing new funds into these pools until the discrepancies are rectified. According to the report, the engineering team is working alongside community participants to address the issue, promising timely updates to the community.",u.today,news,u.today,Gamza Khanzadaev,0.1294117647058823,448974836,1,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2024-03/s1723.1.jpg,eng-9417934

Sitting Mayo Fianna Fáil councillors should brace for impact.

If I've been a prophet of doom in past columns about the fate of the 'Republican Party', after the recent referendums I fear further betrayal by their voters and predict a potential annihilation at the ballot box in June.

Willie O'Dea is the latest to come out vehemently against government partners, the Greens.

James O'Connor from Cork added his voice to a shots fired social media post that said: ""Fianna Fáil needs to get back to basics & abandon the Hate Speech Bill etc.Focus on Housing, Health and Law & Order and stop playing to the woke gallery.

""Start listening to the people, stop talking down to them and stop listening to the out of touch Greens & NGOs #Referendum2024""

A statement that adds muster to Billy Kelleher and Barry Cowen's recent attacks on the Greens.

Indeed, even Lisa Chambers has had a potshot at her coalition partners and admitted she voted No in the care referendum.

She told Newstalk it was 'condescending' especially on International Women's Day to hold the vote and echoed the sentiment of Willie O'Dea who feels those in positions of power are out of step with the common folk.

This reactionary Fianna Fáilers, who have ironically now started playing to the gallery by repeating many of the far-right extremists talking points, is the last whimper of a dying breed.

It's one final lash-out as they witness decades of support whittle away.

Fewer and fewer party activists are willing to lend their support and canvass for the party. Seemingly Bertie's scandals didn't quash the party, but an allegiance with Fine Gael and the Greens will result in destruction at the ballot box.

Peadar Toibín will clean up in European Parliamentary elections, and Fianna Fáil may struggle to even get one of their 'stale, pale and only 33% less male' trio over the line in the Midlands North West constituency.

On the local front, it could be a washout, and stalwarts such as Al McDonnell and Blackie Gavin may well be vulnerable for the first time in a long time.

Martin McLoughlin also faces an unenviable uphill task as many Fianna Fáil councillors across the country are entering their final months in the role.

Sean Carey in Belmullet looks weak too and it could be nervy for Annie May Reape, who could be saying goodbye to a long-held Ballina seat.

Sinn Féin, Independents and Aontú will sweep up their seats on June 7. Toibín is sure to get Paul Lawless over the line in Claremorris and Tommy Horan will come close in Swinford.

Brendan Mulroy looks poachable in Westport, and so too do the two sitting Fianna Fáilers in east Mayo.

Remarkably, Fianna Fáil picked up a seat in 2019 and currently has 11 sitting councillors, a number which could be more than halved in a few weeks.

Fianna Fáil, for all their faults, are much closer to the people on the ground, and that's why we're seeing and hearing such open revolts from many of their party figures.

Party leader Micheál Martin prefers to lead like an ostrich and ignore the fundamental flaws within his party.

Fine Gael remains intact with an identifiable brand, one that will see them even pick up seats in the county.

Keogh in Westport, Peyton in Swinford, Rouse in Ballina and Gallagher in Claremorris come to mind.

The fact blueshirts even have fresh blood is striking. In comparison, Fianna Fáil is a coagulated, scabby mess.

When people rip off the plaster in June the scars will be laid bare for all to see.

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",theuknews.com,news,The UK News,,0.3098039215686275,448974538,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no.

While we often focus on decluttering our homes - clearing out closets, sorting through pantries, and reorganizing living spaces - it's equally important to focus on our financial well-being. Now is the perfect time to sort out your finances and ensure that your money matters are as organized and efficient as the rest of your household. Below, we outline a few key steps to help tidy up your financial situation, from maximizing contributions to retirement accounts to planning for summer expenses. So let's start preparing our financial house for a brighter year ahead.

Adjust your contributions

First, it's important to reassess your contributions to retirement accounts such as your IRA, 401(k), and any HSA or FSA accounts you may have. In 2024, the IRS has updated the maximum contribution limits for these accounts. Taking stock of these changes and increasing your contributions accordingly can help you maximize your savings and the associated tax advantages.

Making these adjustments early in the year can greatly benefit your long-term financial health, ensuring you're on the right track toward a secure retirement. Take a moment to check the new limits and adjust your contributions as needed.

Roll over old retirement plans

Life changes, and so do jobs. If you've embarked on a new career path this year, don't leave your old 401(k) or retirement plans gathering dust. Rolling over these accounts into your new employer's plan or an IRA can consolidate your savings and give you better control over your investment choices.

Revisit your financial goals

Check in on your financial goals for the year. It's common for priorities to shift or for unexpected challenges to lead you off your planned course. Instead of viewing this as a setback, see it as an opportunity to recalibrate your financial strategies. I

dentify the areas where you've drifted from your goals, and determine what adjustments are needed to either realign with your original intentions or set new, more realistic targets. This proactive approach not only aids in getting you back on track but also enhances the likelihood of achieving or even surpassing your goals for the year.

Allocate your tax refund wisely

For many, the arrival of a tax refund feels like bonus money. But a strategic approach towards using this refund can significantly enhance your financial security. So before you splurge, prioritize strengthening your emergency fund to cover three to six months of living expenses if you haven't already.

This financial buffer helps you navigate life's uncertainties, from a sudden job loss to unexpected medical bills, without derailing your long-term financial plans. Consider your tax refund as an opportunity to solidify your financial foundation, providing you with peace of mind and stability in case of unforeseen circumstances.

Max out last year's IRA contributions

If you haven't taken full advantage of your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contributions for 2023 and your financial situation permits, now's the time to act. The IRS allows contributions for a given tax year up until the tax filing deadline of the following year. This means you still have a window of opportunity to contribute to your IRA for 2023 before this year's tax deadline.

Doing so can reduce your taxable income for 2023, providing immediate tax relief. Also, maximizing your IRA contributions enhances your retirement savings, capitalizing on the compounding growth potential over time. This strategic move not only helps in tax savings but also strengthens your financial security in retirement.

Budget for summer expenses

As you start dreaming of summer vacations, be sure to incorporate these plans into your budget. Assess the amount you intend to spend on things like travel, outings, and other activities, and start earmarking part of your income or savings. This proactive approach can help you enjoy your time off without the stress of overspending and derailing your financial goals.

Spring cleaning your financial house doesn't have to be a daunting task. By taking these steps, you can ensure your finances are tidy, organized, and well-prepared for the rest of the year.

Ryley said Echo already handles thousands of monthly shipments to and from Mexico and the number will grow with the expansion.

""Echo is obviously a very dynamic company. We work with over 50,000 transport providers, through about 35,000 clients,"" Ryley told FreightWaves. ""These clients have continued to work with us at the Southern border. For the last decade, Echo has actually had cross-border Mexico shipments that the company has handled, but they've handled it from a base in Chicago. Echo has made the decision to increase their investment and put boots on the ground in Mexico, so we can further provide enhanced service for our clients.""

Founded in 2005, Echo Global Logistics is a global provider of supply chain management services.

With the new locations in Laredo, Monterrey and Mexico City, Echo now has 29 operations across the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to Laredo, Echo has Texas operations in Houston and Dallas.

Echo's strategy follows similar recent moves or expansions in Texas or Mexico by other transportation providers and freight brokers, such as Redwood Logistics, C.H. Robinson, Ryder System Inc., Arrive Logistics and BlueGrace Logistics.

Over the past several years, Mexico has emerged as one of the key players in the global supply chain. In 2023, Mexico surpassed Canada and China as the top U.S. trading partner for the year, totaling $798 billion in trade.

Mexico was also the top U.S. trading partner for the month of January, with two-way commerce totaling $64.5 billion.

The port of entry in Laredo, Texas, was the No. 2-ranked U.S. trade gateway during January. Trade at the Laredo port of entry totaled $25 billion for the month.

Ryley said having a presence in Mexico will allow Echo to simplify brokerage services on both sides of the border, along with helping shippers and carriers navigate customs and border crossings.

""We're going to continue to work on the same product we deliver and handle today,"" Ryley said.

""We offer freight brokerage, managed transportation, as well as a bunch of other modes, such as truckload, less-than-truckload, intermodal and expedited shipments all over the Southern border. In the future, we will incorporate those services also into cross-border. We just don't have an exact timeline yet. Some of the service that is managed transportation, we actually do handle for clients cross-border in and out of Mexico, but not intra-Mexico. That's another product we're also looking at, based on client demand, is an intra-Mexico solution.""

At the annual China Development Forum, Apple Inc.'s CEO Tim Cook emphasized the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in aiding businesses committed to reducing carbon footprints. Cook's remarks underscore Apple's steadfast dedication to environmental sustainability and its innovative ambition to combat climate change.

Cook's endorsement of AI in environmental initiatives

Cook's participation in the forum centered on discussions regarding carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation strategies for businesses. Acknowledging Apple's ambitious targets for carbon footprint reduction, Cook highlighted the significance of AI as a powerful tool in achieving environmental goals. He emphasized that while progress has been made, further innovation is imperative for sustainable practices.

Apple's commitment to environmental sustainability has been evident through its endeavors to minimize its carbon footprint. The Apple Watch has been touted as the company's first carbon-neutral product. Apple aims to set industry standards for eco-conscious manufacturing and product development through such initiatives.

During his visit to China, Cook engaged with various stakeholders, including government officials and corporate leaders. Through interactions with supply partners and local businesses, Cook underscored the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing sustainability goals. Partners such as BYD Co., Lens Technology Co., and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. were lauded for their shared commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship.

Environmental focus amid geopolitical challenges

During his visit to China, Cook's emphasis on environmental themes comes amidst growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. By prioritizing sustainability initiatives, Apple seeks to navigate complex international relations while maintaining its commitment to environmental responsibility. The company's dedication to carbon neutrality and plastic reduction aligns with broader global efforts to address climate change.

Apple has set ambitious targets to achieve carbon neutrality across its business by 2030. This comprehensive approach encompasses corporate operations, manufacturing supply chains, and product life cycles. Additionally, Apple aims to eliminate plastic from its product packaging by 2025, demonstrating its commitment to reducing waste and environmental impact.

Impact of sustainable practices

Apple's efforts to reduce plastic packaging in its iPhone 13 lineup resulted in a significant waste reduction, illustrating the tangible impact of sustainable practices when scaled across its vast manufacturing network. Apple sets a precedent for other tech companies to prioritize sustainability by implementing environmentally conscious measures.

Tim Cook's advocacy for integrating artificial intelligence into environmental initiatives underscores Apple's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and combating climate change. Apple aims to lead sustainable business practices through strategic partnerships, innovative solutions, and ambitious goals.

Jeremy Heighton, NSBIA executive director, presented in front of city council earlier this month, providing an update on the program that employs people with lived experience of homelessness or substance use to help clean city streets.

Heighton noted the Clean Team -- which operates with support from the City of Kamloops, WorkBC, Open Door Group and a number of social agencies -- is in its second full year of operations.

The Clean Team launched in the fall of 2022.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

Yet, much remains unknown about the etiology of psychiatric disorders. The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the association between biological, psychological and social factors of risk and resilience and behavioral problems in a birth cohort of Swedish children. 1723 mothers and their children were followed from birth to the age of 12 as part of the South East Sweden Birth Cohort Study (the SESBiC study). Information was gathered through register data, standardized questionnaires and DNA samples.In study I, stability of maternal symptoms of depression and the impact on child behavior at age 12 were investigated. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 12.0 % postpartum. Symptoms of postpartum depression significantly increased the risk for subsequent depressive symptoms 12 years later in women. Children whose mothers reported concurrent symptoms of depression and anxiety had an increased risk for both internalizing and externalizing problems at age 12, but no long term effect on child behavior was seen for postpartum depressive symptoms. The greatest risk was seen for children whose mothers reported symptoms of depression on both occasions. In study II, the impact of gene-environment interaction of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met and experience of life events together with symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety on child behavior at age 12 was studied. A main effect of 5-HTTLPR was noticed, but no geneenvironment effects were shown. Similarly to study I, concurrent symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety were an important predictor of child behavioral problems. A high degree of psychosocial stress around childbirth was found to have long lasting detrimental effects on child behavior, increasing the risk for internalizing problems at age 12. Study III investigated the impact of geneenvironment interactions of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met and life events together with symptoms of maternal depression and birth characteristics on behavioral problems at age 3. Symptoms of postpartum depression were found to predict internalizing as well as externalizing problems in children three years later. Child experience of life events was a stable predictor of behavioral problems across the scales similar to sociodemographic factors such as parental immigration status and unemployment. No gene-environment interaction effects of 5-HTTLPR or BDNF Val66Met were shown. Study IV used the risk factors identified in studies I-III to investigate factors of resilience to behavioral problems at age 12. The l/l genotype of 5-HTTLPR was associated with a lower risk for behavioral problems at age 12, especially for children facing low adversity. Good social functioning was found to be a general resource factor, independent of the level of risk, while an easy temperament was associated with resilience for children with a high degree of adversity. However, effect sizes were small.In summary, the results from the present thesis emphasize the importance of maternal mental health and sociodemographic factors for child mental health at ages 3 and 12, which must be taken into account in clinical settings. Moreover, it adds to the null-findings of the gene-environment effect of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met on behavioral problems in children, but indicates a main effect of 5-HTTLPR on internalizing symptoms at age 12.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.3411764705882353,448974318,18,,

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

The Rockets' win streak is their longest since winning eight in a row in November 2019. Houston closed within 1 ½ games of idle Golden State for 10th place and the last play-in spot in the Western Conference.

""It won't really mean anything if we don't make the playoffs,"" Green said. ""That's the goal everyone has right now. I'm just trying to go out there and be the best version of myself for my teammates.""

Jabari Smith Jr. and Kris Dunn were ejected five seconds into the second quarter after both were assessed technical fouls for fighting. The two threw punches at each other after they got tangled up while the ball was being brought up the court. Players and officials got between them before the scuffle could escalate further.

Dunn said the two ""exchanged a couple words, a couple pushes and the next thing you know we're ejected.""

""For me, I take responsibility for my actions and whatever the league decides for me, I have to respect that,"" Dunn said of possible punishment.

Smith was not made available postgame.

Houston coach Ime Udoka said he thought the altercation was a carryover from when the teams played on Jan. 20 and both players got into it then and were issued technical fouls.

""I think Dunn hit him with a shot, and then, they got wrapped up and threw a few punches,"" Udoka said. ""Basically, nothing landed, but as soon as you throw a punch, you're going to be ejected.""

VanVleet scored 23 points on seven 3-pointers, and Green had 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting in the first half as the Rockets built an 85-55 halftime lead. Houston shot 65% in the first half and was 15 of 24 on 3s.

VanVleet tied James Harden and Chandler Parsons for the single-game franchise record for 3s. Green finished 15 of 22 from the field and was 7 of 11 on 3-pointers.

""I felt good after the first shot,"" VanVleet said. ""Got a couple more clean looks. When it's going in like that, and you get good looks, teammates find you in good spots. We got it going a little bit there, and we were trying to ride that wave a little there.""

Jeff Green scored a season-high 21 points, and Dillon Brooks added 12 points for Houston, which shot 56% for the game. The Rockets improved to 35-35, marking the first time they were at .500 since Jan. 13, when they were 19-19.

John Collins scored a season high-tying 25 points, and Collin Sexton added 20 points and eight assists for the Jazz, who tied a season high with their fifth straight loss.

Utah shot 45% but was 11 of 37 on 3-pointers.

And we have already rehabilitated a municipal facility, made the necessary investments, and soon it will be open for operation for all tourists who visit the beautiful villages of Rugova. So, it has been a request especially of economic operators that serve hoteliers, but also tourists, who are not only in large numbers on winter days for skiing, but also during the summer there is a high frequency of visitors to these villages He believes that during a short period, the health center in Bogë i Rugova will also be put into operation... There was a lack of residents. This was one of the reasons that the earlier operation was stopped and with the increase in the number of tourists , it was necessary"", says Loci.

""During 2023, we had investments in two health facilities built from the beginning, i.e. new facilities. There are two Family Medicine Centers with large areas, each of 600 square meters. One of them has only been opened and is already working, it is about the QMF in Vitomerica, which has been in operation since February 17, and the QMF, number three in Karagaq, which is in the urban area, will be opened on the Liberation Day of Peja, on June 16. They are two capital investments, there are two newly built Family Medicine Centers, new with all the necessary standards, to respond either to the staff who will serve in these centers, but also to the patients who will receive services. the main investment has been to have primary health institutions, responsible, up-to-date, with European parameters"", emphasizes Loci.

In addition to these, Loci tells KosovaPress that another health facility is under construction which will serve as a base for the emergency service of the city of Peja, as well as a training center for all health staff.

""We are building another health facility, which will serve as a base for the emergency, for the emergency service of the city of Peja, as well as be a training center for all health staff, where the necessary training will be carried out practice in that center which is extremely large and modern...Within the diagnostics at KKMF, the ultrasound and the large x-ray cabinet work. There are two cabinets that work and provide services to patients who require medical treatment in these two parts of diagnostics...09:38 During the next month, the project for school students will also be started, for some age groups, it is about students of the third, fifth and ninth grades, where screening, visits medical services for all students of these schools, as well as various health services for those students who need them.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

This initiative, aimed at boosting livestock quality and production, was announced by the Director of Livestock Production, Dr. Bishar Elmi, in Isiolo.

According to Kenya News Agency, with 40,000 doses each for Borana cattle and indigenous breeds, which are expected to improve milk, meat, and skin production significantly. Additionally, the government has devised a strategy to mitigate the impact of drought, a perennial challenge in the region, by establishing 450 feedlots in every county. This development is part of the broader effort to enhance resilience against adverse climatic conditions.

During an event in Isiolo town, where Dr. Elmi engaged with 300 herders celebrating the conclusion of the 'Ufugaji Bora Mashinani' program -- a collaborative initiative between the Northern Rangeland Trust (NRT) and the government -- he highlighted the emphasis on modern livestock management practices. These practices are designed to optimize water usage for grass cultivation, crucial for the feedlots.

The advancement of the Isiolo modern slaughterhouse was also a key topic in Dr. Elmi's address. The facility, nearing completion, is expected to significantly bolster the local and national economy by facilitating meat exports and creating job opportunities. Upon opening, the slaughterhouse will process over 160 camels, 300 cows, and 2,500 goats daily, generating employment for both skilled and unskilled workers.

Furthermore, Dr. Elmi addressed the pressing need to augment meat production to meet both local and international demands. With Kenya's current production standing at 45,000 tonnes against a requirement of 66,000 tonnes, the government's initiatives are timely and pivotal.

Echoing the sentiment for modernization, Isiolo Deputy County Commissioner Mr. Patrick Musango encouraged farmers to adopt advanced technologies and practices like zero grazing to enhance productivity and security. He underscored the necessity of shielding livestock from rustlers, a move that not only protects assets but also lives.

The Deputy County Commissioner also mandated local chiefs to participate in training workshops, ensuring the effective dissemination of government policies and information to the grassroots level, thereby fostering a well-informed and progressive agricultural community.",africanewswire.za.com,news,Africa News Wire,,0.2627450980392156,448972891,18,,

The infomercial headline: ""Climate icon talks hope and regrets."" There's no acknowledgment Gore paid for this message, but it sounds like he did.

McPaper's national climate reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver was like most environmental journalists - extremely one-sided activists, always treating the climate panic as climate ""reality."" That's what Gore's group is called, the ""Climate Reality Project."" Pulver began:

In an era when mounting disasters made worse by the warming climate raise fears for the Earth's future, Al Gore could simply say ""I told you so.""

Instead, the silver-haired grandfather regrets not pushing even harder to raise awareness during his more than four decades of trying to warn the world about the dangers of climate change. ""I guess I could have done more, wish I had done more I guess,"" Gore told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview last week.

Derided by climate change skeptics and pundits for decades, and subjected to memes making light of his concern about global warming, Gore soldiers on.

Then came a list of questions that sounded like they were written by a Gore staffer on his ""Climate Reality Project."" She began by asking what's the ""greatest need"" to address public perception on climate? Gore said more activists in your local community, but added some biblical panic:

Of course Mother Nature is the most powerful advocate. I often say that every night on the TV news is like a nature ride through the Book of Revelation and indeed almost every day now we see these extreme climate-related events all around the world.

When asked ""What's your biggest frustration?,"" Gore said Big Oil's shameless lies:

Well, that we haven't made more progress, and that some of the fossil fuel companies have been shameless in providing, continuing to provide lavish funding for disinformation and misinformation....

I was pretty slow to recognize how important the massive funding of anti-climate messaging was going on. I underestimated the power of greed in the fossil fuel industry, the shamelessness in putting out the lies.... They are continuing to do similar things today to try to fool people and pull the wool over people's eyes just in the name of greed.

""Anti-climate messaging"" is typically skipped in ""objective"" media reporting -- it's loaded with Gore's ""Book of Revelation"" doom and rarely balanced in any way by dissent. Gore demanded the world bow to his will and cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, and words like ""radical"" or ""extreme"" are never used.",conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,0.07450980392156858,448972874,1,,

The Bitcoin protocol reduces the supply of new Bitcoin by 50% via the quadrennial Bitcoin halving. This translates into a 50% reduction in revenue (in BTC terms) for Bitcoin miners and poses indirect implications for cross-chain interoperability.

Bitcoin halving events, occurring approximately every four years, reduce block rewards for Bitcoin miners. The halving process is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol by its elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as is the finite supply of 21 million Bitcoin (BTC).

The last three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020. The first Bitcoin halving in 2012 reduced the reward for mining a block from 50 to 25 BTC. The next Bitcoin halving impact is expected to occur in April 2024, and the halving cycles will continue till 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined.

Cross-chain interoperability refers to the capability of different blockchain networks to seamlessly share information and value. It allows users and assets to move fluidly, fostering blockchain convergence with a more integrated and efficient financial ecosystem.

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is celebrated for its impact on scarcity and value and stands as a behemoth commanding unparalleled market dominance. However, with its proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism and intrinsic design as a highly non-interoperable chain, the Bitcoin blockchain is disconnected from cross-chain synergy discussions. Bitcoin's prominence and market dominance still make it relevant to consider in discussions about interoperability, albeit more indirectly.",cointelegraph.com,news,Cointelegraph,,0.07450980392156858,448972846,1,"https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/0ae2fc6e5811cd4365147c3efcdbc0a5.jpg",eng-9414272

Medi-Cal administers the payment of physicians at a rate of about 25 cents on a dollar

By Patrick Wagner, MD, March 24, 2024 2:55 am

24 Mar 2024 2:55 am

Medi-Cal is California style government run healthcare and as such is the poster child of our national and even our global government healthcare systems. The concept of the government running anything, let alone medical care, is a mistake, a misunderstanding and an illegal misuse of arbitrary power when considering who should be in charge.

My experience as a general surgeon with Medi-Cal in Sacramento for the last two decades of the 20th century and beyond was comprehensive. My dealing with Medi-Cal was a significant part of my practice along with most private healthcare insurances, Medicare, and the Sacramento County Medically Indigent Adult (MIA) Program.

The first time I heard the term Medi-Cal was in 1980 when I arrived on the scene at the UC Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) in Sacramento for my internship and residency training in general surgery. UCDMC was almost brand new at this location as well, and my mentor, F. William Blaisdell, MD, was instrumental in changing the Sacramento County Hospital into a level one trauma center, none more impressive in the USA.

UCDMC was in the perfect location, right in the center of Sacramento, which just happens to be the seat of politics for close to 40 million Californians and the home of thousands of government employees, lobbyists, political staffers, politicians, teachers, union employees and so forth. It is also the intersection of Interstate 80 east to west and Interstate 5 north to south. There are many car wrecks in the area, the source of a lot of blunt trauma. Sacramento is the source of considerable penetrating trauma, the so called ""knife and gun club."" The indigent population continued to frequent the ""new"" teaching county hospital. Blunt trauma patients generally had medical insurance and government employees and teachers always had medical insurance whereas penetrating trauma and indigent patients did not.

For five years as a resident, I learned how to be a general surgeon and was paid the salary of a learner by UCDMC, characteristic of any training resident in any residency in America. That salary was just fine. How UCDMC was paid or how much payment was received was none of my business. In retrospect, I believe UCDMC was a feeding ground for the predatory Medi-Cal, as academic physicians and surgeons and university administrators do not appear to be very good at business.

When finishing my residency in general surgery I decided to remain in Sacramento and go to work in the private sector and obtained admitting and surgical privileges in the three downtown metropolitan hospitals.

A big feature of my early career was emergency surgery, and I frequented all three ER's. The ER doctors appreciated my availability, as many older and established private practice surgeons backed off as a ""rite of passage"" so they could get sleep at night and focus on their elective surgery cases. That meant more work (fun) for me, as I built my reputation and my business as most young surgeons who ventured out on their own did.

So, when I would operate on Medi-Cal patients, I was shocked to see just how cheap the Medi-Cal payment system was when I started to bill the government myself in this new private practice setting that itself was absorbing the burden of more and more Medi-Cal patients. No ER anywhere in the USA would turn away any patient seeking medical treatment. Compared to the private insurances, including Medicare, I was paid about 90 cents on a dollar while Medi-Cal paid about 30 cents on a dollar and that is not good business. It was and remains nonsense.

Just as bad, my ER doctor colleagues would introduce Medi-Cal patients when asking me to see them in the ER as ""Golden Bear"" because of the distinctive Medi-Cal insurance card displaying the state animal, the grizzly bear. Translated that means cheap or pathetic payment, and they would always apologize. They would describe insured patients as ""solid citizens."" Those older and more seasoned surgeons entering their rite of passage discussed above were also averse to working with Medi-Cal patients because of the annoyingly low payment for services rendered and were happy I was dealing with them.

One very important characteristic of Medi-Cal patients I dealt with in private practice that I didn't recognize as a resident at UCDMC was their lack of appreciation and friendliness. It didn't matter whether they were Caucasian, Mexican, Russian, Laotian, or otherwise. They were generally grumpy and unappreciative and entitled. Late in my career I complained to my office staff once after morning rounds in the hospital that even a simple ""thank you"" would be reasonable and considered thanking these patients in the future for letting me operate on them. That was a hugely different characteristic between Medi-Cal patients and other medical insurance patients, and the problem was and remains the responsibility of the administrators of Medi-Cal.

With time and abuse of both doctors and hospitals, Medi-Cal tragically expanded into all healthcare insurances in California such that by the turn of the century, government and closely allied healthcare insurance companies administered and still administer the payment of physicians at a rate of about 25 cents on a dollar. Californians were and remain clueless to this folly. That was when I had had enough and stopped practicing general surgery in Sacramento. Medi-Cal care gravitated to rock bottom and I blame Governor Gavin Newsom. The buck stops with Newsom.

The abusive and deleterious impact on California medicine via Medi-Cal is not simply financial. Bad feelings and outright prejudice between doctors and patients have been conjured up by those controlling the ""healthcare industry.""

It's not the patients' fault for the cheap payment of Medi-Cal health insurance and prejudice is not the fault of ""well off people"" in reducing Medi-Cal enrollees to the level of cheap, ungrateful scum.

It is Newsom's Medi-Cal, and he knows it and he owns it

Even worse, the sycophantic bureaucracy invaded UCDMC and indoctrinated medical and surgical academia, which is now completely on board with government run healthcare and this failing system is being taught to our young up and coming physicians. Doctors have become indentured servants. The camaraderie between myself as a graduate of UCDMC and my prior colleagues in the academic sector became strained because of envy and a desire to destroy private practice surgeons on their part. Prejudice ensued among doctors.

The enthusiasm of both doctors and patients is at an all-time low, and it is almost impossible for doctors to hide it. Burnout has killed the spirit of medicine. All healthcare insurance companies, including Medi-Cal and Medicare are wolves in sheep's clothing. They have cheated physicians and hospitals out of their due profit in assuming control of the administration of ""healthcare."" Then they point their finger at those they have conquered and cry out ""price gouging"" and demand ""price fixing"" for the unwary Californians, as disguised humanitarian saviors of society. They destroyed medical care and the providers of that medical care. The economic initiative of a physician is gone, and survival is paramount.

Concomitant with this outright abuse of the medical profession is horrible abuse of the patient. The healing initiative of innocent patients was systematically leached out by Medi-Cal, who has continued to remind patients that the doctors and hospitals are price gouging, but they don't include the price fixing they cruelly initiated years and years ago. They know the doctors won't speak up as they steal and boast that it is becoming harder and harder to put up with all the doctor theft. The simple question is....""Where is the money?"" The way the taxation system is supposed to work is that you declare your income to the government and pay your taxes, but the way this system works is that the government steals your profit and taxes the doctors for the money they ripped off. Where does that leave the patient?

Malpractice litigation skyrocketed. The safety issue was pushed by the government. A medical malpractice suit is a loser for a physician. A cutthroat ambulance chasing plaintiff attorney and his highly compensated expert witness doctor with a great niche, along with a sympathetic lay jury and an activist judge is a formidable adversary for a doctor. The government cries out, ""Doctors are unsafe! Hospitals are unsafe!"" Ironically, the government is absolutely correct, but they blame the very people they cheated, including the patients.

The result? A massive decrease in the standard of medical and surgical care, a paucity of attention to detail, gross negligence, prejudice, replacement of doctors by healthcare providers such as nurse ""practitioners"" and ""physician assistants"", flat-out danger, and literal death of patients on a large scale.

The latest chapter of Newsom's Medi-Cal strategy has greatly influenced the rookies in Washington, D.C. in the form of the PPACA or the ""patient protection and affordable care act"", now the law of the land. The hypocrisy in that law described in those five words is stunning. If Medi-Cal were forced to tell the truth, it would shout out:

""I'm cheap and I'm cheating your doctors out of the money due them.

I am forcing you to hate doctors and for doctors to hate you.

I am now powerful and wealthy and in control of all of you.

I own you, and yes I owe you.

What are you going to do about it?

Whether you live or die is my decision.

Don't even think about trying to stop me!""

A new study from researchers at the University of Louisville found a tangible link between physical health and living near ""an abundance of green vegetation,"" per a university report about the study.

The study, published in the American Journal of Physiology and titled ""Residential proximity to greenness mitigates the hemodynamic effects of ambient air pollution,"" looked at the link between vascular (blood vessel) health, green spaces, and air pollution.

By cross-referencing study participants' health data with their residential addresses and data from the U.S. Geological Survey and local Environmental Protection Agency monitoring stations, the researchers found that ""residential proximity to greenness is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.""

In other words, living in areas with a lot of trees and other vegetation correlates with a healthier heart.

""These findings indicate that living in green areas may be conducive for vascular health and that the [favorable] effects of greenness may be attributable, in part, to attenuated exposure to air pollutants such as [particulate matter] and ozone,"" said Daniel Riggs, one of the study's authors.

Though this study focused specifically on cardiovascular health, it is far from the first research to draw a connection between health and proximity to green spaces.

Another study found that people living in areas with more greenery had longer telomeres, chromosome structures that are a marker of cellular health. Another found that living near a park increased peoples' mental health. And another determined that the number of trees in your area could have a big effect on heat-related health problems.

""Although we have known for a long time that exposure to air pollution has adverse effects on our blood vessels, this study shows that those who live in greener neighborhoods may be less affected,"" said Aruni Bhatnagar, the professor who led the research. ""Therefore, one way of preventing the harmful health effects of air pollution may be to make neighborhoods more green.""",thecooldown.com,news,The Cool Down,Jeremiah Budin,-0.003921568627450966,448972693,1,https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/zbKKxxqnZAmz.jpg,

An Irish aid worker living in Malawi has said that climate change is posing an ""existential threat"" that could leave parts of the country uninhabitable if temperatures keep rising.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no. Sometimes it's our handwork which brings us such changes, and we are not even prepared for such changes, yet it's our own handwork.",irishnews.com,news,The Irish News,,-0.1215686274509804,448972616,1,https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/PBXEIRQQYVNXBMFZFPHKEFQMVE.jpg?smart=true&auth=11173fe778c2c56e409c6961cfe6116f28f61767a2920d6039ca791ef76b90cf&width=1200&height=630,

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing.

The first Cùra Guardian roadshow event will take place at The Macphail Centre in Ullapool on Monday (March 25) at 2pm.

The event will be opened by Councillor Isabelle Campbell, a local ward representative.

Sitakumari, director and principal dancer/storyteller for Heartstone, will introduce the Cùra Guardian Gateway at www.curaguardian.com, followed by an online presentation from Arvind Paranjpye, the director of the Nehru Planetarium, a keen supporter of Cùra Guardian, currently assisting with bringing new partners from across India to the environmental initiative. He will join from Mumbai.

The welcome will include an address by the Highland Indian Association, Highland Multicultural Association and Edinburgh's Women's Interfaith Group, alongside Heartstone.

This is an innovative concept, created by Heartstone photographer/writer, Nick Sidle, which aims to shine a new light on the natural world through documentary, including spectacular images, latest scientific research highlighting the issues we are facing today, global cultural story and history intertwined.

It opens in Highland Scotland but then spreads out to make connections with cultures across the world.

It's described as a visually stunning and entertaining route into the environment, which is also insightful and powerful, connecting people and the world that surrounds them. Heartstone is a Highland-based non-profit organisation which produces story - literature, photodocumentary, history - presented through exhibitions, events, performances, publication and online.

In the second half of the event, Sitakumari and will be joined by young Ullapool dancers in supporting roles to present a dance-drama drawn from one of the stories on Cùra Guardian, 'In the Beat of a Dragonfly's Heart' .This story can be accessed from the link below: https://curaguardian.exposure.co/in-the-beat-of-a-dragonflys-heart

The Southern Hawker Dragonfly is important as a climate change marker. It is now being seen regularly in the Highlands, previously only recorded much further south, demonstrating the climate really is changing as evidenced by the presence of new species such as this.

An exhibition of some of the breathtaking images on Cùra Guardian, including those of the Southern Hawker, which inspired the choreography for the dance-drama, is on display at the centre.

Heartstone has acknowledged funding and support from NatureScot and The Pebble Trust for the website development and staging of this event. Sitakumari said: ""We are also grateful for the support of High Life Highland and Ullapool High School for their support, including locating the Ullapool dancers and local volunteers who have made this event possible.""

Cùra is a character from the book Heartstone was founded from, 'The Heartstone Odyssey'. He is a badger and his name in Gaelic means 'protector' or 'guardian'. In the story, his role is that of a protector of place and home, both social and the natural world, and he has a strong Highland historical connection, a story for children which is also capturing the hearts and minds of adults.

Sitakumari explained: ""One of the aspects of the Cùra project which makes it stand out as a unique concept, is the connection which is being made through it with indigenous communities across the world. The partners currently include Canada, USA, Colombia, Peru, Kenya, India and the Pacific Islands and more are being added with time. These communities are sharing their own cultural stories for Cùra Guardian which demonstrate the connection they have had with the environment which surrounds them over millennia and which has shaped their worlds, as well as raising some of the issues they face now.

""These connections have been made possible through a photolibrary of over 2m images which, alongside the Cùra story, provides the starting point for the entire project. Built over a period of 30 years, this is the work of Highlands-based photographer, Nick Sidle, Heartstone's photographer and writer and the man who created the Cùra concept. Many of the images have been gathered with special access from environmental partners within Scotland and globally and the library is still growing. The environmental part of Nick's photolibrary includes plants, animals and habitats which bring Cùra's world in the Highlands to life. In this project, it has a further role - it provides the mechanism through which the global connections are being made.""

Heartstone stories aim to bring people together across all cultures and backgrounds, to see a common human experience. Encompassing both social and environmental themes and designed to reach all age groups, this is a new route to get closer to and be inspired by the world which surrounds us all, to see what may be familiar with new eyes.",ross-shirejournal.co.uk,news,RossShire Journal,,0.3960784313725489,448972595,1,https://www.ross-shirejournal.co.uk/_media/img/2Y464Z5ETD5NVBB94E5W.jpg,

We explain.

Joyce Blankenship, an 83-year-old grandmother of four, died inside her home in February when a single brush fire exploded in size in just 24 hours, racing across the landscape, burning her home and others in Stinnett, Texas.

Fueled by 50-60 mph winds and dry grasses, the fire grew so fast that it surrounded the truck of Cindy Owen, 44, where she was working more than 40 miles east of Blankenship's home. Owen was burned and died of her injuries two days later.

Dubbed the Smokehouse Creek fire, it burned across 850,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle in about 48 hours, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle as firefighters from throughout the region battled to save homes and lives.

It would be safer for firefighters, communities and property if such massive infernos were rare, but experts say these big fires are growing even bigger and more dangerous.

""We can expect to see larger wildfires in the future,"" said Seth McGinnis, associate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

Such huge fires, whether ignited by natural or human causes, are fanned by factors that include the expansion of suburbia into wildlands, land management and firefighting challenges and climate change, said McGinnis and others.

While the 10-year average number of wildfires in the nation each year dropped by around 20% over the past 20 years, the average number of acres burned is up by nearly 50%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.

Just as the rain and snow in a passing cold front ultimately helped cool down the Smokehouse Fire, the size of a wildfire is related to the duration of fire weather, McGinnis said. ""Climate change is projected to increase the amount of time when high fire conditions prevail in the U.S.""

The time is coming for a reckoning and more support of firefighting efforts, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association.

""People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire,"" Steinberg said ""There's so much denial.""

Smokehouse Creek Fire one of the biggest in history

Anytime a large blaze makes headlines, people tend to compare the fire to ones of the past, but the world of fire statistics is ""wacky and murky,"" said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and an author of several books on fire history. Quantifying fires that happened more than a century ago can be ""a slippery concept,"" Pyne said.

Using information provided by Pyne and Birgitte Messerschmidt, director of research at the fire protection association, USA TODAY put together a list of the known wildfires or wildfire complexes (groups of fires) with an estimated size of at least 500,000 acres, dating back to 1825. The list came from historical documents, state agency lists, the National Interagency Fire Center and the Western Fire Chiefs Association.

Among all those big fire complexes in history, the Smokehouse Creek Fire ranks eighth largest overall. On a list that includes only fires of at least 500,000 acres since the 1960s, when accuracy started to increase as foresters began measuring burned areas by aircraft, the Smokehouse Creek fire is the largest single fire. Only the Taylor Complex Fire in Alaska in 2004 is larger, at 1.3 million acres.

Nearly half the biggest wildfires occurred in Alaska, including seven in just the past 21 years.

Climate change is causing concern

""Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,"" the latest National Climate Assessment reported last year. These fires have ""significant public health, socioeconomic, and ecological implications for the nation,"" the assessment reported.

Warmer temperatures create the kind of conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment stated.

A 2016 study, led by John Abatzoglou, concluded human-caused climate change ""doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984"" in the western U.S. In other research, Abatzoglou documented trends in warming overnight temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.

Fire scientists are working to tease apart the factors influencing large fires, to learn more about the role of climate change, land management and other human influences, McGinnis said. He points out that while climate change is ""almost certainly a factor,"" human activity is responsible for a lot of fire ignitions.

McGinnis is part of a National Science Foundation University of Washington-based research team studying the effects of climate change and how simultaneous large wildfires might affect firefighting.

The research team includes these findings:

Jon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said it's important to remember climate change isn't solely to blame for the increase in large fires.

""It's much more complex than that,"" Keeley said. As the historical lists show, there have been large fires during droughts of the past.

In California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said, and don't appear to be affected by climate change at present. Climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the southern, he said.

Preparing for wildfires

Just because a fire is big doesn't mean it's bad, said the fire protection association's Steinberg. Big fires historically were a natural function, to clean the forest floor, put nutrients back into the soil and promote wildflower blooming, all part of healthy ecosystems adapted to fire over thousands of years. Indigenous peoples also used fire to maintain healthy habitats.

The problem arises when houses are in the way.

""When we talk about the rise of wildfire disasters, by that I mean homes and neighborhoods being obliterated by fire,"" Steinberg said. ""We've got fire on the landscape and then we've got all this built environment, frankly in the way, and it's largely not designed to withstand anything like the impacts we're seeing.""

On top of those concerns, Steinberg said fire departments are concerned about their ability to safely fight the large, dangerous blazes, especially in situations like Texas when several large wildfires all pop up in the same region at the same time.

Every five years, the association surveys firefighters about the needs of the 26,000 or so fire departments across the nation. Many are largely staffed by volunteers, and Steinberg said about two-thirds say they lack training and/or personal protective equipment and gear to fight fires safely and successfully.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no. Sometimes it's our handwork which brings us such changes, and we are not even prepared for such changes, yet it's our own handwork.",echolive.ie,news,Echo Live,,-0.1137254901960785,448972478,1,https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8078/4039012_1_seoimageog_07e25459-4bdd-4899-b602-5f00cac87d70-e1711274940843.jpg,

Inna Braverman, Co-Founder & CEO of Eco Wave Power Ltd., will be one of the speakers at the event, which will be held on March 27, 2024, at the Google for Startup Campus in Tel Aviv.

How do you believe women's voices and contributions can be pivotal in shaping a more inclusive and equitable society, particularly in male-dominated industries like tech?

As a woman who has navigated through the male-dominated energy industry, I firmly believe that women's voices and contributions are not just pivotal but essential in shaping a more inclusive and equitable society, especially in fields like tech. Diversity in perspectives leads to innovation, and when women are empowered to bring their unique insights and skills to the table, we not only enhance the quality of decision-making but also create more sustainable and impactful solutions. By fostering an environment where women are encouraged to participate and lead, we can break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and pave the way for a future where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive.

As we commemorate Women's Month, could you share a personal experience or story highlighting the impact of women's leadership and innovation in your field and how it has contributed to positive change?

I always say that being an entrepreneur is hard, but being a female entrepreneur adds an additional layer of difficulty. This is even more so in male-dominated industries like the energy industry. According to a recent study by Ernst & Young, only 5% of the executives in the global energy industry are women. This fact speaks for itself.

When I co-founded Eco Wave Power, I was 24 years old. When I entered a conference room, all excited to present EWP's pioneering wave energy technology, the men in the meeting often asked me for coffee, as they were sure I was someone's assistant.

Today, Eco Wave Power is a leading onshore wave energy company publicly traded on Nasdaq US under the symbol WAVE. We have become the first company in Israel to connect wave energy to the national electrical grid. We will soon commence installation of our first wave energy array in the United States, in the port of Los Angeles. Eco Wave Power has secured licensing for the first 1 MW to construct a commercial-scale wave power station in Portos, Portugal. In addition, the company holds more than 400 MW in its project pipeline.

As we celebrate Women's Month, I'm reminded of the countless women who continue to defy expectations, break barriers, and drive innovation in their respective fields. Their contributions inspire me personally and serve as a testament to women's limitless potential in creating a better, more equitable world.

The aftermath of tragic events like October 7 often calls for introspection and action. How can we leverage technology and innovation at this time? And what role can women leaders play in driving this change?

The tragedy that transpired on October 7 was unprecedented. Our hearts are broken. During these hard times, it is crucial for us to take action. Innovation in Israel isn't just a product of individual ambition - it's a collective journey fueled by a synergy of diverse talents and perspectives. Here, collaboration knows no boundary, as entrepreneurs, scientists, and visionaries come together to tackle the world's most pressing challenges.

The role of women leaders in fighting these challenges cannot be overstated. Women bring unique perspectives and problem-solving approaches to the table, which are essential in developing holistic solutions to complex challenges. By advocating for inclusive and ethical tech solutions, promoting diversity in STEM fields, and fostering collaboration across sectors, women leaders can play a pivotal role in building more resilient and sustainable communities in the face of adversity.

Women continue to face barriers and biases in the workplace. What strategies or initiatives have you found effective in breaking through these barriers, and what advice would you give to other women aspiring to leadership roles in your industry?

I established Eco Wave Power when I was only 24. While stepping into this industry with no access to funds and no network was scary, my message is that passion always prevails. Even in the most challenging times, when I was not taken seriously as a young woman, I kept going and did not give up.

In terms of advice for other women aspiring to leadership roles in my industry, I would emphasize the importance of resilience and persistence. There will inevitably be setbacks and obstacles, but don't let them stop you from pursuing your goals. Instead, view them as learning experiences and opportunities for growth. Surround yourself with a supportive network of peers and mentors who have faith in your capabilities and can offer guidance and encouragement.

As we strive for progress and empowerment, collaboration and solidarity are crucial. How do you envision fostering a supportive environment that uplifts and amplifies women's voices within your industry and beyond?

As the CEO and founder of EWP, I lead a strategy of inclusion and equality in every subsidiary of Eco Wave Power. I strive to create critical roles for women in this innovative industry. In addition, I invest significant efforts and resources to foster a more gender-diverse workplace. The company seeks out suitable female employees to ensure that women have a seat at the table in decision-making.

Furthermore, I mentor several female interns each year from leading universities worldwide and assist them with developing the skills and tools necessary to succeed as future female entrepreneurs. Equal representation for women is crucial for innovation in the energy field and for creating a more sustainable and prosperous planet.

I believe that I am a strong role model who can inspire other women to become innovators because I established Eco Wave Power at a very young age without contacts in the energy field or access to funding. I have always said that passion is the greatest renewable energy source.

Nowadays, I make significant efforts to inspire future female entrepreneurs by giving inspirational speeches about female entrepreneurship, sharing my personal experiences, and stressing the need not to give up, even if you are the only woman in the room.

Green, 30, is a familiar face, having logged 113 games in Chicago over the last three seasons. He was a crucial contributor over that time, but a right knee injury in 2022-23 limited him to only 32 games.

Saturday night's matchup against the Boston Celtics marked his return to the Bulls and the NBA.

But the real reunion happened two weeks ago in San Francisco after a game against the Golden State Warriors.

Green spent the last two months playing with Santa Cruz, the Warriors' G League affiliate. So it was a natural decision to attend the March 7 game when the Bulls visited the Warriors.

""I just felt the love,"" Green said.

Barely two weeks later, Green received a call from the Bulls about coming back to Chicago on the short-term deal.

It has been more than a year since Green played in an NBA game. He underwent an arthroscopic debridement in his right knee in January 2023, then played roughly 30 minutes over four games scattered from March 20 to April 7.

The firm was to deliver all the buses, and set up necessary charging facilities by December 2023.

Around 80 electric air-conditioned buses are currently lying unused due to a lack of charging points in city. Apart from leaving commuters to travel in run-down, non-AC buses, this is also causing financial losses to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

The NMC pays INR 74.12/km for diesel-run standard buses, and INR 50.93/km for electric AC buses.

The 80 buses are part of the 144 electric AC buses procured through PMI Electro Mobility Solutions Private Limited, a Haryana-based company, from funds released by state govt's 15th Finance Commission. The firm was to deliver all the buses, and set up necessary charging facilities by December 2023.

""It has been over a month since these buses are lying unused,"" admitted a senior official from NMC's transport department. The official said the firm is developing a depot in Wathoda area of south Nagpur.

Sources, however, pointed out that it will take a couple of months for the depot to become operational. Until then, the firm will not be able to roll out all the AC buses on city roads. The official added that the firm is set to complete the delivery of the remaining buses soon.

Another official said that the registration of many buses supplied by PMI is still not complete. This is also one of the reasons behind the buses lying unused.

The Haryana-based PMI not only failed to deliver the buses but also set up charging stations on time. Till date, the firm has delivered 109 buses, of which 80 are lying unused for lack of charging facilities. Sources said that PMI has not set up even a single charging station so far. Also, it is yet to deliver the remaining 35 buses.

As per contract, PMI is to install 22 charging points at Wathoda depot and six at Mor Bhavan bus stand. Of the 109 AC e-buses delivered by PMI, only 29 are in operation thanks to four charging points at Lakadganj set up by EVEYTRANS, another private firm engaged by NMC.

The buses provided by EVEYTRANS are charged at Wadi depot where it has set up 20 charging points. The 40 air-conditioned electric buses provided by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) are charged at its Hingna depot that has 15 charging points. The existing charging points are insufficient against the fleet of 195 electric buses, a source said.

NMC has a fleet of 627 Aapli Buses, of which it operates around 420 on over 100 routes. The fleet has around 237 standard buses, which will go off-road this year. Of the standard buses, the NMC had already scrapped 77 buses.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,-0.1686274509803921,448972233,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108749382,imgsize-26222,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/commercial-vehicle/charging-infrastructure-not-in-place-nmcs-80-ac-e-buses-gathering-dust.jpg",eng-9417938

In her new book, Cannibal Capitalism (2023), Nancy Fraser connects the climate and ecological crises to a contemporary crisis of care. Both, she argues, are rooted in a voracious form of capitalism that consumes the resources upon which our lives depend. This Special Issue seeks to build on a wave of recent writing that explores care as a valuable concept for the environmental humanities. 'What', Maria Puig de la Bellacasa asks, 'does caring mean when we go about thinking and living interdependently with beings other than human, in ""more than human"" worlds?' (13). Care is, Thom Van Dooren argues, 'a vital concept for an engaged environmental humanities' but 'much more needs to be done to articulate what different kinds of careful scholarship might look like' (294). We invite articles that engage with any aspect of the environmental humanities and take up this challenge of 'thinking with care' (Puig de la Bellacasa 13). We are interested in questions of interdependence and intersectionality, and approaches which expand definitions of care including ecofeminism, queer and Black ecologies, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives. Interdisciplinary approaches are also welcome, including articles which engage with diverse cultural forms, such as literature, life writing, film, art and other media, and consider how scholarship might itself be considered an act of care.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

If not corrected, severe MR may cause left and right ventricular heart failure. Mitral valve (MV) repair is the gold standard for treatment of MR. All repair techniques include MV annuloplasty, but various techniques are employed to repair the valvular apparatus. The classical technique of leaflet resection is associated with excellent results, but repair using artificial chordae is gaining popularity and has been shown to achieve similar results.Aims (1) Does MV repair with artificial chordae correct the morphology and function of the MV better than leaflet resection? (2) How common are MR at rest and systolic anterior motion (SAM) when these techniques are comparedat rest and during physical exercise? (3) To what extent is the right ventricular function restored in patients with chronic MR after MV repair? (4) Is MV repair preferable for the surgical treatment of MV infective endocarditis?Methods Study I: Retrospective study conducted in two centers that compares the results of MV repair using two different surgical techniques.Studies II and III: Prospective studies of resting and exercise echocardiography in patients that had undergone MV repair with either artificial chordae or leaflet resection. Study III compares the hemodynamics and left ventricularfunction of the repaired MV. Study IV evaluates the right ventricular function at rest and during exercise.IV: Retrospective study of long term outcomes of patients with MV infective endocarditis (IE) who underwent surgical repair in Lund with different surgical techniques.Results and importanceI: Both evaluated techniques for repair the MV were associated with good long-term survival and low incidence of recurrent MR, reoperation, IE and thromboembolism. No significant differences were detected between the groups.II: Both surgical techniques were associated with low pressure gradients over the MV at rest and during exercise without any significant difference between the groups. The left ventricular function was well preserved and both groups had good exercise capacity.III: At follow up, patients who underwent mitral valve repair had significantly worse RV function at rest and peak exercise than did healthy individuals.IV: Mortality following surgery for mitral IE is high. Independent predictors of poor outcome are the preoperative symptoms of persisting fever, clinical stroke and heart failure and infection with S. aureus, diabetes mellitus, renalfailure and age. The surgical method (i.e. repair or prosthesis implantation) did not influence survival of IE.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2156862745098038,448972119,1,,

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no. Sometimes it's our handwork which brings us such changes, and we are not even prepared for such changes, yet it's our own handwork.",longfordleader.ie,news,Longford Leader,,-0.1137254901960785,448972114,1,https://www.longfordleader.ie/resizer/1200/700/true/pa/2024_03_24/1711274707780_0.jpg--.jpg?1711274710276,

In her new book, Cannibal Capitalism (2023), Nancy Fraser connects the climate and ecological crises to a contemporary crisis of care. Both, she argues, are rooted in a voracious form of capitalism that consumes the resources upon which our lives depend. This Special Issue seeks to build on a wave of recent writing that explores care as a valuable concept for the environmental humanities. 'What', Maria Puig de la Bellacasa asks, 'does caring mean when we go about thinking and living interdependently with beings other than human, in ""more than human"" worlds?' (13). Care is, Thom Van Dooren argues, 'a vital concept for an engaged environmental humanities' but 'much more needs to be done to articulate what different kinds of careful scholarship might look like' (294). We invite articles that engage with any aspect of the environmental humanities and take up this challenge of 'thinking with care' (Puig de la Bellacasa 13). We are interested in questions of interdependence and intersectionality, and approaches which expand definitions of care including ecofeminism, queer and Black ecologies, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives. Interdisciplinary approaches are also welcome, including articles which engage with diverse cultural forms, such as literature, life writing, film, art and other media, and consider how scholarship might itself be considered an act of care.

Fueled by 50-60 mph winds and dry grasses, the fire grew so fast that it surrounded the truck of Cindy Owen, 44, where she was working more than 40 miles east of Blankenship's home. Owen was burned and died of her injuries two days later.

Dubbed the Smokehouse Creek fire, it burned across 850,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle in about 48 hours, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle as firefighters from throughout the region battled to save homes and lives.

It would be safer for firefighters, communities and property if such massive infernos were rare, but experts say these big fires are growing even bigger and more dangerous.

""We can expect to see larger wildfires in the future,"" said Seth McGinnis, associate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

Such huge fires, whether ignited by natural or human causes, are fanned by factors that include the expansion of suburbia into wildlands, land management and firefighting challenges and climate change, said McGinnis and others.

While the 10-year average number of wildfires in the nation each year dropped by around 20% over the past 20 years, the average number of acres burned is up by nearly 50%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.

Just as the rain and snow in a passing cold front ultimately helped cool down the Smokehouse Fire, the size of a wildfire is related to the duration of fire weather, McGinnis said. ""Climate change is projected to increase the amount of time when high fire conditions prevail in the U.S.""

The time is coming for a reckoning and more support of firefighting efforts, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association.

""People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire,"" Steinberg said ""There's so much denial.""

Anytime a large blaze makes headlines, people tend to compare the fire to ones of the past, but the world of fire statistics is ""wacky and murky,"" said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and an author of several books on fire history. Quantifying fires that happened more than a century ago can be ""a slippery concept,"" Pyne said.

Using information provided by Pyne and Birgitte Messerschmidt, director of research at the fire protection association, USA TODAY put together a list of the known wildfires or wildfire complexes (groups of fires) with an estimated size of at least 500,000 acres, dating back to 1825. The list came from historical documents, state agency lists, the National Interagency Fire Center and the Western Fire Chiefs Association.

Among all those big fire complexes in history, the Smokehouse Creek Fire ranks eighth largest overall. On a list that includes only fires of at least 500,000 acres since the 1960s, when accuracy started to increase as foresters began measuring burned areas by aircraft, the Smokehouse Creek fire is the largest single fire. Only the Taylor Complex Fire in Alaska in 2004 is larger, at 1.3 million acres.

Nearly half the biggest wildfires occurred in Alaska, including seven in just the past 21 years.

""Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,"" the latest National Climate Assessment reported last year. These fires have ""significant public health, socioeconomic, and ecological implications for the nation,"" the assessment reported.

Warmer temperatures create the kind of conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment stated.

A 2016 study, led by John Abatzoglou, concluded human-caused climate change ""doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984"" in the western U.S. In other research, Abatzoglou documented trends in warming overnight temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.

Fire scientists are working to tease apart the factors influencing large fires, to learn more about the role of climate change, land management and other human influences, McGinnis said. He points out that while climate change is ""almost certainly a factor,"" human activity is responsible for a lot of fire ignitions.

McGinnis is part of a National Science Foundation University of Washington-based research team studying the effects of climate change and how simultaneous large wildfires might affect firefighting.

The research team includes these findings:

Jon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said it's important to remember climate change isn't solely to blame for the increase in large fires.

""It's much more complex than that,"" Keeley said. As the historical lists show, there have been large fires during droughts of the past.

In California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said, and don't appear to be affected by climate change at present. Climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the southern, he said.

Just because a fire is big doesn't mean it's bad, said the fire protection association's Steinberg. Big fires historically were a natural function, to clean the forest floor, put nutrients back into the soil and promote wildflower blooming, all part of healthy ecosystems adapted to fire over thousands of years. Indigenous peoples also used fire to maintain healthy habitats.

The problem arises when houses are in the way.

""When we talk about the rise of wildfire disasters, by that I mean homes and neighborhoods being obliterated by fire,"" Steinberg said. ""We've got fire on the landscape and then we've got all this built environment, frankly in the way, and it's largely not designed to withstand anything like the impacts we're seeing.""

On top of those concerns, Steinberg said fire departments are concerned about their ability to safely fight the large, dangerous blazes, especially in situations like Texas when several large wildfires all pop up in the same region at the same time.

Every five years, the association surveys firefighters about the needs of the 26,000 or so fire departments across the nation. Many are largely staffed by volunteers, and Steinberg said about two-thirds say they lack training and/or personal protective equipment and gear to fight fires safely and successfully.

""That's a terrifying proportion, that we're putting the firefighters lives on the line,"" she said. ""There's a very huge lack of recognition of that problem and it's only going to continue.""

Having assumed the role of Executive Director in 2015 until October 2023, Professor Qamar spearheaded a transformative journey at NICVD, elevating it to one of the foremost cardiac hospitals globally. Under his visionary guidance and with the steadfast support of the Sindh government, NICVD became a beacon of hope for cardiac patients across the country.

Among his notable achievements, Professor Qamar initiated the pivotal step of offering free-of-cost treatment at NICVD since 2017, ensuring accessibility to cardiac care for all, regardless of financial constraints. His unwavering commitment to innovation led to the establishment of NICVD Karachi as the world's largest center for Primary angioplasty and the introduction of stroke intervention program, previously unprecedented in public sector hospitals.

Furthermore, Professor Qamar prioritized the enhancement of pediatric treatment and cardiac procedures, empowering NICVD to deliver comprehensive healthcare solutions.

His efforts also extended to education and capacity building, with over 1200 fellows trained under his mentorship, thus fortifying the cardiac workforce for the future.

Recognizing the plight of cardiac patients in rural areas, Professor Qamar initiated the establishment of cardiac satellite centers across Sindh Province in collaboration with the Sindh government. To date, 10 full-fledged hospitals have been established, bringing cardiac treatment to patients' doorsteps, thereby reducing the need for arduous journeys to major cities and preventing countless fatalities.

Another groundbreaking initiative introduced by Professor Qamar is the implementation of Chest Pain Units across Sindh Province, a first-of-its-kind program globally. With 28 units now operational, these facilities have been instrumental in saving over 32,000 lives by providing timely intervention and care.

The recognition of Professor Nadeem Qamar with the Pakistan Civil Award Tamgha-e-Imtiaz stands as a testament to his visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to public service, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of healthcare in Pakistan.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

Investments in India: India's economic landscape is rapidly evolving, with key policy changes and infrastructural advancements positioning the nation as an appealing investment hub, particularly in the financial technology sector. Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the World Economic Forum (WEF), stressed the significant role played by recent legislative reforms such as the bankruptcy law and taxation code, coupled with the development of the digital public infrastructure (DPI), in attracting investors to India.

In an interview with PTI, Blake highlighted India's exceptional performance in global markets, underscoring the profitability experienced by investors in the country. He noted that the proactive policy measures, notably the bankruptcy law and taxation code revisions, have fostered a conducive environment for investment, particularly in the burgeoning financial technology sector. The robust digital public infrastructure further solidifies India's position as a leading global market, with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a pivotal tool for enhancing personalisation and customisation within the industry.

AI is identified as a major driving force by 70 per cent of fintech CEOs surveyed by the WEF-Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, signalling its potential for revolutionising product and service offerings. Blake stressed the importance of AI adoption by sectoral regulators, particularly in the realm of risk management, emphasising the necessity for regulatory frameworks to evolve in tandem with technological advancements.

Acknowledging the proficiency of regulatory agencies in the Asia-Pacific region, Blake stressed the importance of knowledge exchange and collaboration to further enhance regulatory capabilities globally. He highlighted ongoing efforts to facilitate dialogue between financial service industry leaders and regulatory bodies to promote mutual understanding and alignment of objectives.

The WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth' echoed the sentiments of industry players, with a majority expressing confidence in the regulatory environment. Notably, 38 per cent of surveyed fintech companies cited regulatory support as a key factor contributing to their operational success and growth.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently witnessed its largest surge in dormant tokens being traded in over two years. This significant uptick in activity involves Bitcoin tokens that have not been moved for an extended period suddenly changing hands, which analysts believe could soon be a precursor to increased price volatility.

Crypto analyst Ali pointed out in a new tweet that Bitcoin has just witnessed its biggest surge in dormant BTC tokens changing hands in more than two years.

Historically, such movements have been associated with large holders or ""whales,"" who hold large amounts of Bitcoin and can influence market dynamics due to the size of their transactions.

The surge in dormant BTC tokens changing hands might significantly affect Bitcoin's price. Historically, increased activity among dormant tokens has often preceded periods of heightened price volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

According to Ali, the increased surge in dormant BTC tokens being traded might signal a potential increase in price volatility ahead. The rationale is that large, sudden transactions can lead to a domino effect, impacting the supply-demand equilibrium and, consequently, the price.

In a separate tweet, Ali reported that over 25,000 Bitcoins, worth about $1.60 billion, were moved to accumulation addresses, the greatest influx to these BTC wallets this year and indicating increased whale activity.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $60,771 in the last week and is now trading at $64,809, with market observers expecting further volatility in the short term. Bitcoin has increased by roughly 128% year on year, while it is down 12.2% from its all-time high of $73,798 set on March 14.

According to Ali, critical Bitcoin support levels to watch include $61,100, $56,685 and $51,530. On the other hand, significant resistance points for BTC are $66,990 and $72,880.",u.today,news,u.today,Tomiwabold Olajide,-0.003921568627450966,448971961,1,https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2024-03/s1685.jpg,

New energy laws will force Michigan residents to pay the equivalent of almost two additional mortgage payments each year.

What will people get in return? An energy policy that will have no measurable impact on the climate and make electricity less reliable.

DTE and Consumers Energy, on the other hand, are poised to profit.

Last year, Michigan's legislature passed a package of laws in support of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's net-zero carbon emissions plan.

The new laws require Michigan to eliminate 100% of fossil-fuel-powered electricity generation by 2040 (given that what the law carves out as ""clean"" natural gas involves technology that has never been demonstrated). The laws also muddy regulatory criteria to include vaguely defined ""environmental justice"" concerns in approving utility plans and wipe out local communities' ability to stop the construction of new wind and solar facilities.

Who stands to benefit? Not the average Michigander; the laws will cost ratepayers between $1,500 and $2,746 in energy costs each year. Given that the average monthly mortgage payment in Michigan is $1,435, that's as much as an additional two full payments charged to each ratepayer.

Surely, the climate savings from these policies can justify such a cost? Projections based on the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan suggest this legislation would, at best, reduce global temperatures by a mere 1/1000th of a degree by 2100. It's difficult to see how this new energy policy will benefit future Michiganders, let alone current residents paying the costs.

It is the state's major utility companies, DTE and Consumers Energy, that will profit from these climate policies.

It may seem counterintuitive that climate policies will help big utilities. Aren't they the rear guard of the fossil fuel status quo?

It's not so simple.

Like many states, Michigan's large investor-owned electric utilities do not operate in a free market; they are state-backed monopolies for 90% of ratepayers. To manage the abuses that can come with monopolies, the Michigan Public Service Commission, or MPSC, regulates the prices/rates that the utilities may charge ratepayers. In place of a competitive market that determines prices, the state grants its utilities a regulated profit, the costs of which are passed on to the ratepayers.

That regulated profit comes in part from the guaranteed rate of return on the 'total value of a utility's assets (e.g. plant, equipment, working capital, and deductions for accumulated depreciation),"" also known as the ""rate base.""

That is to say, ""[t]he way for a vertically integrated utility to make more money [is]... to spend more money,"" explains grid expert Meredith Angwin in Shorting the Grid.

These perverse incentives make rebuilding the grid's electricity generation in the name of climate action and the energy transition a highly profitable venture. The less efficient, the better; after all, the more they spend, the more they make, and the more they are allowed (by the Public Service Commission) to charge ratepayers.

The public utility commissions are supposed to prevent this rate-of-return farming, to protect ratepayers from the utilities, but the new laws co-opt this function. The MPSC is now tasked with enforcing the administration's climate ideology.

Federal policy also makes wind turbines and solar arrays lucrative to power companies. Washington gives out subsidies at taxpayer expense, paying ""wind projects $26 for each MWh of electricity the facility produces,"" write Isaac Orr and Mitch Rolling.

On top of the federal preferences, renewables benefit power companies by being unreliable forms of electricity generation. They are intermittent and require backup generation and/or battery storage, both of which are costly. This means that the power companies get guaranteed profits from wind turbines and solar arrays as well as from the reliable power plants necessary to back them up.

Electric grid administrators have described the problems caused by wind and solar mandates and subsidies. Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner James Danly warns that ""FERC has allowed the markets to fall prey to the price-distorting and warping effects of subsidies and public policies that have driven the advancement of large quantities of intermittent renewable resources onto the electric system.""

""Controllable, dispatchable resources are being retired and replaced primarily with weather-dependent, non-dispatchable, and variable generation types to achieve carbon reduction goals,"" said Todd Ramey of the Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator (MISO), the transmissions operator under which most of Michigan falls, in congressional testimony late last year. ""These weather-dependent generators are increasing reliability risks.""

Danly and Ramey are far from the only ones sounding the alarm.

The quest to shoehorn wind and solar into the grid comes at a heavy cost to ratepayers. It delivers a more expensive and unreliable product while doing nothing to help the environment. Lawmakers who want the people of Michigan to have cheap and reliable electricity must give up on wind and solar mandates.",michigancapitolconfidential.com,news,Michigan Capitol Confidential,,0.2784313725490195,448971876,1,https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/stock/shutterstock-1708518919.jpg,

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

This proposed alignment was adopted after years of work by East-West Gateway, Bi-State Development Agency and city leaders to find the best, most cost-effective North-South connector.

It would feature 10 stations and an alignment that runs north to south along Natural Bridge Avenue -- from Grand Boulevard to Parnell Street -- and along Parnell Street/Jefferson Avenue from Natural Bridge Avenue to Chippewa Street. The line would also connect with the current MetroLink system.

The Green Line adheres to CMT's criteria for support as it has been designed to preserve and enhance existing neighborhoods, promote unity, achieve regional objectives, reinforce existing public and private investments, and provide improved transportation for residents.

The project also opens up future connections into North St. Louis County and supports the White House's Justice40 Initiative principles, which mandates that at least 40% of certain federal investment benefits flow to disadvantaged communities.

CMT leads efforts for an integrated, affordable and convenient public transportation system that drives economic growth to improve quality of life in the St. Louis region. This project will help meet these goals. It's time to move transit forward and the Green Line is the right choice.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

Milwaukee Brewers camp this spring, more than any other in recent memory, was highlighted by the team's vast array of prospects.

With a strong performance, Jackson Chourio made the opening-day roster while others such as Robert Gasser and Tyler Black weren't reassigned to minor-league camp until March 19.

Still others, such as Jeferson Quero, Brock Wilken and Jacob Misiorowski, showed they aren't all that far away from making an impact on the Brewers.

With that in mind, here is a list of 10 players - prospects and otherwise - who didn't make the final cut but are certain to appear on the major-league roster at some point early in the season.

Robert Gasser, LHP

He flashed his strikeout stuff and received a vote of confidence from manager Pat Murphy, who indicated with about two weeks of camp left that he'll be making his debut sometime in the first month.

Tyler Black, IF

The left-handed-hitting Canadian is a hard-charging competitor whose offensive tools and speed on the base paths help separate him. Black's defense needs work, however, with first base and third base his areas of focus.

Aaron Ashby, LHP

The Brewers want Ashby to continue stretching out, and since he's still not all the way back from 2023 shoulder surgery the best place for him to do that is at Class AAA Nashville. Best guess is we'll see him early on, like Gasser.

Christian Arroyo, INF

Arroyo is a six-year veteran of the major leagues who was in camp on a minor-league contract. He has versatility and some pop, meaning there will be a spot for him at some point this season with the Brewers.

Owen Miller, INF

Speaking of versatility, the Fredonia native has that in spades, with an ability to play first, second, third and the outfield. Miller has shown he can make an offensive impact as well. He's about as reliable as they come, which also has value.

Joey Wiemer, OF

Wiemer experienced major ups and downs as a rookie in 2023 and revamped his swing in the offseason to better equip him for success. In spring training, he looked like he needed more time to lock in at the plate, so he should log at-bats at Nashville.

JB Bukauskas, RHP

He joined the Brewers last April but barely pitched after being sidelined by a series of pesky injuries. Bukauskas showed the stuff this spring that drew Milwaukee to him, and with a rare fourth minor-league option he'll be in the bullpen mix.

Oliver Dunn, INF

A terrific 2023 earned him acclaim, and a 40-man roster crunch in Philadelphia paved his way to Milwaukee. He plays second and third, and his left-handed bat and developing pop help separate him a bit from some of the Brewers' other infielders.

Janson Junk, RHP

Junk's ability to start as well as provide length out of the bullpen figures to have him in the mix of pitchers who will see time this season in Milwaukee. He made one start for the Brewers in 2023, but spent the rest of the year at Nashville.

Carlos Rodríguez, RHP

Rodríguez didn't get many opportunities this spring, but the Brewers love his makeup and competitiveness. He makes up for a lack of nasty stuff with a true sense for how to get batters out and a six-pitch arsenal.

As for that talented next wave of Quero, Wilken and Misiorowski, Murphy is on record as saying all three could touch the majors at some point this season.

Wilken at third base and Misiorowski in the bullpen would appear to have the best opportunities, with Quero blocked behind the plate by a trio of proven major-leaguers.",greenbaypressgazette.com,news,Green Bay Press-Gazette,Green Bay Press-Gazette,0.2705882352941176,448971605,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/22/PMJS/73067861007-usatsi-22802543.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3991,2245,x504,y162&format=pjpg&width=1200",

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Media darlings, insane amounts of aura, always brilliant to watch - something's up and we've grown suspicious of it. What if - like in music - there were industry plant ballers, generated in a lab, nurtured by the footballing powers that be and dropped into our game without a trace to control the narrative? It's entirely possible.

At the expense of sounding a little too much like Matt Le Tissier, we've put together a list of footballers who simply feel too good to be true and are thus confirmed industry plants from above. Or is that what they want us to think?

Starting with the obvious choice, everybody knows the game is lacking superheroes to replace Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's as football's immortal juggernauts, transcending human abilities.

Ever since Endrick burst onto the scene at Palmeiras, the storyline has been perfect. Suspiciously perfect. There's not a single image of him that doesn't look iconic and he's already on a path to stardom from humble beginnings to teenage Galactico.

Ahead of joining Real Madrid in the summer of 2024, he's bagged on his debut for the Brazil national team at Wembley and become the youngest player to score for the Selecao since R9 in 1994. Combine the story with the iconic images, the popped collar and tucked shirt and the New Balance deal and it all becomes a little bit fishy.

He's the biggest industry plant of them all. Fans of Dune may even call him the Lisan al Gaib.

If you could generate the perfect deep-lying playmaker from the ground up in some sort of spooky, high-tech lab, Rodri would emerge from the smoke in the chamber at the end of the experiment.

He's got height, physicality, the mental temperament and the connection between brain and feet to sew it all together. He's genuinely flawless.

Combine those freakishly robotic performances with his ability to evade yellow cards and score absolute screamers exactly when Manchester City are under pressure, and it makes you think.

This is what the footballing gods wanted. They wanted a side to disrupt the traditional big clubs, so they dropped the Spaniard in at City, made him elite and made them the new face of the sport. It stinks.

We should've been onto Paolo from the moment he broke through, considering the success of his father Cesare.

The storylines are just too clean with those two. Captain, leader, legend at Milan through the 1960s before returning to manage the club later on, one of the godfathers of Italian football had his legacy succeeded by his son, who became arguably the greatest one club man in the history of the sport.

Someone had a hand in this. Between the outrageous ability on the pitch, the legacy at a footballing behemoth and Paolo's devilishly handsome looks, it's all too good to be true.

Giving 22-year-old Daniel Maldini industry plant treatment to secure the bloodline would've raised too much suspicion. It all makes sense.

In the genre of football heritage, it felt inevitable that Manchester United got in on the act and found themselves an industry plant.

Mainoo has been nothing short of sensational since bursting onto the scene under Erik ten Hag and the stars all seem to be aligning. A young lad from Stockport emerging in a time of need, fixing a position that's been an issue for as long as Paul Scholes has been retired, primed and ready to spark a revival under new owners.

The game needs a resurgent United and a young, local hero leading that resurgence is the icing on the cake. We've cracked the code.

We're all in agreement that Haaland is a complete and utter freak and quite possibly an alien, right? Good.

If we're talking about industry plants, Haaland simply has to be in the conversation. There has never been a more perfect and purpose-built forward.

Nobody would've suspected such an outrageous footballer to be Alfie Haaland's son, either. It's genius. They've plucked him at a young age, moulded him and thrown him into the game to write the script for the next generation of Messi vs Ronaldo alongside Mbappe - and Endrick, of course.

Not even peak Attitude Era WWE could've whipped up storylines like this. Rock vs Austin who?

Yeah, sorry, we're not buying it. It all seems too good to be true. Stick with us, here.

Germany have been a shambles ever since they became world champions in 2014 and have been unable to stop the haemorrhaging. So, what do you do? Easy - pick out a random German kid with the looks, summon the scriptwriters and cook up a redemption arc that will save lives and feed German football fans forever.

Wirtz burst onto the scene as a teenager, always looks iconic like Endrick does and battled adversity by recovering from an ACL tear already in his career, only to come back better and carry Bayer Leverkusen to a first-ever Bundesliga before carrying Germany on home soil at Euro 2024.

They called us mad, but it's right there for us all to see. Confirmed industry plant.

The debut at 16, the dream footballing pathway, the now-iconic celebration and championing the return of the adidas Predator, we're onto you Jude.

He's living out every football-obsessed child's wildest dreams and perhaps that isn't a coincidence. Football needed a new Zinedine Zidane, and the powers that be plucked out a boy from Birmingham to answer our prayers. Nobody suspected a thing. Genius.

We're finishing with football's failed industry plant. Morata has long been top of people's lists when it comes to football conspiracies and we're no different.

Emerging at Real Madrid, the Spanish striker has spent the best years of his career being thrown from top club to top club without ever really warranting it, playing twice at Real, Atletico Madrid and Juventus, with an inevitable spell at Chelsea in between.

Football tried its very best to force Morata down our throats and turn him into the game's next great striker, but it didn't pay off and now their secrets are out.

Milwaukee Brewers camp this spring, more than any other in recent memory, was highlighted by the team's vast array of prospects.

With a strong performance, Jackson Chourio made the opening-day roster while others such as Robert Gasser and Tyler Black weren't reassigned to minor-league camp until March 19.

Still others, such as Jeferson Quero, Brock Wilken and Jacob Misiorowski, showed they aren't all that far away from making an impact on the Brewers.

With that in mind, here is a list of 10 players - prospects and otherwise - who didn't make the final cut but are certain to appear on the major-league roster at some point early in the season.

Robert Gasser, LHP

He flashed his strikeout stuff and received a vote of confidence from manager Pat Murphy, who indicated with about two weeks of camp left that he'll be making his debut sometime in the first month.

Tyler Black, IF

The left-handed-hitting Canadian is a hard-charging competitor whose offensive tools and speed on the base paths help separate him. Black's defense needs work, however, with first base and third base his areas of focus.

Aaron Ashby, LHP

The Brewers want Ashby to continue stretching out, and since he's still not all the way back from 2023 shoulder surgery the best place for him to do that is at Class AAA Nashville. Best guess is we'll see him early on, like Gasser.

Christian Arroyo, INF

Arroyo is a six-year veteran of the major leagues who was in camp on a minor-league contract. He has versatility and some pop, meaning there will be a spot for him at some point this season with the Brewers.

Owen Miller, INF

Speaking of versatility, the Fredonia native has that in spades, with an ability to play first, second, third and the outfield. Miller has shown he can make an offensive impact as well. He's about as reliable as they come, which also has value.

Joey Wiemer, OF

Wiemer experienced major ups and downs as a rookie in 2023 and revamped his swing in the offseason to better equip him for success. In spring training, he looked like he needed more time to lock in at the plate, so he should log at-bats at Nashville.

JB Bukauskas, RHP

He joined the Brewers last April but barely pitched after being sidelined by a series of pesky injuries. Bukauskas showed the stuff this spring that drew Milwaukee to him, and with a rare fourth minor-league option he'll be in the bullpen mix.

Oliver Dunn, INF

A terrific 2023 earned him acclaim, and a 40-man roster crunch in Philadelphia paved his way to Milwaukee. He plays second and third, and his left-handed bat and developing pop help separate him a bit from some of the Brewers' other infielders.

Janson Junk, RHP

Junk's ability to start as well as provide length out of the bullpen figures to have him in the mix of pitchers who will see time this season in Milwaukee. He made one start for the Brewers in 2023, but spent the rest of the year at Nashville.

Carlos Rodríguez, RHP

Rodríguez didn't get many opportunities this spring, but the Brewers love his makeup and competitiveness. He makes up for a lack of nasty stuff with a true sense for how to get batters out and a six-pitch arsenal.

As for that talented next wave of Quero, Wilken and Misiorowski, Murphy is on record as saying all three could touch the majors at some point this season.

Wilken at third base and Misiorowski in the bullpen would appear to have the best opportunities, with Quero blocked behind the plate by a trio of proven major-leaguers.",postcrescent.com,news,The Post-Crescent,,0.2705882352941176,448971485,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/22/PMJS/73067861007-usatsi-22802543.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3991,2245,x504,y162&format=pjpg&width=1200",

The seventh-year veteran signed a 10-day contract Saturday as the team continues to struggle with depth following the season-ending injuries of Patrick Williams and Zach LaVine.

Green, 30, is a familiar face, having logged 113 games in Chicago over the last three seasons. He was a crucial contributor over that time, but a right knee injury in 2022-23 limited him to only 32 games.

Saturday night's matchup against the Boston Celtics marked his return to the Bulls and the NBA.

But the real reunion happened two weeks ago in San Francisco after a game against the Golden State Warriors.

Green spent the last two months playing with Santa Cruz, the Warriors' G League affiliate. So it was a natural decision to attend the March 7 game when the Bulls visited the Warriors.

Green waited outside the locker room for coach Billy Donovan, who wrapped him up in a hug upon seeing his former player.

Green's entry to the locker room that night was met with enthusiastic shouts as he greeted his former teammates.

""I just felt the love,"" Green said.

Barely two weeks later, Green received a call from the Bulls about coming back to Chicago on the short-term deal.

It has been more than a year since Green played in an NBA game. He underwent an arthroscopic debridement in his right knee in January 2023, then played roughly 30 minutes over four games scattered from March 20 to April 7.

Join us in this fight.

Russia launched a major missile and drone attack across Ukraine early on March 24, targeting critical infrastructure and leaving thousands without heating, local governors reported.

The Russian forces fired 29 cruise missiles and 28 Shahed drones in a large-scale attack targeting eight regions in the west, center, north, and south of Ukraine, the Air Force said. Of the total air targets fired across Ukraine, 18 cruise missiles and 25 Shahed drones were intercepted by the air defense, according to the report.

Kyiv was among Russia's targets. Approximately 10 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. Debris of the shot-down missiles fell on two districts, in the eastern and central parts of the capital, without major destruction on residential areas, it added.

Western Lviv Oblast was also struck in the mass strike. Russia attacked an unnamed critical infrastructure site in Lviv Oblast using missiles and drones, causing a fire at the site, regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi reported. He added that firefighters were working at the site, and there was no information on possible casualties as of 7:38 a.m. local time.

The Air Force branch in charge of Western Ukraine reported shooting down eight of the 19 cruise missiles fired, as well as all seven Shahed drones.

Russia once again targeted critical infrastructure during the second air raid alert that went off at around 9:30 a.m., a few hours after the countrywide strike overnight, attacking Lviv Oblast with Kinzhal air-launched missiles, according to Kozytskyi.

There are ""two hits"" recorded at the critical infrastructure site where the fire had erupted, but the firefighters who had been working after the major strike overnight were evacuated to a safe space on time, he added.

Central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast also suffered an attack on critical infrastructure.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported that the Russian attack drones targeted critical infrastructure in the city of Kryvyi Rih and in the Nikopol district.

In Kryvyi Rih, a city of around 600,000, the attack damaged heating networks and power lines, according to Lysak.

Six hospitals, more than 150 educational institutions, and 3,000 residential buildings home to 76,000 people were left without heating, he added. One of the medical facilities had briefly lost power.

In southern Odesa Oblast, the strike damaged a port infrastructure in the region, according to the Southern Defense Forces. The regional governor has not yet reported the destruction.

Kherson, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Volyn oblasts were other Ukrainian regions above which air targets were shot down, according to the Air Force.

Russian forces launched the latest mass strike from occupied Crimea and Russia, with cruise missiles being fired from 14 Tu-95 strategic bombers from around Engels in Russia's Saratov Oblast in the country's west, it added. The cruise missiles fired at Kyiv were launched from the north, according to local authorities.

Neighboring NATO member Poland said that a missile had once again briefly entered its airspace during the Russian attack.

One of the Russian cruise missiles targeting western Ukraine flew into Polish airspace for about 39 seconds at 4:23 a.m., Polish Air Force's Operational Command said on X.

""All necessary procedures aimed at ensuring the safety of Polish airspace have been activated, and the Operational Command of the Polish Air Force is monitoring the situation continuously,"" the Polish Armed Forces said.

Throughout the winter of 2022-2023, Russia launched a series of mass missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure facilities, killing dozens of civilians and causing rolling blackouts nationwide. That winter, Russia severely hit almost half of the country's energy system.

The winter of 2023-2024 spelled yet another wave of massive strikes, but the resulting energy disruptions have not reached the scale of those in late 2022 and early 2023.

There is a saying in Malawi that if children eat from the fig tree, their parents are the ones who will get sick.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

An Irish aid worker living in Malawi has said that climate change is posing an ""existential threat"" that could leave parts of the country uninhabitable if temperatures keep rising.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""But for me, no. Sometimes it's our handwork which brings us such changes, and we are not even prepared for such changes, yet it's our own handwork.",guernseypress.com,news,Guernsey Press,,-0.1607843137254902,448971393,1,https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/fNnXYTuqaxldsvHHZCbggv7PDAA=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/6MUPKZTHJRCZTPNHFOSJB6VQYE.jpg,

The Rockets' win streak is their longest since winning eight in a row in November 2019. Houston closed within 1 ½ games of idle Golden State for 10th place and the last play-in spot in the Western Conference.

""It won't really mean anything if we don't make the playoffs,"" Green said. ""That's the goal everyone has right now. I'm just trying to go out there and be the best version of myself for my teammates.""

Jabari Smith Jr. and Kris Dunn were ejected five seconds into the second quarter after both were assessed technical fouls for fighting. The two threw punches at each other after they got tangled up while the ball was being brought up the court. Players and officials got between them before the scuffle could escalate further.

Dunn said the two ""exchanged a couple words, a couple pushes and the next thing you know we're ejected.""

""For me, I take responsibility for my actions and whatever the league decides for me, I have to respect that,"" Dunn said of possible punishment.

Smith was not made available postgame.

Houston coach Ime Udoka said he thought the altercation was a carryover from when the teams played on Jan. 20 and both players got into it then and were issued technical fouls.

""I think Dunn hit him with a shot, and then, they got wrapped up and threw a few punches,"" Udoka said. ""Basically, nothing landed, but as soon as you throw a punch, you're going to be ejected.""

VanVleet scored 23 points on seven 3-pointers, and Green had 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting in the first half as the Rockets built an 85-55 halftime lead. Houston shot 65% in the first half and was 15 of 24 on 3s.

VanVleet tied James Harden and Chandler Parsons for the single-game franchise record for 3s. Green finished 15 of 22 from the field and was 7 of 11 on 3-pointers.

""I felt good after the first shot,"" VanVleet said. ""Got a couple more clean looks. When it's going in like that, and you get good looks, teammates find you in good spots. We got it going a little bit there, and we were trying to ride that wave a little there.""

Jeff Green scored a season-high 21 points, and Dillon Brooks added 12 points for Houston, which shot 56% for the game. The Rockets improved to 35-35, marking the first time they were at .500 since Jan. 13, when they were 19-19.

John Collins scored a season high-tying 25 points, and Collin Sexton added 20 points and eight assists for the Jazz, who tied a season high with their fifth straight loss.

Utah shot 45% but was 11 of 37 on 3-pointers.

""Credit to Houston, 27 3s is pretty outstanding,"" Utah coach Will Hardy said. ""A lot of those were deep. Fred's a hell of a player. Jalen's a hell of a player. They both got really hot.""

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

An Irish aid worker living in Malawi has said that climate change is posing an ""existential threat"" that could leave parts of the country uninhabitable if temperatures keep rising.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

With a strong performance, Jackson Chourio made the opening-day roster while others such as Robert Gasser and Tyler Black weren't reassigned to minor-league camp until March 19.

Still others, such as Jeferson Quero, Brock Wilken and Jacob Misiorowski, showed they aren't all that far away from making an impact on the Brewers.

With that in mind, here is a list of 10 players - prospects and otherwise - who didn't make the final cut but are certain to appear on the major-league roster at some point early in the season.

Robert Gasser, LHP

He flashed his strikeout stuff and received a vote of confidence from manager Pat Murphy, who indicated with about two weeks of camp left that he'll be making his debut sometime in the first month.

Tyler Black, IF

The left-handed-hitting Canadian is a hard-charging competitor whose offensive tools and speed on the base paths help separate him. Black's defense needs work, however, with first base and third base his areas of focus.

Aaron Ashby, LHP

The Brewers want Ashby to continue stretching out, and since he's still not all the way back from 2023 shoulder surgery the best place for him to do that is at Class AAA Nashville. Best guess is we'll see him early on, like Gasser.

Christian Arroyo, INF

Arroyo is a six-year veteran of the major leagues who was in camp on a minor-league contract. He has versatility and some pop, meaning there will be a spot for him at some point this season with the Brewers.

Owen Miller, INF

Speaking of versatility, the Fredonia native has that in spades, with an ability to play first, second, third and the outfield. Miller has shown he can make an offensive impact as well. He's about as reliable as they come, which also has value.

Joey Wiemer, OF

Wiemer experienced major ups and downs as a rookie in 2023 and revamped his swing in the offseason to better equip him for success. In spring training, he looked like he needed more time to lock in at the plate, so he should log at-bats at Nashville.

JB Bukauskas, RHP

He joined the Brewers last April but barely pitched after being sidelined by a series of pesky injuries. Bukauskas showed the stuff this spring that drew Milwaukee to him, and with a rare fourth minor-league option he'll be in the bullpen mix.

Oliver Dunn, INF

A terrific 2023 earned him acclaim, and a 40-man roster crunch in Philadelphia paved his way to Milwaukee. He plays second and third, and his left-handed bat and developing pop help separate him a bit from some of the Brewers' other infielders.

Janson Junk, RHP

Junk's ability to start as well as provide length out of the bullpen figures to have him in the mix of pitchers who will see time this season in Milwaukee. He made one start for the Brewers in 2023, but spent the rest of the year at Nashville.

Carlos Rodríguez, RHP

Rodríguez didn't get many opportunities this spring, but the Brewers love his makeup and competitiveness. He makes up for a lack of nasty stuff with a true sense for how to get batters out and a six-pitch arsenal.

As for that talented next wave of Quero, Wilken and Misiorowski, Murphy is on record as saying all three could touch the majors at some point this season.

Fueled by 50-60 mph winds and dry grasses, the fire grew so fast that it surrounded the truck of Cindy Owen, 44, where she was working more than 40 miles east of Blankenship's home. Owen was burned and died of her injuries two days later.

Dubbed the Smokehouse Creek fire, it burned across 850,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle in about 48 hours, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle as firefighters from throughout the region battled to save homes and lives.

It would be safer for firefighters, communities and property if such massive infernos were rare, but experts say these big fires are growing even bigger and more dangerous.

""We can expect to see larger wildfires in the future,"" said Seth McGinnis, associate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

Such huge fires, whether ignited by natural or human causes, are fanned by factors that include the expansion of suburbia into wildlands, land management and firefighting challenges and climate change, said McGinnis and others.

While the 10-year average number of wildfires in the nation each year dropped by around 20% over the past 20 years, the average number of acres burned is up by nearly 50%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.

Just as the rain and snow in a passing cold front ultimately helped cool down the Smokehouse Fire, the size of a wildfire is related to the duration of fire weather, McGinnis said. ""Climate change is projected to increase the amount of time when high fire conditions prevail in the U.S.""

The time is coming for a reckoning and more support of firefighting efforts, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association.

""People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire,"" Steinberg said ""There's so much denial.""

Anytime a large blaze makes headlines, people tend to compare the fire to ones of the past, but the world of fire statistics is ""wacky and murky,"" said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and an author of several books on fire history. Quantifying fires that happened more than a century ago can be ""a slippery concept,"" Pyne said.

Using information provided by Pyne and Birgitte Messerschmidt, director of research at the fire protection association, USA TODAY put together a list of the known wildfires or wildfire complexes (groups of fires) with an estimated size of at least 500,000 acres, dating back to 1825. The list came from historical documents, state agency lists, the National Interagency Fire Center and the Western Fire Chiefs Association.

Among all those big fire complexes in history, the Smokehouse Creek Fire ranks eighth largest overall. On a list that includes only fires of at least 500,000 acres since the 1960s, when accuracy started to increase as foresters began measuring burned areas by aircraft, the Smokehouse Creek fire is the largest single fire. Only the Taylor Complex Fire in Alaska in 2004 is larger, at 1.3 million acres.

Nearly half the biggest wildfires occurred in Alaska, including seven in just the past 21 years.

""Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,"" the latest National Climate Assessment reported last year. These fires have ""significant public health, socioeconomic, and ecological implications for the nation,"" the assessment reported.

Warmer temperatures create the kind of conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment stated.

A 2016 study, led by John Abatzoglou, concluded human-caused climate change ""doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984"" in the western U.S. In other research, Abatzoglou documented trends in warming overnight temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.

Fire scientists are working to tease apart the factors influencing large fires, to learn more about the role of climate change, land management and other human influences, McGinnis said. He points out that while climate change is ""almost certainly a factor,"" human activity is responsible for a lot of fire ignitions.

McGinnis is part of a National Science Foundation University of Washington-based research team studying the effects of climate change and how simultaneous large wildfires might affect firefighting.

The research team includes these findings:

Jon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said it's important to remember climate change isn't solely to blame for the increase in large fires.

""It's much more complex than that,"" Keeley said. As the historical lists show, there have been large fires during droughts of the past.

In California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said, and don't appear to be affected by climate change at present. Climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the southern, he said.

Just because a fire is big doesn't mean it's bad, said the fire protection association's Steinberg. Big fires historically were a natural function, to clean the forest floor, put nutrients back into the soil and promote wildflower blooming, all part of healthy ecosystems adapted to fire over thousands of years. Indigenous peoples also used fire to maintain healthy habitats.

The problem arises when houses are in the way.

""When we talk about the rise of wildfire disasters, by that I mean homes and neighborhoods being obliterated by fire,"" Steinberg said. ""We've got fire on the landscape and then we've got all this built environment, frankly in the way, and it's largely not designed to withstand anything like the impacts we're seeing.""

On top of those concerns, Steinberg said fire departments are concerned about their ability to safely fight the large, dangerous blazes, especially in situations like Texas when several large wildfires all pop up in the same region at the same time.

Every five years, the association surveys firefighters about the needs of the 26,000 or so fire departments across the nation. Many are largely staffed by volunteers, and Steinberg said about two-thirds say they lack training and/or personal protective equipment and gear to fight fires safely and successfully.

""That's a terrifying proportion, that we're putting the firefighters lives on the line,"" she said. ""There's a very huge lack of recognition of that problem and it's only going to continue.""

There is a saying in Malawi that if children eat from the fig tree, their parents are the ones who will get sick.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

But as the chair of the P.E.I. Funeral Services and Professions Board, he knows it will take work to rebuild trust in the industry.

The court heard Oakes, who owned Dawson Funeral Home in Crapaud, spent money earmarked for pre-paid funerals for his own personal use.

He had pleaded guilty to 66 counts of fraud, including 36 counts of fraud over $5,000 and 30 counts of fraud under $5,000.

""The industry as a whole was not only shocked to find out this information, but just all around disappointed in the actions that were taken by Dawson Funeral Home and more specifically Mr. Oakes,"" Lamoureux said in an interview with CBC News: Compass host Louise Martin.

""Families, when they enter into a Funeral Home, they're in an environment of trust and that trust was broken. And it's something that the funeral board definitely takes very, very seriously.""

Nathaniel Lamoureux says the P.E.I. Funeral Services and Professions Board has been working with the Department of Justice and Public Safety on measures to make sure nothing like the Dawson Funeral Home case happens again. (CBC/Zoom)

Oakes was sentenced to two years less a day in jail and ordered to pay restitution to his victims.

But since Oakes declared bankruptcy, families of the victims have told CBC News they are not sure how to recoup their losses. Some have asked the government to step in and compensate the victims.

The funeral home shut down in 2022 during the RCMP investigation and was put up for sale.

Lamoureux said funeral homes are required to carry liability insurance of $2,000,000, but it's not clear if that money would be available to victims.

'Essentially unregulated' prior to 2014

The P.E.I. Funeral Services and Professions Board was formed in 2014, and the Prearranged Funeral Services Act was implemented in 2016.

There were associations in place that fostered public awareness of a funeral service and promoted continuing education among the licensed individuals, but prior to 2014, ""funeral service on P.E.I. was essentially unregulated,"" Lamoureux said.

""There was no regulatory board from a funeral perspective to oversee an act like the Prearranged Funeral services Act. But in 2016, when the board was finally in a position to move forward with inspections, we did that right away.""

That said, ""We can only really oversee what's within our act and those are things like licensing, continuing education, you know, health and safety and disciplinary measures, things like that.""

The board has been working closely with the Department of Justice and Public Safety on measures to ensure something like the Dawson Funeral Home case never happens again, he said.

""This is the first time the board has had to deal with an issue like this -- and government for that matter. So it's new territory for all of us.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.207843137254902,448971023,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CVzyKmu5LVt8XXmsVKAEHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/494e5b8b43c91c2a9c8fc21e26cc7324,

An Irish aid worker living in Malawi has said that climate change is posing an ""existential threat"" that could leave parts of the country uninhabitable if temperatures keep rising.

Conor Kelly, who is from Clane in Co Kildare, has lived in the landlocked country in the south-east of Africa with his family for the past few years.

As the small, poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding, Mr Kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challenges.

""Cyclone Idai happened pretty much when I arrived in 2019,"" the programmes manager in Malawi for Irish charity Trocaire said of the second-deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemisphere.

""The evidence is clear - climate change is impacting Malawi,"" he told the PA news agency.

""They are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken, unless we all take action.""

Around three quarters of Malawi's 21 million strong population rely on agriculture, meaning if crops fail, people go hungry.

Over four million people are food insecure in Malawi according to its government, and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months, this could double to eight million.

Mr Kelly said some climate change related events in Europe, such as the 2021 floods in Germany and forest fires in Portugal last year, have ""helped to turn the needle"" on how climate change is viewed in the global north.

He added: ""I think if there was one million people food insecure in Ireland, I think you'd see a lot of action being taken then, while the fact that people are food insecure in Malawi due to climate change, maybe it doesn't bring about the action as quickly.""

Changing weather patterns have also made it difficult for Malawian farmers, who mostly grow the food that they eat, to know when to farm.

Last year, the deadly and powerful Cyclone Freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north. But this year, the south had dry spells in February at a crucial time during the rainy season.

""It's much, much, much, much, much harder for communities to know what the weather will be - when the rains will start, when they will end, how consistent they will be,"" Mr Kelly said.

""Before, times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish. But now it's so much more difficult.""

Farmer Malita Mussa is a single mother-of-six who lives in the Machinga district in southern Malawi.

She said that her maize crop yield last year was ""a bit off"", but this year it is expected to be much worse.

""I expect to harvest one bag, while in the previous years I would have got six bags,"" Malita said, speaking through an interpreter.

Malita, who has four children still living at home, said it may mean going from two meals a day to one, or going days without food.

The woman and her two youngest children, 13-year-old twins Patrick and Patricia, feature on this year's Trocaire box as part of the Irish charity's Lenten appeal.

Asked by the PA news agency what she would say to farmers in Ireland who might be reluctant to make changes to reduce Ireland's carbon emissions, she said: ""To my friends who are also farmers in Ireland, I'm in deep pain and really worried"" due to reduced yields and dry spells.

""I wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as I have.

""If they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that I face in my community.""

She said that she employs good farming practices, diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected.

Speaking through an interpreter, she added: ""I'm urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapt.

""I am encouraging the farmers in Ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate change.""

During the rainy season, Malita's village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains, maize and rice fields and banana, mango and guava trees.

But at the end of this year's rainy season, the fields are pockmarked by wilting crops.

The beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems - after Cyclone Freddy hit in March last year, the village was rendered inaccessible.

In the communities around Lake Chilwa, farmers say they have not recovered completely from Cyclone Freddy.

Agnes Misomali, a maize and rice farmer, said that the 2023 cyclone has meant her crop yield this year is reduced.

She had expected more plantlets, but they had been affected by topsoil being washed away when water ran down the steep mountainside and through the village.

She said she worries for her children's future.

As part of humanitarian efforts, Malawians are being encouraged to diversify their crops to grow the tuber cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas.

They have also encouraged communities to plant trees and not cut them down for fuel, with the aim of anchoring the soil.

Help is also offered to locals who patrol Lake Chilwa to prevent illegal fishing. In 2015, the lake completely dried out, which led to the loss of most species of fish - putting more pressure on another vital food source.

Rising temperatures in southern Malawi due to climate change are also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns, while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost land.

As temperatures rise in the south of the country, in its fourth biggest city and former capital Zomba, malaria is spreading more regularly than before.

""In a way, it's an existential threat to certain areas of southern Malawi because if (rising temperatures) continue, people will not be able to live in those areas,"" Mr Kelly said.

""So the people in Nsanje and Chikwawa that we are working with, if temperatures continue to rise, it'll just be too hot for people to live there. They won't be able to live where they lived for the whole of their lives.""

People moving from their hometowns because of climate change is ""inevitable"", said Peter Chimangeni of Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs.

""Already we have seen the numbers of internally displaced people increasing,"" he said, adding that around 450,000 people were displaced due to Cyclone Freddy last year.

Agnes Jafali, a 54-year-old grandmother, grows maize and rice to feed herself and her family.

Having lived through Cyclone Freddy, she feels lucky to be alive despite it washing her crops away.

A year on, when heavy rain falls or or when the wind blows strongly, she still fears that it is a sign of another powerful cyclone.

Asked what she would say to people who might say such events are just changing weather, or even ""God's doing"", she said she believes some things are human's handiwork.

""People might say climate change is God's doing,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

It echoes Malawi's own fight against climate change - it has not brought about the problem but is suffering the consequences.

A small nation not much bigger than Ireland but with four times its population, Malawi has experienced devastating floods, cyclones and droughts that lead to spells of hunger.

Two deadly cyclones - Freddy in 2023 and Idai in 2019 - devastated Malawi communities while five of the country's worst floods have been in the past 10 years.

Of the 100,000 homes destroyed during Cyclone Freddy last March, just 300 have been rebuilt.

The Malawian government is grappling with multi-billion US dollars worth of damage caused by relentless disasters that it cannot afford to pay.

It has estimated the cost of repairs caused by Cyclone Freddy alone at 680 million US dollars (£539 million).

These extreme weather events keep coming despite the average Malawi citizen emitting just 0.1 tonnes of carbon a year, compared to 6.8 tonnes of carbon per Irish citizen and 4.6 per person in the UK as of 2020.

Yet, in a very human response that may sound familiar to Irish people, a mixture of community and faith keeps Malawians going.

All around, people are seen in their fields, walking for hours to the nearest mill or market, or cleaning clothes.

Along every stretch of russet dirt track and pot-holed major road, people are busy: women walk together balancing blue buckets of grain on their heads, boys herd cattle, teenagers sell piled fruits on plates.

An elderly man chews on sugarcane as he transports a stack more on a bicycle he wheels alongside him.

When asked if people retire in Malawi, the reply was: ""If you stop working, you stop eating.""

Farmer Simeon Kauinga, 40, said life was difficult for him and his family in recent years, as rain became sparse and dry spells common in his Balaka community.

He said his family regularly went hungry as crops failed in his area.

After taking part in a farmer training project, he has diversified his crops, uses organic fertiliser from old crops and has changed his technique to help preserve moisture in his fields.

""As much as we are now still being affected by the dry spells, the survival rate of our crops have improved,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.

""My hopes in the future of my children are reaffirmed because I believe through these methods of farming I will be able to sustain my fields.""

The PA news agency accompanied Irish charity Trocaire to villages in rural southern Malawi and were welcomed by locals dancing and singing, promising to continue the ""good farmer"" practices they have been taught.

They sing about the presence of visitors giving them power and that when other villages heard about their arrival they got malaria they were so sick with jealousy.

They sing because a visit from foreigners from an island called Ireland who have an interest in their plight is a sign of hope.

""We see hope, even when others don't see hope,"" Phillip Nyasulu, Trocaire Malawi's climate justice and disaster risk management officer, told PA.

""Just having someone visiting to chat with you means that a problem half shared is half solved. So, this is why, just by our visit, there is already hope, even where they don't see any hope.

""This is why everyone is happy, because we have hope.

""Personally, I would be surprised if I was going to some of the developed countries and they were in the situation that we are ... trying to have a meeting with them while they're facing the impact.

""I don't think they would be dancing. I don't think they would be smiling. Maybe we don't share the same belief that a problem shared is half resolved.""

Mahindra & Mahindra's CEO Automotive Sector, Nalinikanth Gollagunta, announced plans to roll out five new battery electric vehicles starting January 2025. These electric SUVs, built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform, aim to cater to a wide range of consumers and are part of the company's strategy to have 20 per cent to 30 per cent of its portfolio electric by 2027.

Maruti Suzuki is also investing heavily in EVs, with plans to begin production of a high-spec EV with a 550 km range in FY24-25. The company aims to introduce six EV models over the next 7-8 years. However, Maruti Suzuki's Rahul Bharti emphasised the need for a variety of technologies, including hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, and Ethanol flex fuel, to reduce carbon emissions and oil imports.

But as the chair of the P.E.I. Funeral Services and Professions Board, he knows it will take work to rebuild trust in the industry.

The court heard Oakes, who owned Dawson Funeral Home in Crapaud, spent money earmarked for pre-paid funerals for his own personal use.

He had pleaded guilty to 66 counts of fraud, including 36 counts of fraud over $5,000 and 30 counts of fraud under $5,000.

""The industry as a whole was not only shocked to find out this information, but just all around disappointed in the actions that were taken by Dawson Funeral Home and more specifically Mr. Oakes,"" Lamoureux said in an interview with CBC News: Compass host Louise Martin.

""Families, when they enter into a Funeral Home, they're in an environment of trust and that trust was broken. And it's something that the funeral board definitely takes very, very seriously.""

Oakes was sentenced to two years less a day in jail and ordered to pay restitution to his victims.

But since Oakes declared bankruptcy, families of the victims have told CBC News they are not sure how to recoup their losses. Some have asked the government to step in and compensate the victims.

The funeral home shut down in 2022 during the RCMP investigation and was put up for sale.

Lamoureux said funeral homes are required to carry liability insurance of $2,000,000, but it's not clear if that money would be available to victims.

The P.E.I. Funeral Services and Professions Board was formed in 2014, and the Prearranged Funeral Services Act was implemented in 2016.

There were associations in place that fostered public awareness of a funeral service and promoted continuing education among the licensed individuals, but prior to 2014, ""funeral service on P.E.I. was essentially unregulated,"" Lamoureux said.

""There was no regulatory board from a funeral perspective to oversee an act like the Prearranged Funeral services Act. But in 2016, when the board was finally in a position to move forward with inspections, we did that right away.""

That said, ""We can only really oversee what's within our act and those are things like licensing, continuing education, you know, health and safety and disciplinary measures, things like that.""

The board has been working closely with the Department of Justice and Public Safety on measures to ensure something like the Dawson Funeral Home case never happens again, he said.

""This is the first time the board has had to deal with an issue like this -- and government for that matter. So it's new territory for all of us.""",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,-0.3568627450980392,448970805,1,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6349062.1681737928!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dawson-funeral-home.jpg,

The payment made to Vietnam, making it the first country in the East Asia Pacific region to receive a results-based payment from the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), was for reducing 10.3 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the period spanning February 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019.

This makes for the biggest single payment to date made by the FCPF for verified and high integrity carbon credits. The benefits of this payment are expected to reach 70,055 forest owners and 1,356 neighbouring communities, allocated according to a robust benefit-sharing plan developed through a consultative, participatory, and transparent process.

""The success of this REDD programme brings Vietnam closer to delivering on our ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, while protecting areas of vital importance to biodiversity conservation,"" Vietnamese Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Minh Hoan said.

The country is already generating emission reductions in excess of the volume contracted with the FCPF, and can sell the credits to third party buyers through bilateral agreements or carbon markets.

Vietnam can also use the excess credits to fulfil its Nationally Determined Contributions or retire them, which is a net climate benefit.

""This landmark payment marks another step for Vietnam towards joining the global carbon credit market and opens a new opportunity to finance the country's ambitious climate commitments and targets,"" World Bank Country Director for Vietnam Carolyn Turk said.

The emission reduction programme implemented between 2018 and 2019 has yielded remarkable results, with a total of 16.2 million tonnes verified emission reductions achieved, surpassing the initial target of 10.3 million tonnes outlined in the Emission Reduction Payment Agreement by 5.9 million tonnes. In response to this success, the World Bank has issued a call option notice to acquire an additional 1 million tonne emission reductions beyond the agreed contract volume.

Vietnam's emission reduction programme protects most of the country's tropical forests, covering 3.1 million of the 5.1 million hectares of land in the programme area.

These forests hold immense ecological significance, forming the backbone of five internationally recognised conservation corridors.

The area is also home to 12 per cent of Vietnam's population, including 13 ethnic minority groups and many forest-dependent communities.

Almost one-third of people in the region live below the national poverty line.

Through a multifaceted approach involving enhanced forest management practices, strategic investments in the forestry sector, and the refinement of agricultural policies, the programme is actively expanding both the coverage and quality of forested areas in collaboration with local communities.

The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) is a global partnership of governments, businesses, civil society, and Indigenous Peoples' organisations focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest carbon stock conservation, the sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries, activities commonly referred to as REDD .

Launched in 2008, the FCPF has worked with 47 developing countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, along with 17 donors that have made contributions and commitments totalling 1.3 billion USD./.",en.vietnamplus.vn,news,VietnamPlus,,0.4509803921568627,448970569,1,,eng-9416328

The infomercial headline: ""Climate icon talks hope and regrets."" There's no acknowledgment Gore paid for this message, but it sounds like he did.

McPaper's national climate reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver was like most environmental journalists - extremely one-sided activists, always treating the climate panic as climate ""reality."" That's what Gore's group is called, the ""Climate Reality Project."" Pulver began:

In an era when mounting disasters made worse by the warming climate raise fears for the Earth's future, Al Gore could simply say ""I told you so.""

Instead, the silver-haired grandfather regrets not pushing even harder to raise awareness during his more than four decades of trying to warn the world about the dangers of climate change. ""I guess I could have done more, wish I had done more I guess,"" Gore told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview last week.

Derided by climate change skeptics and pundits for decades, and subjected to memes making light of his concern about global warming, Gore soldiers on.

Then came a list of questions that sounded like they were written by a Gore staffer on his ""Climate Reality Project."" She began by asking what's the ""greatest need"" to address public perception on climate? Gore said more activists in your local community, but added some biblical panic:

Of course Mother Nature is the most powerful advocate. I often say that every night on the TV news is like a nature ride through the Book of Revelation and indeed almost every day now we see these extreme climate-related events all around the world.

When asked ""What's your biggest frustration?,"" Gore said Big Oil's shameless lies:

Well, that we haven't made more progress, and that some of the fossil fuel companies have been shameless in providing, continuing to provide lavish funding for disinformation and misinformation....

I was pretty slow to recognize how important the massive funding of anti-climate messaging was going on. I underestimated the power of greed in the fossil fuel industry, the shamelessness in putting out the lies.... They are continuing to do similar things today to try to fool people and pull the wool over people's eyes just in the name of greed.

""Anti-climate messaging"" is typically skipped in ""objective"" media reporting -- it's loaded with Gore's ""Book of Revelation"" doom and rarely balanced in any way by dissent. Gore demanded the world bow to his will and cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, and words like ""radical"" or ""extreme"" are never used.",newsbusters.org,news,https://newsbusters.org/,,0.07450980392156858,448970544,1,https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-03/Screenshot%202024-03-24%20053710.png?itok=l3fnbB9Q,

The match is taking place on Sunday (March 24) at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur.

Both teams will be eyeing a positive start to their campaign as they will be desperate to go all the way this season. In the last season, LSG qualified for the second year in a row although they could not make it to their maiden IPL final. They finished at the third spot in the points table with eight wins and six losses after the league stage.

On the other hand, RR finished in the fifth spot and failed to make it to the playoffs. Having qualified for the final in 2022, RR won seven and lost seven in 2023 and could not get past the league stage. Both the teams have the required firepower to go all the way this season and they will be desperate to start their campaign on a winning note.

For the RR vs LSG clash in Jaipur, the Rajasthan-based outfit has won the toss and opted to bat first. Speaking at the toss, RR captain Sanju Samson said: ""We would like to bat first today. Looks like a good batting wicket, we were ok to do both, but we've a different combination today. Coming back to Jaipur gives positive vibes in the dressing room. Riyan Parag will be our number 4, Jos, Hetty, Boult are there - Powell could come in as an impact player.""

The first point I would like them to consider is urban sprawl. Looking at the map of my own county, Carroll, the distance between Eldersburg and Sykesville has vanished.

Woodbine is rapidly connecting to that mass, reaching toward Mount Airy, which itself has sprawled well into Frederick County and north toward Taylorsville. Westminster is working on connecting Taneytown, Silver Run, New Windsor, Hamstead, Manchester and Finksburg.

Each time one of the farms goes to housing, the existing citizens protest to protect their water supply and services. Most times they lose, and the developers' promise to provide adequate protection to resources comes up short.

On the national level we have seen land once used by the Garden State, Hollywood Park, Arlington Park, Calder race tracks, and several others, go to development.

Here in Maryland, we used to have tracks in Havre de Grace, Bel Air, Marlboro and Hagerstown that have all been developed. Talk of developing the Timonium Fairgrounds has persisted for years even as that area has already sprawled into an ugly mess.

I keep hearing arguments that racing is a dying sport, which I contest. The best way to depict this argument is the international growth that can best be seen by the Breeders' Cup Races and the world interests that cover that event.

In the states we cover other international events such as Royal Ascot and the Dubai races. Not as much as other events of interest that occur at awkward times. Racing is not like the Olympics as its fans expect to be paid off immediately and not when it is most profitable to air.

Racing's business plan was broken when internet gambling was approved. No longer could they charge to park. No more admission fees. No program sales. No premium seating or dining room overlooking the track. No more concession stands.

I might inject here that when racing first came to this legislature with hat in hand we envisioned slots at the track making up for a lot of that revenue. The legislature royally messed up in the way it approved where the slots went as it created competing forces within the same gambling market.

No longer can we use attendance numbers to gauge interest. No more turnstiles. Handle indicates interest is still viable.

As I contemplate a new business plan that will work, I can see the one you are considering as very possible. With the internet, only a few tracks are needed as broadcast stations to the rest of the world. I can make a strong case for Pimlico and its history being one of those facilities. I have some excellent ideas, but my word limit has expired.

I spent my formative years in Baltimore and I am proud to say that. My immigrant grandparents settled there and sacrificed so much to give their three sons a better life than they ever would have realized in midcentury Greece.

Growing up, besides family and food, I can remember three things that were sacred in our home: the Colts, the Orioles and The Baltimore Sun. I cut my social, sports and political teeth reading The Sun.

Years later when I moved to Carroll County, I subscribed to The Sun and Carroll County Times. After my parents retired to Florida, they visited a couple times a year. My most vivid memories are of awakening to the sound of Dad stirring his coffee as he settled in to read The Sunpaper he missed so much the rest of the year. These quiet mornings were our chance to reconnect on the many issues we had discussed for decades. We had both come a long way.

When in 2014, The Sun purchased the Times, I was not worried at first. I anticipated more repetition, and I was not wrong. Unfortunately, over the next few years, the Times became valuable only for occasional local news pieces and sadly, at my age, obituaries. I eventually took the inevitable step of switching to a joint online subscription to both papers.

Based on this long history, I am moved to write today to express my total disappointment at the newest ownership of these papers. Co-owner Armstrong Williams prints his personal beliefs under the banner of ""Owner's Box."" Primary owner David Smith is supporting a convicted criminal for mayor of Baltimore. He wants to make our papers ""more like FOX News,"" i.e. abridged and inflammatory. I could go on.

I often contemplate abandoning The Sun. Several weeks ago, I did receive a call from our County Commissioners office saying Smith wanted to meet with some community influencers to hear our thoughts on the direction our paper should take.

I pledged my participation. I anxiously await this conversation. Mr. Smith, please listen to us and let us know that you care about longtime supporters of your new asset.

Chris Roemer in the March 17 edition of the newspaper wrote about ""abortion advocates."" This term is inaccurate. There are Americans who are pro-choice, pro-freedom and in favor of women and their doctors being able to determine the best medical care for women without interference from the government.

Hineline argued that writing down seasonal milestones can reduce the oppressive feeling of unease you get when you see the dogwood trees putting out flowers before Easter. We, as humans, are susceptible to an idea from ecology called shifting baseline syndrome, in which we too easily mentally adapt to degradations in our environment because we don't remember how things used to be. We question ourselves (Wait ... that's not right); we rationalize (Was Easter earlier last year, maybe?). Taking notes through the years, Hineline argued, could help. Henry David Thoreau did something similar: He kept a written record of the blooming of local wildflowers, though he probably could not have anticipated that these notes would aid climate scientists over 150 years later.

I thought about Hineline's directive recently. Here in southeastern Ohio, spring is early this year, like it is in many places. But I didn't get just how early until I was downloading old copies of my TinyLetter after that company announced it was shuttering its services. I happened to see that on March 13, 2016, I had noted in my weekly missive that the daffodils were out, trees were in bud, and there were tree frogs singing. ""It's too early for this, by a full two or three weeks,"" 2016 me wrote.

Reading this, 2024 me realized I'd lost the plot. When our daffies came out on March 3 this year, I'd thought, ""Well, at least it's not February."" My baselines! They're shifting!!!

I am not so much a paper record keeper anymore, so while it's not very Thoreauvian, I decided to take my tracking efforts digital. I made a Google spreadsheet, the kind I have for everything else: planning for our child's summer camps, notes about Christmas admin, addresses of friends and family. And I made a column for all the spring milestones I could think of. Spring peepers come earliest for us, or so I think. Then forsythia, daffodils, magnolias, robins, and cherry trees, on down the line.

The good thing about doing this in Google format is that I can add many more columns, as I remember that they exist, and rows, as I happen upon data about past years in photos and emails. (I just remembered: I posted to Instagram the week of March 11, 2020, when I was on social media a lot for some huge, world-changing reason I won't mention here, to show how the forsythia was in full bloom. Into the doc, you go!) In the fall, I will add a sheet to note when the first frost comes, and when the leaves come off different trees in our neighborhood.

I know that keeping track of early spring won't make early spring stop happening. But there's something about having the data that just makes me feel less at sea. And because I'm highly susceptible to gamification, I am now going to go look up the names of more wildflowers so I can make more columns. The world is changing; maybe sometime in the future, someone trying to pin down exactly how can use my notes. For now, doing this makes me, personally, feel 5 to 7 percent better. I'll take it.",slate.com,news,Slate Magazine,Rebecca Onion,-0.003921568627450966,448970181,1,https://compote.slate.com/images/44599f1c-0d3d-4410-9ff0-b36bd0b780ef.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,

The infomercial headline: ""Climate icon talks hope and regrets."" There's no acknowledgment Gore paid for this message, but it sounds like he did.

McPaper's national climate reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver was like most environmental journalists - extremely one-sided activists, always treating the climate panic as climate ""reality."" That's what Gore's group is called, the ""Climate Reality Project."" Pulver began:

In an era when mounting disasters made worse by the warming climate raise fears for the Earth's future, Al Gore could simply say ""I told you so.""

Instead, the silver-haired grandfather regrets not pushing even harder to raise awareness during his more than four decades of trying to warn the world about the dangers of climate change. ""I guess I could have done more, wish I had done more I guess,"" Gore told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview last week.

Derided by climate change skeptics and pundits for decades, and subjected to memes making light of his concern about global warming, Gore soldiers on.

Then came a list of questions that sounded like they were written by a Gore staffer on his ""Climate Reality Project."" She began by asking what's the ""greatest need"" to address public perception on climate? Gore said more activists in your local community, but added some biblical panic:

Of course Mother Nature is the most powerful advocate. I often say that every night on the TV news is like a nature ride through the Book of Revelation and indeed almost every day now we see these extreme climate-related events all around the world.

When asked ""What's your biggest frustration?,"" Gore said Big Oil's shameless lies:

Well, that we haven't made more progress, and that some of the fossil fuel companies have been shameless in providing, continuing to provide lavish funding for disinformation and misinformation....

I was pretty slow to recognize how important the massive funding of anti-climate messaging was going on. I underestimated the power of greed in the fossil fuel industry, the shamelessness in putting out the lies.... They are continuing to do similar things today to try to fool people and pull the wool over people's eyes just in the name of greed.

""Anti-climate messaging"" is typically skipped in ""objective"" media reporting -- it's loaded with Gore's ""Book of Revelation"" doom and rarely balanced in any way by dissent. Gore demanded the world bow to his will and cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, and words like ""radical"" or ""extreme"" are never used.",newsbusters.org,news,https://newsbusters.org/,,0.07450980392156858,448969930,1,https://www.newsbusters.org/s3/files/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-03/Screenshot%202024-03-24%20053710.png?itok=l3fnbB9Q,

However, after the candle burns out, there is a jar left behind, which is usually just thrown away because people don't know how to clean it from the wax.

At first, cleaning glasses from candle residue may seem like a daunting task. However, there is one life hack that will surprise you with its simplicity. A cleaning expert showed how it works in her TikTok.

Usually, candles are sold in very cute little jars that you want to reuse for storing little things. Still, you wonder how to clean it properly.

They say that everything ingenious is simple, and it's true because all you need to clean a candle jar is hot water.

How it works

All you need to do is pour boiling water into the jar so that it covers all the wax residue. Due to the high temperature, it will gradually begin to melt and float to the surface of the liquid.

Once the water has cooled and the wax that has risen hardens, it can be easily removed. However, sometimes, depending on the type of wax, you will need to do this procedure 2-3 times to completely melt the entire candle.

After that, all you have to do is rinse the jar with warm water and detergent and it's ready to use again.

This method is most effective for jars made of glass or other heat-resistant materials. Thus, you need to be careful if your candle was in a plaster planter or other delicate materials as they can crack from a sudden change in temperature.

In addition, never flush wax down the drain if you don't want to pay for plumbing services. It's better to either throw the leftover wax in the trash or collect it to melt it into a new candle.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,0.3568627450980393,448969817,1,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/3/24/7ffe4d2d-31f5-4e1e-9040-8eb88872e0ab.png?size=2010x1050,eng-9421438

Your roof performs a good-sized role in regulating indoor temperatures and energy intake, making it critical to explore energy-efficient roofing options. In this weblog publish, we'll look into diverse strength-efficient Atlanta Roof Repair, helping you make knowledgeable choices to enhance comfort, lessen software bills, and make a contribution to environmental sustainability.

Understanding the Importance of Energy-Efficient Roofing

The sweltering warmth of Atlanta summers and the occasional wintry weather kickback can take a toll on your home's strength intake and luxury stages. An energy-efficient roof acts as a barrier towards heat transfer, maintaining your property cooler in summer and warmer in iciness. By reducing the strain on your HVAC gadget, strength-green roofing can lead to lower power payments and a reduced carbon footprint.

Exploring Energy-Efficient Roofing Options

Energy-efficient roofing includes cool roofs, efficient inexperienced roofs, metallic roofs, inexperienced roofs, and sun roofs. Cool roofs mimic daylight hours and reduce warmth absorption, at the same time, inexperienced roof tiles include technology that limits heat switches. The metallic roof absorbs daylight and unexpectedly releases the absorbed warmness. Green roofs consist of flora that acts as herbal insulation, even as sunroofs generate strength from sunlight. These alternatives lessen energy consumption, boost cabin comfort, and decrease environmental impact. Choosing their home decor completely depends on the climate, financial balance in widespread, and long-term aspirations for energy performance and economic system.

Cool Roofs

Cool roofs are designed to mirror greater sunlight and take in much less warmness than traditional roofing substances. They commonly function as mild-colored or reflective surfaces that limit sun warmness gain. Keeping your house cooler in the course of warm summertime months. Cool roofs can help reduce strength consumption, improve indoor consolation, and extend the lifespan of your roofing device.

Energy-Efficient Shingles

Energy-efficient shingles are specifically engineered to beautify thermal overall performance and decrease heat absorption. These shingles regularly comprise advanced technologies inclusive of sun-reflective granules. Also, coatings that reflect sunlight and save you from warmness buildup. Additionally, by minimizing warmth switches to the attic and interior spaces, power-efficient shingles can lower cooling charges and enhance normal energy efficiency.

Metal Roofing

Metal roofing is a durable and electricity-efficient option for Atlanta houses. It has excessive solar reflectance and thermal emittance residences. This means they reflect a large portion of the sun's rays and launch absorbed warmness quickly. Additionally, this enables less heat switch to the indoors of the house. Keeping it cooler and extra snug without immoderate reliance on air con.

Green Roofs

Green roofs, additionally known as dwelling roofs or vegetative roofs, are becoming increasingly famous as electricity-efficient roofing answers. These roofs are protected with vegetation, which acts as herbal insulation and absorbs warmth, lowering temperature fluctuations in the domestic. Green roofs also improve air first-class, mitigate city heat island consequences, and offer habitat for flora and fauna.

Solar Roofing

Solar roofing systems harness the sun's electricity to generate energy for your house. By integrating photovoltaic (PV) panels immediately into the roofing material, solar roofs can offset strength consumption and reduce reliance on grid-provided strength. In addition to generating smooth, renewable strength, sun roofing can also increase the value of your property and qualify for tax incentives and rebates.

Choosing the Right Energy-Efficient Roofing Option

When selecting an electricity-green roofing option in your Atlanta domestic, recollect elements together with climate, budget, aesthetics, and lengthy-term performance. Consult with a reputable roofing contractor who focuses on strength-efficient solutions to evaluate your wishes, evaluate to-be-had options, and decide the best in shape for your own home.

Let's move,"Ports are hotspots for local emissions and air pollutants, with frontline workers and nearby communities suffering disproportionate harm from these pollutants. Resources to address these issues have, for years, been insufficient or unfocused. The Port of Wilmington serves as an example of the struggle to address a legacy of environmental injustices while transitioning to a clean energy economy. Yet, the Inflation Reduction Act -- signed into law in 2022 by President Joe Biden -- is now providing an opportunity to increase protections for Environmental Justice communities with a newly-launched $3 billion Clean Ports Program.

Delaware has a poor record of enforcing environmental regulations and the Wilmington port community has experienced at least 100 years of neglect. With a recent agreement for the new Wilmington port manager, Enstructure, to assume operations at the port came enthusiastic talk of expansion and the promise of jobs. What is not being discussed, however, is the impacts that this expansion will have on the health and wellbeing of communities that surround the port -- which are largely Black and low-income residents already negatively impacted by port operations.

According to Jeffrey Richardson, the chair of the Delaware Community Benefits Agreement Coalition, ""This nation has lost credibility at home and abroad for many of its environmental policies. The IRA is a long overdue vehicle for directing funds to some of our most environmentally compromised communities. The new Wilmington port manager, Enstructure, should be working with our coalition to aggressively pursue funds to clean its operations. Securing these funds will help reduce diesel emissions and contribute to cleaner air for port-adjacent Environmental Justice communities.""

Expansion at the Port of Wilmington means increased truck traffic, diesel emissions, and the off-port development that will likely occur as warehouse space is expanded. The planned process to make the port accessible to larger cargo ships will release sediments from the river containing dangerous levels of PCBs, dioxin, arsenic, and thallium. The owners of the port, Diamond State Port Corporation, have yet to commit to work closely with surrounding communities to consider the implications of expansion. Accordinging to a previous statement issued by the DCBAC, substantive participation by community residents has not occurred in the planning and review process, and the health of environmental justice communities hasn't been considered. This is unacceptable and not in accordance with guidelines for a project that has received federal dollars from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Environmental justice challenges at ports are a critical issue not just in Wilmington, but nationwide. Marine vessels are one of the largest emitters of cancer-causing pollutants near ports. Increases in activity in the global freight transportation system have surpassed any gains by EPA rules, which have not been amended in over a decade.

Nevertheless, there's good news. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there are programs making grants available right now to begin the clean energy transition at our ports, including the Port Infrastructure and Development Program and the aptly-named Reduction of Truck Emissions at Ports Program. Another $3 billion offered through the Clean Ports Program to fund zero-emission port equipment and to help ports develop climate action plans. This new program will build on EPA's Ports Initiative that is helping ports nationwide address public health and environmental impacts on surrounding communities. Funding under the Clean Ports Program can be used for charging infrastructure, electric drayage trucks, vessel shore power, electric switcher locomotives, battery storage systems, and electric cargo handling equipment.

As Kim Gaddy, the National Environmental Justice Director for Clean Water Action, writes: ""President Biden is proud to call Wilmington home, and the IRA and IIJA should be used to help clean up his hometown port. Now it is incumbent on the Port of Wilmington to start applying for this funding and working with its neighboring communities, to make the transition to the clean energy economy. Our environmental justice communities, climate, and planet can't wait.""

This investment will support the expansion of what VDOT calls ""a robust network of EV charging infrastructure."" The funding will close existing gaps along Interstates 64, 77, 81, 85, 95, and 295, which will be designated as alternative fuel corridors (AFCs).

Under the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, state departments of transportation will oversee the disbursement of $5 billion through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, VDOT explained. The NEVI Program aims to construct a reliable national network of EV charging stations, with initial stations required to be located along designated AFCs.

As detailed in VDOT's EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan, it intends to distribute over $100 million over the next four years through the NEVI Program to serve the following goals:

The initial $11.3 million investment under Phase 1-A of VDOT's NEVI Program will facilitate the deployment of third-party owned and operated EV charging stations at 18 sites across 13 counties, adding 66 fast charging ports across the Commonwealth, VDOT said. VDOT noted that 14 of these charging stations are located within a half-mile of federally designated disadvantaged communities.

Proposed locations were screened against federal requirements, with awardees selected through a competitive scoring process that evaluated location, station cost, level of applicant match funding, applicant qualifications, nearby amenities such as restrooms, dining, and shopping, and other customer experience-focused factors, VDOT said.

The awards for NEVI Phase I-A were presented to the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) during its March 19 meeting. VDOT added that the awards remain subject to potential changes pending environmental reviews, site host commitments, utility connection, and other relevant factors.

The VDOT NEVI Program will continue to expand the statewide network of charging stations with multiple upcoming rounds of competitive award solicitations, it said.

China is by far the world's worst GHG emitter. Its contribution to global GHG emissions is about 32 per cent. So, let's sell China our natural gas, which is a lot cleaner than the coal the Chinese currently use. And sell our LNG to other large emitters as well. This would actually help the planet and would also bring revenues to Canadians. It's called a ""win-win"" solution.

Why our PM is rejecting this ""win-win"" solution is a mystery. Perhaps saving the planet is not his real objective.

In John Ivison's column, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau characterizes his government as ""confident,"" since it's willing to invest in its people. I would argue that a confident administration would tell the climate alarmists within and outside our country that the responsible management of our fossil fuel industries is essential for our energy security and economic well-being and key to helping less fortunate nations reduce their reliance on coal.

A confident country would have the backbone to say that unrealistic targets for carbon-free energy production put our own citizens at risk.

Virginia is accepting applications for the Infrastructure Grant funding through April 15.

""This partnership between USDA and Virginia is allowing critical funding to reach areas of the supply chain that need it most,"" said USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs Under Secretary Jenny Lester Moffitt. ""The projects funded through this program will create new opportunities for the region's small and midsize producers to thrive, expand access to nutritious food options, and increase supply chain resiliency.""

In May, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the availability of up to $420 million through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) authorized by the American Rescue Plan to strengthen local and regional food systems, it said.

Through this program, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has entered into cooperative agreements with state agencies, commissions, or departments responsible for agriculture, commercial food processing, seafood, or food system and distribution activities or commerce activities in states or U.S. territories.

Using RFSI funding, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) will fund projects that increase cold storage and flash freezing facilities, provide more transportation options, modernize equipment for value-added processing, and expand capacity for aggregation, according to the USDA.

""There are approximately 41,500 farm operations in the Commonwealth with the vast majority of these being family owned. To help local and regional farms and food businesses achieve scale and efficiencies, we must invest in supply chain infrastructure and help facilitate market access,"" said Joseph Guthrie, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Those interested in receiving a sub-award should apply directly through VDACS by April 15. AMS encourages applications that serve smaller farms and ranches, new and beginning farmers and ranchers, underserved producers, veteran producers, and underserved communities.

Through the program and in addition to the Infrastructure Grant funding, VDACS will support supply chain coordination and technical assistance to farmers and food businesses operating in processing, aggregation and distribution, USDA said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",mexicostar.com,news,Mexico Star,,0.3098039215686275,448969034,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

A section of IT employees in Bengaluru, under the banner of KITU, staged a protest in front of the labour commissioner's office on March 16, which brought the issue to the limelight. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel

The IT/ITeS sector, which employs more than two million workers in Karnataka, has obtained an exemption from the applicability of the IE(SO) Act on more than four occasions. The last time the exemption was given was on May 25, 2019, and this exemption is about to lapse by May 25, 2024.

""KITU, the only registered union of IT/ITeS sector employees in Karnataka, which has a membership of more than ten thousand, demanded the government not renew the exemption anymore as the employers have not complied with the four conditions imposed on them while giving the exemption,"" KITU said in a statement.

""The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act is archaic, and modern businesses, IT or not, should not be governed by them. This Act was legislated a long time ago. Even the first line in the act considers the legislation itself 'expedient', which means, 'convenient and practical although possibly improper or immoral',"" said Binod Singh, founder and CEO, of Cross Identity, a global player in identity and access management.

Singh explains that while the protest to reinstate the Act seems like a response to the mass layoffs in the industry, it is the nature of business. ""If a company is failing and wants to retain some chance at success, sometimes mass layoffs are necessary. It is the nature of employment and the nature of modern business. Enforcing the protection of jobs via government laws helps nobody. The company will fail if it is forced to comply with such backward laws and red tape,"" he said.

V. Balakrishnan, former board member at Infosys, concurs with the views that the IT industry is a sunrise sector and it should be provided with growth opportunities while protecting the rights of employees. ""The IT industry needs flexible regulations if it has to compete globally. The startup industry too is at the growth stage and needs flexibility. Too much regulation will cripple the industry and will affect its competitiveness. The need of the hour is for the government to continue with the exemption and strictly enforce the conditions provided in the standing order act, which to a large extent, protects the interests of employees,"" he said.

A former C-level executive of a Bengaluru-based IT company said that most companies in the IT sector follow global HR best practices and therefore can be exempted from archaic labour laws. ""We are a global industry with business across geographies and employees all over the world, so we should be exempted from the labour department's ambit,"" he said on condition of anonymity.

Some companies have urged the Karnataka Labour Ministry to have broad stakeholder discussions with labour union leaders and the IT sector to determine the potential consequences of withdrawing the exemption.

""To minimise any negative effects on businesses while also protecting workers' rights, consider gradual implementation or transition periods. Furthermore, any negative effects on the business's competitiveness can be mitigated by sponsoring skill-development activities and cultivating an environment that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship,"" said Vikas Sharma, founder and director, of Hi-Com Networks, an internet services provider.

Sharma suggests that if IT/ITeS companies were to be brought under the labour law, the government could consider developing procedures for equitable and open hiring, ""offering sufficient protection from wrongful termination, setting up procedures for settling labour disputes and encouraging gender diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Provisions for emerging issues such as gig economy employment, remote work arrangements, and the use of future technology in the IT business may also be included. All things considered, the revisions should aim to strike a balance between protecting workers' rights and helping the IT sector to grow sustainably.""",business-standard.com,news,Business Standard,"Ayushman Baruah, Aneeka Chatterjee",-0.1529411764705882,448968870,1,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2023-10/02/full/1696213141-0349.jpg,

Children born with a congenital heart defect often endure surgery early in life, and during surgery their thymus is routinely removed, as it blocks the surgeons access to the heart. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the long-term immunologic and clinical effects of early childhood thymectomy. Objectives: Investigation of the immunologic effects of early childhood thymectomy at 18 months and 18 years of age with regards to the subset composition of T cells, thymic output and the T cell receptor repertoire diversity (I, II). Investigation of the association between early childhood thymectomy and risks of autoimmune diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and atopic diseases (III). Methods: Lymphocyte subsets were characterized with flow cytometry in eleven subjects preoperatively, at 18 months and 18-years follow-up. In addition, the T cell receptor repertoire was analyzed with TCR Vß flow cytometry, T cell receptor excision circles were quantified with PCR and telomere lengths of T and B cells were analyzed with PCR at 18-year follow-up (I). Also, the diversity of the T cell receptor and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was determined using next generation sequencing (II). A nationwide population based cohort study was conducted using Swedish patient registers to identify subjects and controls and to analyze clinical outcome measures (III). Results: Thymectomy was associated with a reduction in the number of T cells, especially the naive subset. The naive regulatory T cells and recent thymic emigrants (CD31+ T cells) were also reduced. TRECs, indicative of thymic output, were below detection level in all but one thymectomized individual. Telomere lengths were shorter in CD8+ T cells of thymectomized individuals (I). Disturbances were found in the TCR Vß repertoire (I), and sequencing of the T cell receptor confirmed reduced diversity (II). Compared with surgery controls, thymectomized individuals were at increased risk for hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes and both viral and bacterial infections. Compared with the general population they were at increased risk for hypothyroidism, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatic diseases, celiac disease, cancer, infections and asthma (III). Conclusion: Early childhood thymectomy is associated with immunologic aberrations as well as with increased risks of autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections. These observations stress that avoidance of total thymectomy during early cardiac surgery is advisable.

Energy efficiency constitutes a potent catalyst for economic expansion, propelling demand for energy-efficient products and services. This burgeoning demand stimulates innovation and entrepreneurship, spurring the development of cutting-edge technologies and business models. Consequently, nations can augment their industrial competitiveness while fostering a conducive ecosystem for sustainable growth. Furthermore, the proliferation of energy efficiency initiatives nurtures a culture of resource optimisation, thereby ingraining principles of fiscal prudence within the economic fabric.

By curtailing energy consumption and bolstering domestic production, energy efficiency initiatives diminish reliance on imported energy sources, thereby fortifying energy security. Nations endowed with abundant renewable resources can harness the potential of energy efficiency to reduce their carbon footprint while concurrently mitigating vulnerabilities associated with global energy markets. This transition towards energy autonomy insulates economies against geopolitical uncertainties, ensuring a stable and resilient energy landscape.

Energy efficiency initiatives engender a virtuous cycle of environmental stewardship by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating air pollution, and conserving natural resources. Furthermore, the concomitant improvements in air quality confer substantial health benefits, thereby alleviating the burden on healthcare systems and enhancing overall societal well-being.

Energy-efficient infrastructure stands as a bulwark against the vagaries of climate change and natural disasters, bolstering societal resilience in the face of adversity. Buildings fortified with energy-efficient designs exhibit heightened resilience to extreme weather events, thereby minimising property damage and preserving livelihoods. Similarly, transportation systems equipped with energy-efficient technologies mitigate congestion and enhance mobility, fostering economic continuity amidst disruptions in energy supply.

The embrace of energy efficiency catalyses a renaissance of innovation, propelling advancements in clean energy technologies, innovative grid systems, and sustainable practices. Nations at the vanguard of energy efficiency innovation carve a niche in the global marketplace, positioning themselves as pioneers in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. This technological leadership augments industrial competitiveness and fosters cross-sectoral collaboration, fostering synergies that propel sustainable development agendas.

Energy efficiency emerges as a linchpin of economic prosperity, offering a panacea for myriad socio-economic challenges. By harnessing the multifaceted benefits of energy efficiency, Zimbabwe can foster sustainable growth trajectories, enhance societal well-being, and fortify its resilience in the face of global uncertainties. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, prioritising energy efficiency is imperative, forging a path towards a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable future for future generations.

Cook took part in a discussion at the annual China Development Forum on carbon neutrality and climate change, and how companies could reduce adverse effects on their businesses. Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint -- with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon neutral product.

""We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,"" Cook said on the company's environmental goal. Artificial intelligence ""provides an enormous toolkit for every company that's wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,"" he said.

The Apple CEO returned to the Beijing event after being one of the marquee names on last year's list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. Cook spoke with China Premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li's opening speech.

Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because ""it's so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming here."" Last week, Cook's social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.

""To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,"" Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co., Lens Technology Co. and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.

The environmental theme to Cook's trip -- which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai on Thursday -- may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the US and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner doesn't divest. Apple has been on the receiving end of China's riposte, as it's had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.

Apple's global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.

The company has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 metric tons of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network.

The seventh-year veteran signed a 10-day contract Saturday as the team continues to struggle with depth following the season-ending injuries of Patrick Williams and Zach LaVine.

Green, 30, is a familiar face, having logged 113 games in Chicago over the last three seasons. He was a crucial contributor over that time, but a right knee injury in 2022-23 limited him to only 32 games.

Saturday night's matchup against the Boston Celtics marked his return to the Bulls and the NBA.

But the real reunion happened two weeks ago in San Francisco after a game against the Golden State Warriors.

Green spent the last two months playing with Santa Cruz, the Warriors' G League affiliate. So it was a natural decision to attend the March 7 game when the Bulls visited the Warriors.

Green waited outside the locker room for coach Billy Donovan, who wrapped him up in a hug upon seeing his former player.

Green's entry to the locker room that night was met with enthusiastic shouts as he greeted his former teammates.

""I just felt the love,"" Green said.

Barely two weeks later, Green received a call from the Bulls about coming back to Chicago on the shortterm deal.

It has been more than a year since Green played in an NBA game. He underwent an arthroscopic debridement in his right knee in January 2023, then played roughly 30 minutes over four games scattered from March 20 to April 7.

In the run-up to the main event on March 20, fashion students undertook an upcycling workshop on Tuesday, March 19, which was held across three classes.

Teams of students had to work together to upcycle three garments in less than three and a half hours.

The finished products were then exhibited in the Campus's main foyer where they could be seen and admired by all students, staff and visitors. Chester Campus's Photography students collaborated with the event organisers, taking high-quality photos of the finished garments and models.

Level 3 Fashion Business & Retail student Scarlett said: ""Putting the outfits together was my favourite part of the whole event! Working behind the scenes, deciding who needs to wear what, and helping to bring it all together was amazing.

""I'm thinking about a career as a fashion buyer and sustainability is a main part of the job, so the 'Unravelled' event will be really beneficial for my future.""

Chester Campus also played host to sustainability talks by prominent figures in the fashion industry, including a Q&A with the Director of Cheshire Fashion Week (CFW), Claire Namukolo Raven, who shared the various ways that CFW champions sustainability.

Also in attendance was a former Cheshire College Art & Design Lecturer Rachel Davies, who is now working as a freelance artist and makes frequent use of textiles for her work. Rachel demonstrated how to elevate and innovate items without creating the damaging textile waste of the fast fashion cycle.

Level 3 student Alex said: ""The meetings with Claire and Rachel were so informative; they were giving first-hand advice for our dream lives!

""As the fashion community is forever growing, it is important to be ethical and sustainable when thinking of fashion, as it's one of the top waste producers. We all need to recognise our contribution and combat the negatives to create change.""

The campus also hosted a Swap Shop Clothing Exchange which encouraged students to bring in their unwanted clothing which they could then exchange for a different item of preloved clothing. All unclaimed clothing at the end of the day was donated to local charity providers, in line with ethical practices.

Already, Governor Nasir Idris has constituted a State Taskforce Committee for Environmental Sanitation which would collaborate with the officials of the Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources and other relevant authorities to execute the task.

Commissioner for Environment and Mineral Resources, Alhaji Musa Muhammed who briefed journalists yesterday in Birnin Kebbi over the development, noted that his ministry has held a meeting with relevant stakeholders where they strategised on how the exercise would be conducted successfully.

The commissioner said the essence of reintroducing the monthly sanitation exercise was to complement the efforts of the governor at beautifying the state capital and its environs.

According to him, the beautification of the state capital and other towns in the four Emirates would be worthless if the environment is not secured for human habitation.

""Before we commence, we want go round the state to mobilise the general public on the importance of re-introducing the sanitation exercise so that by the time we start everybody is aware,"" he said.

There's been much debate over exactly what Trump meant when he said that if he loses the presidential election in November, ""it's going to be a bloodbath for the country.""

Some interpreted Trump's brutish remark as a threat that he would incite another Jan. 6-style insurrection if President Joe Biden is reelected in November.

Trump vigorously pushed back, claiming the comment was in the context of the threat of Chinese electric cars coming to the United States, destroying Detroit's automakers and Michigan's economy.

""Now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole -- that's gonna be the least of it,"" he said at the Ohio rally. ""It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That will be the least of it. But they're not going to sell those cars. They're building massive factories.""

Trump and many Republicans are highly critical of what they claim is Biden's drive to force Americans to drive electric cars. They also see the politically charged debate over electric vehicles as a potent campaign issue in Michigan, a crucial, auto-reliant swing state.

Biden on March 20 issued the nation's strongest-ever vehicle tailpipe emissions limits on cars and light trucks. But the new Environmental Protection Agency rules give automakers more time to reach emission targets than the EPA had earlier proposed.

A lobbying group that represents virtually every U.S. and foreign automaker selling cars in the U.S, said the industry supports the new emissions standards, but called them ""a stretch goal.""

""The future is electric. Automakers are committed to the EV transition,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

And the United Auto Workers union, which has expressed concerns that electric vehicles could cost tens of thousands of union jobs, also supports the new EPA emission rules.

""We reject the fearmongering that says tackling the climate crisis must come at the cost of union jobs,"" the UAW said in a statement.

But the new emissions standards come at a fraught time for Detroit automakers, which are spending billions of dollars to eventually phase out climate-warming, gasoline-burning vehicles.

Those investments are being supplemented with billions of more dollars in manufacturer and consumer subsidies from Washington.

While a record 1.2 million electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. last year (more than half of those were Teslas), dealers complain those cars and trucks are piling up on their lots, the nation's charging infrastructure is a mess and Detroit automakers, particularly General Motors, struggle to the new technology vehicles.

Layered on top of those issues is the existential threat of fast-growing Chinese automakers eventually dominating the U.S. market with high-quality, low-priced electric cars.

""They're going to be on our shores in Mexico in the not-too-distant future,"" said veteran auto industry analyst Kristin Dziczek at the Chicago Federal Reserve's annual automotive outlook conference in February.

As president, Trump said he would secure America's economic southern border by slapping a 100% tariff on Chinese cars entering the U.S.

Speaking like the head of one Mafia crime family to another, Trump addressed China President Xi Jinping directly in his Ohio campaign rally. Trump said he and Xi were friends, but bad stuff will happen if Xi pushes things too far.

""Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now ... you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to sell the cars to us, no,"" the syntax-challenged Mar-a-Lago godfather said. ""We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected.""

But that's a campaign promise Trump might not be able to keep. Under the United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement, which the Trump administration negotiated as an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement, vehicles flow across the three countries' borders tax-free if they meet domestic content agreements.

China also might be able to sell vehicles profitably in the U.S. directly from its homeland, even with the 25% tariff Trump slapped on them while he was president. Prior to that, the tariff was 2.5%.

BYD (""Build Your Dreams""), the Warren Buffet-backed Chinese automaker, makes an electric car for its home market called the Seagull that reportedly is making auto executives and U.S. policymakers sweat.

""This is the car that scares me,"" said Dziczek, a policy adviser at the Chicago Fed.

Dziczek said the Seagull, which sells for about $10,000 in China, could be sold profitably in the U.S. for $15,000. That's about half the price of a Nissan Leaf, the cheapest electric car sold here.

The Seagull might also point to a costly miscalculation by Detroit automakers, which have largely abandoned the sedan and small-car market segments.

Automakers say they build mostly large, pricey gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks because those are the types of vehicles Americans want. But their fear that Chinese automakers will take over the U.S. market with their small, low-cost, battery-powered cars challenges that assumption.",michiganadvance.com,news,Michigan Advance,,-0.1764705882352942,448967998,1,https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trump-speech-Aug-4-2023-02.jpeg,eng-9417990

That's by design.

A statewide lottery is banned in Nevada's 159-year-old constitution. The constitution was written when lotteries were seen as corrupt and coincided with a series of national reforms, most famously abolition, that swept the United States in the 1800s.

""By the early 19th century, most lotteries were crooked. These lotteries were either not giving the prize, or being fixed,"" Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who specializes in Nevada and Las Vegas history, told the Washington Examiner.

The casino industry has made sure statewide lotteries have remained banned, and neighboring states such as California and Arizona are reaping the benefits while locals miss out. However, a change to the ban may be within reach.

In 2023, Assemblyman Cameron ""C.H."" Miller introduced an amendment to enact a statewide lottery, with revenue from the lottery allocated to mental health funding.

""This constitutional amendment authorizing a lottery and dedicating the revenue to funding for youth mental health is a common sense solution that will help the many Nevada youth who are battling mental health challenges, just like I did as a child,"" Miller said.

""Right now, we are sending millions of dollars across the border to neighboring states. It is time to fully invest in Nevadans and pass this constitutional amendment,"" he said. Mississippi, the most recent state to enact a statewide lottery, has seen $488 million generated since 2019, all dedicated to the state's Department of Transportation and Department of Education.

The road to the amendment may be bumpy, though. Since 1975, there have been 30 failed attempts at amending the state's constitution to enact the lottery. The casino industry, one of the state's most powerful entities, has long posed a barrier to the change.

The casino industry says ""there's not really a lot of creation of jobs and economic development"" in statewide lotteries, Mark Nichols, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies the gaming industry, told the Washington Examiner. The casino industry is the largest employer in Las Vegas, the state's population center.

""That would take away from the gaming industry's ability to do what it does best, which is to create new jobs and generate new revenue for the states, so it would come at the expense of something else,"" Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resorts Association, said on the topic of a statewide lottery in 2016.

Nichols said that argument only works to a certain extent, as many games within casinos and in places such as grocery stores, bars, and airports across Nevada also don't require someone to man them.

""Grocery stores, convenience stores, pretty much most bars have slot machines in them as well,"" Nichols said. ""But those don't create a lot of jobs, don't create a lot of economic development. People don't travel across the country to do that and say, 'Hey, let's go to that 7/11 and play.'""

""Everyone's operating already in states where there are lotteries. They're doing fine. They're doing well,"" Miller said. ""The operation of a lottery could compete with their business, and it's my position that it shouldn't be a competition. We can be partners together.""

Featured Local Savings

Still, based on other states with both legalized gambling and lotteries, there seems to be little competition between the two, such as in Massachusetts.

""In Massachusetts, we actually had lottery data at the outlet level, so we knew what every single store in Massachusetts sold as far as lottery tickets,"" Nichols said. ""We looked at what happened to lottery sales after casinos in Massachusetts opened, and really we did not see any kind of decrease in lottery sales whatsoever.""

He said they examined individual store data near casinos and found that industries had no effect on each other's sales.

Nicols said the lottery entices people because casinos don't offer games with such high winnings for such a low dollar amount bet. Nichols also said Nevadans are aware of the ins and outs of gaming like scratch cards, which are also small-dollar buy-ins, but low earnings as compared to the lottery.

""Most people that gamble, particularly that gamble regularly and live in Nevada, they know that they're probably not going to be too enticed to play scratch cards,"" Nichols said.

A lottery would then be mostly bought by residents, not people traveling to Nevada to gamble because they can likely buy a lottery ticket in their home state.

""Tourists might make it part of their experience. I'm not sold on its importance to tourism, since it's available elsewhere,"" Green said.

Without having a statewide lottery, Nevada is losing out on millions of dollars of sales to neighboring states.

A 2016 report showed a lotto store in the California-Nevada border town of Primm, 30 minutes south of Las Vegas with a population of 1,000, sold $13 million worth of lottery tickets in a single year. That road that divides the two states is called ""Lotto Store Road.""

""There's a store that's right here on the border; it's 10 miles from where I'm sitting, and that's, I think, one of California's best outlets for lottery sales,"" Nichols said. ""The border literally goes right down the middle of the store. So, on one side, you can buy lottery tickets, and on one side, you can use slot machines.""

It'll be a long and uphill battle for Miller's amendment legalizing a statewide lottery. The legislature would have to vote again on the bill in 2025. Then the law would be put on a ballot for a statewide vote. The earliest estimate places the vote on a 2027 ballot.

Established in March 2020, the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF) stands as one of the intervention programs facilitating fund distribution to healthcare firms in Nigeria.

It was set up with a dual objective: to reduce health tourism, thereby preserving foreign exchange reserves, and to provide long-term, cost-effective financing for healthcare infrastructure development.

These funds have been mobilised through a specialised Differentiated Cash Reserve Ratio (DCRR) mechanism, designated specifically to provide affordable financing to Deposit Money Banks (DMBs).

The aim is to ensure broader access to financial resources for healthcare initiatives by facilitating the provision of credit to beneficiaries within the health sector.

Over the past four years, the implementation of the healthcare sector intervention facility has led to the creation of 162,454 jobs, both directly and indirectly.

A total of 137 healthcare companies in Nigeria received support from the CBN intervention fund allocation.

N138.3 billion was disbursed through the program, with N37.2 billion of principal already repaid. Additionally, N4.9 billion in interest has been repaid. Presently, beneficiaries owe a total of N99.3 billion.

Nairametrics has ranked the top 10 beneficiaries of the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF) according to the CBN report.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has said that Nigeria would need between $10 billion and $15 billion in the next two to three years to ramp up its existing gas infrastructure.

The Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, gave the estimate at the 2024 edition of CERAWeek, a global oil and gas event in Houston, the United States, organised by S&P Global.

The programme which ended on Friday was themed: ""Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, Climate, Technology and Geopolitics.""

Kyari argued that the main focus of the NNPC at the moment, is building capacity to deliver gas into the domestic market, reiterating that Nigeria remains a gas country with associated oil rather than the other way round.

Nigeria has over 208 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of proven gas reserves and about 600 TCF in potential reserves, but can hardly get the resource out of the ground due to lack of infrastructure and the much-needed investment in the sector.

But highlighting the ongoing conversations around energy transition, the NNPCL GCEO noted that the country takes the issue of energy availability very seriously as well as the cheapest route to explore it.

The NNPC's chief executive argued that there is now a clear opportunity that gas has on Sunday, which wasn't there 10 years ago, explaining that the NNPC and its partners are building a number of trunk lines that will supply gas within the network.

According to the GCEO, within the next three to four years, there will likely be in-country gas infrastructure to raise supply, especially domestically.

""What we see is that we will probably need between $10 billion to $15 billion in two to three years. That should cover the immediate gap. And of course, looking beyond providing gas in the domestic market, which is to see how relationships and partnerships can create gas for export.

""And of course, when you look at that, and then probably you see another incremental $10 billion to $12 billion which will create the opportunity for growth,"" he stated.

Besides, the NNPC helmsman said that there is an ongoing engagement, which has reached a very advanced stage to create a pipeline that can pass through 13 African countries into Morocco and then to Europe, estimated at $25 billion.

He mentioned the ongoing construction of the NLNG Train 7, expressing the hope that it will likely double Nigeria's current capacity in the liquefied natural gas space when completed.

""Also, we are working on two other projects.

One is the fixed LNG project and we have reached an advanced stage of commitment so that we can bring back another 10 million tonnes facility in the country, and several other floating LNG projects.

""But obviously, we have a line of sight around at least three to four LNG projects. We are also engaging our partners to see how we can add another train on the LNG making it eight. We see huge opportunities,"" he pointed out.

Kyari further called for support from other countries to nations in sub-Saharan Africa, to close the energy availability gap.",arise.tv,news,Arise News,"Chioma Kalu, Ozioma Samuel-Ugwuezi, Nissi Gabriel, Melissa Enoch, Blessing Ibunge",0.07450980392156858,448967668,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.arise.tv/uploads/2023/11/Mele-Kyari.png,

This is what he meant.,"Only nine months after the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round playoff series sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2018, Anthony Davis submitted a trade request.

The Pelicans had won 48 games in 2017-18, the most in Davis' New Orleans tenure. In the 2018 offseason, the team signed Julius Randle. According to Randle, Davis did not make it a secret he was headed out the door.

Davis having his most success in a Pelicans uniform and then requesting a trade less than a year later was emblematic of New Orleans' history as a franchise up to that point: brief success followed by long fallow periods.

Since taking over in 2019, executive vice president David Griffin has talked about building something sustainable. In 2021, the Pelicans hired Willie Green to be their coach. Green immediately began talking about wanting to build a ""program.""

""A sustainable, winning culture,"" Green said. ""It feels like we are trending in a good way right now.""

Last week, the Pelicans picked up their 42nd win of the season in a beatdown of the Brooklyn Nets. That guaranteed the Pelicans consecutive seasons with a winning record for the second time in franchise history.

In 2007-08, Chris Paul finished runner-up in MVP voting and captained New Orleans to 56 wins. In 2008-09, Paul's Hornets won 49 games. New Orleans hadn't achieved back-to-back winning seasons since then until last week, when a team coached by Paul's friend and former teammate joined the club.

""We are trying to build starting with our foundation,"" Green said. ""It starts with the people we bring into our building. That contributes to having a healthy program. High-character people who bring a ton of energy. Who are hard workers. That's a program we are trying to build.""

Drafting well and developing talent in-house is critical to program-building. The 2021 draft was a turning point for the Pelicans. They swung a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies that involved them moving back from the No. 10 selection to No. 17. New Orleans chose Trey Murphy at that spot. In the second round, the Pelicans scooped up Herb Jones with the 35th pick. Later that night, the team signed Jose Alvarado as an undrafted free agent.

By the end of their rookie seasons, Murphy, Jones and Alvarado had all established themselves as rotation players for the Pelicans. Murphy is a flamethrower of a shooter who has already flirted with 50-40-90 efficiency marks. Jones is on the short list of the NBA's best perimeter defenders. Alvarado is an energy shifter and chaos creator who plays 6 inches taller than he actually is.

On Friday, the Pelicans beat the Miami Heat by 23 points even though they got a combined four points from their two best players. Brandon Ingram was unable to play after injuring his left knee in a nasty fall he took in Thursday's game. Zion Williamson, New Orleans' leading scorer, had a rare off night. He made two field goals.

The Pelicans won in dominant fashion anyway because they got 30 points from CJ McCollum, 45 points from their bench, and they played their usual style of high-energy, low-mistake defense. Alvarado and Naji Marshall -- two of New Orleans' undrafted finds -- combined to score 30 points.

""This is how you build a winning franchise,"" said Larry Nance Jr., who contributed six points and nine rebounds off the bench. ""Those franchises that go from low wins to 60 wins, that's not sustainable. You build a successful franchise, a successful roster, a successful team by steadily growing. Steady improvement.

By Feona Morrison

PRIME Minister, Brigadier (retired) Mark Phillips, has boldly declared that Guyana wants to lead the world in energy and climate security.

As he addressed the Guyana Energy Agency's (GEA) maiden EV [Electric Vehicle] Show and Tell exhibition on Saturday at Amazonia Mall, Providence, East Bank Demerara (EBD) he emphasised the importance of environmental stewardship and sustainable development in the face of global issues. He asserted that although fossil fuels will be available for another 30 years or so, Guyana needs to keep up with the global shift towards a greater usage of renewable energy sources.

Guyana now has 200 electric vehicles (EVs) with six charging stations, and the Prime Minister anticipates that number would rise to over 1,000 by 2025.

Furthermore, there are currently 50 persons trained to service these vehicles.

In an attempt to support national green energy initiatives, the Government of Guyana has made all imports of electric vehicles tax-free and duty free. There is also a 50 per cent annual write-down allowance for businesses investing in environmentally friendly vehicles.

These measures are consistent with the government's pledge to advance growth along a low-carbon route, the Prime Minister noted.

""Government is here to continue facilitating the move towards greater use of renewable energy with the use of electric vehicles in Guyana. It is my hope that by the end of 2025, we will pass 1,000 vehicles and I would like to contribute by purchasing an electric vehicle,"" said Phillips, who has oversight over the country's energy sector.

The increased use of electric vehicles will, in the opinion of Phillips, also help Guyana to gain more recognition as a global leader in climate and energy security.

""We want to be seen as the leader in energy security. And embracing renewable energy will not only see us as a leader in energy security, but [we] will also be seen as a leader in climate security...""

PM Phillips used the fact that there are more than 5,000 electric automobiles in the Dominican Republic to support his argument that these vehicles are getting more and more popular.

He added that Uganda has a comparable situation with regard to the adoption of electric vehicles for both private and public transportation.

Electric mobility is present in Guyana, according to Dr Mahender Sharma, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GEA.

Sharma, who has been driving an electric vehicle since 2020, mentioned that owning one has numerous advantages and is a wise investment.

Excited attendees eager to learn about and experience the future of automotive innovation filled the Amazonia Mall. Massay Motors showcased sleek electric vehicles that illustrated the advantages of moving away from conventional fossil fuel-powered modes of mobility.

During the event, a diverse range of electric vehicles, including those manufactured by MG Motor UK Limited, was showcased by Massy Motors.

Meletia Hossanah, the company's Marketing and Customer Service Manager, stated that these vehicles offer substantial financial and environmental benefits in addition to requiring less upkeep and operation than petrol-powered vehicles.

She said the vehicles come with home charging kits, enabling persons to conveniently charge their vehicles overnight at a fraction of the cost of traditional fueling. According to her, the company offers after sales support for all models.

Individuals from diverse backgrounds are embracing electric transportation and advocating for its benefits. Chrystal Persaud is one such individual who said, ""Electric vehicles are good for the environment as well as your pocket.""

According to Persaud, she contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions by driving an electric vehicle. She shared that her car is comfortable and has decent speed.

Even though battery depletion has limited her ability to travel long distances, Shanette Dey revealed that she still adores her car. ""I would marry my car if it were a man,"" she declared.

According to Samuel Chandool, he is pleased with his car. He explained that many people's misconceptions regarding electric vehicles stem from their worries about the battery.

Public charging stations for electric vehicles are available outside of the GEA office on Quamina Street, Georgetown; Giftland Mall, Pattensen, Greater Georgetown; Little Rock Suites in New Amsterdam, Berbice; Big Kiss Parking Lot in Parika, East Bank Essequibo (EBE); Amazonia Mall, Providence, EBD; and the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) at Timehri, EBD.

These public charging stations are currently under a three-months trial and testing phase supervised by GEA's engineers. Owners of electric vehicles can download the ""Flash Charge"" app, register, and charge their vehicles at these stations during this period for free.

After the three months is up, owners will have to pay $80 per kilowatt-hour, which according to the Prime Minister, is very affordable, compared to the rates in other Caribbean countries.",guyanachronicle.com,news,Guyana Chronicle,,0.4588235294117646,448967531,1,https://guyanachronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PM-1.jpg,eng-9417990

As spring arrives and the days get longer and the weather warmer, it's a great time to start getting your garden summertime ready - but according to the pro gardener, there's one mistake people are making with their grass.

As much as we all strive for a well-trimmed and pristine lawns, the pro suggests gardeners should avoid neatly cutting their grass for the first cut of the year. Ahead of this year's Ideal Home Show, David Domoney spoke to The Mirror to share his top tips when it comes to all things lawn care, reports the Mirror.

Knowing gardeners may be wiping off the cobwebs on their lawnmowers this weekend, David gave some top words of wisdom tip for the first cut. He urged green-fingered homeowners to leave some of your garden wild for the best results. ""Dandelions are a great food source for pollinators, so try to leave some areas a little wild to not cut out the positives and let them flourish,"" he explained.

Although many people class dandelions as weeds, the little yellow plants actually fertilise your grass. Instead of acting as a lawn killer, they work hard doing the opposite, as David highlighted, feeding birds, bees and butterflies. Their wide-spreading roots also help to loosen hard soil as well as aerate the earth.

David, a gardening expert, also had some advice for those who are too eager with their shears. ""The secret is to give it a high cut and not too short,"" he shared. After a soggy winter, David thinks we're set for a green-filled summer. He said: ""Spring is when the garden comes back to life, it hasn't been a cold winter but it has definitely been a wet winter so I think it will be a green summer, we are seeing a fluctuation nature and it's great.""

He also advised gardeners not to trim their grass when it's wet and suggested that the first cut should be done on a ""high setting"".

The Scottish Government has announced that tax reliefs at the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport will be extended to 2034.

The extension, by five years comes after Scottish Ministers backed proposals first set out in the UK government's Autumn Statement.

It will also apply to the Forth Green Freeport and prospective Investment Zones in Glasgow City Region and the North East of Scotland.

Green Freeports and the National Islands Plan were at the top of the agenda at a meeting of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands (CoHI) in Elgin on March 18.

CoHI is a meeting between the Scottish Government and its agencies, represented by the chairperson of each organisation.

It is held twice yearly and is hosted by a different local authority each time with the location alternating between a mainland and an island setting.

The Convention is intended to strengthen co-ordination between member organisations, the Scottish Government, and other representative bodies.

Ahead of the Convention, Deputy First Minister Shona Robison said: ""I am pleased that Scottish and UK Ministers have reached agreement on extending the tax reliefs window for Green Freeports, from 2029 to 2034.

""We strongly support firm joint action to ensure that the Green Freeports and prospective Investment Zones - and the landowners and businesses operating within them - all live up to a clear set of policy commitments, particularly in relation to our just transition to net zero and fair work principles.

""We continue to work constructively with the UK Government and the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport consortium to get the project up and running as quickly as possible and ensure it has maximum positive impact for businesses, communities and Scotland's wider economy.""",northern-times.co.uk,news,Northern Times,,0.2862745098039217,448967498,1,https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/CXEZ8BQG0E7WG3ILVNQU.jpg,

Physical space is often limited and staff turnover high, while client exit rates are low, especially in day activity centres (DACs) for those with higher support needs who cannot work.

The challenges are growing with the rising prevalence of autism, as those with this condition generally have moderate to higher support needs, said SPD chief executive Abhimanyau Pal.

Funding constraints also make it difficult to hire and retain trained professionals, especially in DACs, said Mr Bernard Chew, chief executive of St. Andrew's Autism Centre (SAAC). His organisation runs two such centres in Siglap and Sengkang which serve 124 persons with autism.

""It is a big concern for the families, and for society when the aged parents pass on,"" noted Jalan Besar GRC MP Denise Phua, who is president of the Autism Resource Centre and chairs Autism Association Singapore. ""We cannot afford to do business as usual.""

On March 6, it was announced that the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will add 500 DAC places and another 500 places to sheltered workshops by 2030. Sheltered workshops provide training or employment for persons with disabilities who can work, but are unable to take up open employment.

To start, 50 DAC places will be added at MINDS Jurong Training and Development Centre by 2025. About 100 sheltered workshop places will also be added to the APSN workshop at Kembangan-Chai Chee Community Hub in 2024.

There are currently eight sheltered workshops with a total capacity of 1,700 places, and 32 DACs with a total of 1,800 places.

As at December 2023, around 1,680 persons with disabilities were enrolled in sheltered workshops, and 1,560 persons were enrolled in DACs.

Some 190 people were waiting to enter sheltered workshops, while 250 people were on the waitlist to enter DACs.

The estimated wait time to enrol in a sheltered workshop ranges from six weeks to a year, while that for DACs ranges from one month to five years, according to service matrices on disability agency SG Enable's website.

One parent told The Sunday Times that his son's experience at a DAC changed drastically after the centre's supervisor and a coach he was familiar with both left.

The retiree, who wanted only to be known as Mr Robert, said his 37-year-old son Jonathan (not his real name) has autism and OCD, and had been in a DAC for the last eight years. After the new coach got frustrated with him, Jonathan refused to go to the DAC for five months.

Mr Robert wanted to pull Jonathan out of the centre, but was advised against doing so by other parents as it would be difficult to re-enter a DAC once he left.

He added that after the staff changes, he found the programmes less engaging and inflexible, even for minor changes such as teaching clients to bake a different flavour of cake.",straitstimes.com,news,The Straits Times,Shermaine Ang,-0.0117647058823529,448967498,1,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/03/24/DAC20clients20engaging20in20physical20exercises.JPG,

Due to fossil fuel consumption, the Earth's global mean temperature has risen 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. The rise increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods.

According to the 2024 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), issued by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network (CAN), this goal hinges on massive fossil fuel cuts, the biggest oil producers in the MENA region have been lagging behind on achieving the Paris Agreement goals.

The index monitors the environmental performance of the countries responsible for 92% of greenhouse gas emissions based on data aggregated up to two years prior to its release.

Overall, the index reports that climate action is waning in Arab countries, particularly in oil-producing ones, with Saudi Arabia ranking globally in the 67th place (last on the index), the UAE holding the 65th place, Algeria the 54th, and Egypt in the 22ndplace. Morocco scored best among Arab countries, ranking ninth globally.

Globally, the top three positions remained empty, as none of the countries evaluated took any action to adhere to the 1.5°C threshold. Denmark ranked at the top of the index, followed by Estonia in the fifth place, the Philippines, India, the Netherlands, Morocco, and Sweden coming in 10th.

The index assesses the performance of each country in four categories towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals: greenhouse gas emissions (accounting for 40% of the overall score), renewable energy (20%), energy use (20%), and climate policy (20%).

""Some countries fare well in individual categories, but none constantly scores high or very high"", says Jan Burck, senior advisor for low-carbon strategies and energy and project leader for climate indices at the NGO and Think Tank Germanwatch. He adds that accordingly, the averages are insufficient to adhere to the 1.5°C limit, and countries must step up their efforts.

Burck tells Nature Middle East that most Arab countries depend on fossil fuel for energy, which does not align with the 1.5°C limit. He point ed to Morocco as a positive example for Arab countries as it secured average scores in the categories of renewable energy and climate policy, but high scores in the categories of greenhouse gas emissions and energy use.

Egypt fell two places on this year's index, ranking 22nd, among average-performing countries on the index, with varying scores across the four major categories: scoring high on greenhouse gases emissions and energy use, low on climate policy, and very low on renewable energy.

Algeria fell six places compared to last year, ranking 54th among countries with very low performance, and scoring low on greenhouse gas emissions and climate policy, and very low on renewable energy.

The UAE was one of the ""lowest performing"" countries, and ranked very low in the categories of greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy use.

In last place, Saudi Arabia obtained a very low score in all four categories of the index.

Samir Mowafi, an environmental expert and former consultant to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, explains that the reliance of major and oil-producing and exporting countries on fossil fuels confirms that we are not on the right track to achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement.

Mowafi added that the statements made by major countries and oil producers about the necessity of reducing emissions and strongly shifting to renewable energy are empty promises.

Despite the importance of shifting towards renewable energy, some countries have morer pressing needs than others. Egypt, Mowafi says, for instance has a global emissions share of 0.73%, but is severely impacted by climate change.

""Even if Egypt completely switched to clean energy, this would not have a strong impact on reducing emissions, and this applies to the majority of developing countries,"" Mowafi says.

Noha Samir Donia, a professor of Irrigation and Environmental Hydraulics, and Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Environmental Research at Ain Shams University, agrees with Mowafi, and adds that the responsibility to reduce emissions falls heavier on oil-producing countries, especially in the Gulf.",natureasia.com,news,natureasia.com,,0.1058823529411765,448967496,1,https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/sliders/3453,

The new foreign exchange law will have a positive impact on Tunisia's relations with donors, particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has repeatedly called for reforms in the foreign exchange market, according to economic expert Moez Hadidane.

Indeed, Tunisia has made significant progress in liberalising the dinar, one of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in addition to capital liberalisation, he added in a video interview with TAP.

""This measure will have a positive impact on Tunisia's relations with donors, including the IMF, but the main reforms required relate in particular to the state budget and other areas such as subsidies and public enterprises,"" he said.

He added that the adoption of the foreign exchange law will help Tunisia to mobilise foreign currency and increase its reserves in the medium term.

""If we get the scenario right, as far as the provisions of the new code are concerned, Tunisia could mobilise the TND 1.9 billion that it would have received from the IMF, from Tunisian investors abroad and from international accounts,"" he said.

That's by design.

A statewide lottery is banned in Nevada's 159-year-old constitution. The constitution was written when lotteries were seen as corrupt and coincided with a series of national reforms, most famously abolition, that swept the United States in the 1800s.

""By the early 19th century, most lotteries were crooked. These lotteries were either not giving the prize, or being fixed,"" Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who specializes in Nevada and Las Vegas history, told the Washington Examiner.

The casino industry has made sure statewide lotteries have remained banned, and neighboring states such as California and Arizona are reaping the benefits while locals miss out. However, a change to the ban may be within reach.

In 2023, Assemblyman Cameron ""C.H."" Miller introduced an amendment to enact a statewide lottery, with revenue from the lottery allocated to mental health funding.

""This constitutional amendment authorizing a lottery and dedicating the revenue to funding for youth mental health is a common sense solution that will help the many Nevada youth who are battling mental health challenges, just like I did as a child,"" Miller said.

""Right now, we are sending millions of dollars across the border to neighboring states. It is time to fully invest in Nevadans and pass this constitutional amendment,"" he said. Mississippi, the most recent state to enact a statewide lottery, has seen $488 million generated since 2019, all dedicated to the state's Department of Transportation and Department of Education.

The road to the amendment may be bumpy, though. Since 1975, there have been 30 failed attempts at amending the state's constitution to enact the lottery. The casino industry, one of the state's most powerful entities, has long posed a barrier to the change.

The casino industry says ""there's not really a lot of creation of jobs and economic development"" in statewide lotteries, Mark Nichols, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies the gaming industry, told the Washington Examiner. The casino industry is the largest employer in Las Vegas, the state's population center.

""That would take away from the gaming industry's ability to do what it does best, which is to create new jobs and generate new revenue for the states, so it would come at the expense of something else,"" Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resorts Association, said on the topic of a statewide lottery in 2016.

Nichols said that argument only works to a certain extent, as many games within casinos and in places such as grocery stores, bars, and airports across Nevada also don't require someone to man them.

""Grocery stores, convenience stores, pretty much most bars have slot machines in them as well,"" Nichols said. ""But those don't create a lot of jobs, don't create a lot of economic development. People don't travel across the country to do that and say, 'Hey, let's go to that 7/11 and play.'""

""Everyone's operating already in states where there are lotteries. They're doing fine. They're doing well,"" Miller said. ""The operation of a lottery could compete with their business, and it's my position that it shouldn't be a competition. We can be partners together.""

Still, based on other states with both legalized gambling and lotteries, there seems to be little competition between the two, such as in Massachusetts.

""In Massachusetts, we actually had lottery data at the outlet level, so we knew what every single store in Massachusetts sold as far as lottery tickets,"" Nichols said. ""We looked at what happened to lottery sales after casinos in Massachusetts opened, and really we did not see any kind of decrease in lottery sales whatsoever.""

He said they examined individual store data near casinos and found that industries had no effect on each other's sales.

Nicols said the lottery entices people because casinos don't offer games with such high winnings for such a low dollar amount bet. Nichols also said Nevadans are aware of the ins and outs of gaming like scratch cards, which are also small-dollar buy-ins, but low earnings as compared to the lottery.

""Most people that gamble, particularly that gamble regularly and live in Nevada, they know that they're probably not going to be too enticed to play scratch cards,"" Nichols said.

A lottery would then be mostly bought by residents, not people traveling to Nevada to gamble because they can likely buy a lottery ticket in their home state.

""Tourists might make it part of their experience. I'm not sold on its importance to tourism, since it's available elsewhere,"" Green said.

Without having a statewide lottery, Nevada is losing out on millions of dollars of sales to neighboring states.

A 2016 report showed a lotto store in the California-Nevada border town of Primm, 30 minutes south of Las Vegas with a population of 1,000, sold $13 million worth of lottery tickets in a single year. That road that divides the two states is called ""Lotto Store Road.""

""There's a store that's right here on the border; it's 10 miles from where I'm sitting, and that's, I think, one of California's best outlets for lottery sales,"" Nichols said. ""The border literally goes right down the middle of the store. So, on one side, you can buy lottery tickets, and on one side, you can use slot machines.""

It'll be a long and uphill battle for Miller's amendment legalizing a statewide lottery. The legislature would have to vote again on the bill in 2025. Then the law would be put on a ballot for a statewide vote. The earliest estimate places the vote on a 2027 ballot.",conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,-0.1058823529411764,448967295,1,https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/powerball-1024x594.jpg,

Ukrainian sources however report that Russia's amphibious landing ships Yamal and Azov were hit, along with the communications centre and infrastructure facilities of the Black Sea Fleet.

Some reports say Belbek military airfield at Sevastopol has also been struck, with three SU-27 aircraft damaged or destroyed.

More than 30 Russian military personnel have been reported killed, with more injured.

Following the missile attack, transportation services to and from the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, are also experiencing disruptions.

The transport administration of the region, overseen by Moscow, announced the suspension of sea and road connections between Russia's mainland and Crimea for several hours.

The events unfolded in Sevastopol, a strategically significant port city located on the Crimean Peninsula, where tensions between Russia and Ukraine have persisted since the annexation in 2014.

The statement provided by Razvozhayev, while confirming the interception of missiles and the resulting impact on the city, did not specify the origin or motive behind the attack.

The suspension of transportation services underscores the immediate repercussions of such incidents on the daily lives of residents in the Russian occupied region's connectivity with the mainland.

The disruption in transportation links adds to the challenges faced by the Crimean Peninsula, which has been subject to international sanctions and isolation following Russia's annexation.

Efforts to restore normalcy following the incident are underway, with authorities working to assess the extent of the damage and ensure the safety of residents.

The incident serves as a reminder of the volatility in the region and the potential for escalation amid unresolved tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

As investigations into the incident continue, both Russia and Ukraine are likely to closely monitor developments and assess the implications for regional security.

The incident further complicates the already strained relationship between the two countries and underscores the need for diplomatic efforts to address underlying grievances and reduce tensions in the region.

Russia annexed the territory from Ukraine in 2014.

He said that there exists significant interest among entrepreneurs who are eager to capitalize on opportunities within the space sector.

Sebastian Buckup further stated that establishing a 'space public infrastructure' in India could potentially trigger a surge in space entrepreneurship. During his visit to India, Buckup held meetings with various stakeholders in the space sector, including representatives from INSPACe, and ISRO, as well as emerging and established space enterprises.

Last week, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), an initiative by the World Economic Forum (WEF), inaugurated its space technology program in India. The initiative aims to foster international partnerships among diverse stakeholders as the private space sector gains momentum in the country.

""I think many people outside of India are still describing India as an emerging space nation. The reality is that India has arrived in the top section of space actors, and there is an opportunity to shift the narrative and help the world understand what India has really achieved,"" he said.

Buckup highlighted that India's advancements in the space sector also offer an opportunity to disseminate its finest practices and accomplishments.

Regarding future trends in the space industry, Buckup said that the sector would soon evolve into a trillion-dollar industry, with nearly every company showing some interest in space-related endeavours.

""I think it is fair to say that at some point, every economy will become a space economy, and every company will become a space company. So, these economies and these companies should be ready for that,"" he said.

He also emphasized that the increasing interest in the space sector would lead to reduced costs and stimulate innovation, resulting in economic and societal benefits.

Marilyne Pereira Goncalves, Senior Financial Sector Specialist with the World Bank says this should worry us all.

She observes that every year, criminals make millions of dollars by illegally harvesting and trafficking our planet's natural resources. Their crimes cover a wide range of activities, from illegal logging to poaching and trafficking of endangered species, illegal mining, and waste trafficking.

According to Goncalves, while the environmental crimes themselves often occur in developing and resource-rich countries, criminals tend to move and launder their profits globally.

""They often rely on a mix of front companies and corrupt actors to move criminal profits undetected,"" she notes Experts have found that environmental crimes need to be found for our own survival. Uganda has not been speared of crimes like illicit logging, poaching of wildlife like elephant tusks and pangolin scales among others.

According to Wild Aid, in recent years, Uganda has fought hard to reduce wildlife poaching within its borders and to reverse its reputation as a hotspot for the smuggling and trafficking of illegal wildlife products to Asia. All wild animal species are protected under Ugandan law and a new wildlife act introduced in 2019 sets out extreme prison and monetary penalties for wildlife crimes.

Goncalves says environmental crimes have huge human costs; indeed, the survival of our planet could depend on how effectively we can tackle the threat. ""Yet, till now, these types of crimes have been given lesser importance than other financial crimes, such as tax crimes or fraud,"" she said.

She observes that we spend millions of dollars on solutions for climate change, but most countries spend next to nothing on recovering the proceeds of climate-related crimes.

""This is important as following the money often helps identify and bring down the wider networks and kingpins behind these crimes,"" suggests Goncalves In recent years, there has been increased attention on the global need to follow the money from environmental crimes.

Part of those efforts resulted in the passing of the Uganda Wildlife Act in 2019. The significantly strengthening penalties for wildlife crime.

In 2022, Uganda handed down its first life sentence to an illegal ivory dealer, in the famous Ochiba Pascal landmark case before The Standards, Utilities, and Wildlife Court case.

The Court convicted Ochiba Pascal for unlawful possession of protected species after being found in possession of two pieces of elephant ivory weighing 9.55 kilograms without a wildlife use right.

This week, the European Union removed Uganda from the anti-money laundering blacklist by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It said Uganda had improved in Ati-money laundering nod Counter-terrorism. FATF also works in fighting money laundering from environmental crimes and raises awareness about the financial flows that fuel crimes such as illegal logging.

According to FATF's former President, Marcus Pleyer, environmental crime is one of the most profitable criminal enterprises. It covers a wide range of unlawful activities such as illegal logging, illegal wildlife trade, and waste trafficking.

""Neither crime nor finance are limited to national borders, so to achieve our goals on tackling illicit finance we need to work with all countries,"" he said.

In February this year, FATF's urged for the implementation of recommendation 25 on the beneficial ownership and transparency of legal arrangements in to enhance transparency of beneficial ownership globally and prevent criminals and terrorists from hiding their activities and funds behind complex corporate structures and legal arrangements such as trusts.

Beneficial owner refers to the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls an entity and/or the natural person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted

Experts have found that environmental crimes are usually mixed with legal activities to hide its illicit character. They say banks (Financial Institutions) can play an important role here, as they are part of international trade through provided services.

As an example, in 2022 the Basel Ant-Money Landering Index (AML) added environmental crime data to its indicators of money laundering and terrorist financing. This indicator had 5% weighting and is based on the Global Organized Crime Index, measuring risks connected to environmental crimes and first published in 2021.

In 2020 and 2021, the German and Chinese Presidencies to the FATF prioritized this issue and developed two public reports for countries on how to detect and investigate the laundering of money from environmental crimes. Goncalves notes that while this was an important step, the topic has since fallen out of the policy spotlight.

""The real challenge now is how to get countries to regain and maintain this momentum and translate it into action on the ground,""

In August last year, WildAid said East Africa's ports are on the frontline in the fight against illegal wildlife trafficking. It said products from all over Africa pass through the region on their way to Asia and other destinations. It called on efforts to sensitize port workers about the value of wildlife to their countries if they are to fight environmental crime. Smuggled wildlife products are normally concealed in illegal shipments.

What Needs to be Done?

For this to happen, there needs to be a coordinated effort from governments, the FATF, and the public itself. Marilyne Pereira Goncalves suggests that countries need to bring financial crime and anti-money laundering expertise into public-policy dialogue on environmental protection and climate change.

""In most countries, there has been very little coordination between agencies responsible for money-laundering prevention and those responsible for environmental protection,"" she said.

according to Goncalves, case studies show that criminals involved in environmental crimes often launder their profits in plain sight, using legal markets to mix legal and criminal proceeds. And that criminals misuse the same Anti-Money Laundering weaknesses as fraudsters or tax criminals, who rely on gaps in information on ultimate owners behind companies and weak international cooperation.

""This highlights the need for both developed and developing countries to address long-standing gaps in their AML frameworks and ensure that AML experts partner with a wider range of public and private sector partners to detect anomalies,"" she urged.

Goncalves further suggests that the public has an important role to play in helping to ensure environmental crimes are treated seriously and that criminals are sanctioned. This includes encouraging public sector efforts to strengthen expertise in this area, and actions to follow and recover criminal gains from such crimes.",independent.co.ug,news,The Independent Uganda:,,-0.3254901960784313,448966795,1,https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/elephant-1.jpg,

Yet the 18 candidates running for president on Sunday have largely ignored the country's pressing environmental situation.

During the rainy season from July to November, ""the sea gets bigger and bigger and you can't get through,"" Diatta said.

""And we can no longer farm the rice fields because of the salt water.""

Diatta's family has lived on the surrounding Kafountine islands for centuries, but they now fear being forced from their homes.

""The water is advancing and threatening the village. The trees are dying. If this continues, we'll have no choice but to leave, but where will we go?"" said Louise Diatta, in her 40s, who wants her children to grow up on her native island.

Like many countries along the West African coast, Senegal is on the front lines of climate change.

Coastal erosion linked to rising sea levels, drought, desertification and flooding have affected large swathes of the population, with some communities in the north already displaced.

Most presidential candidates made some mention of the environment in their manifestos, a marked change from previous years.

But concrete measures to tackle global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions were relegated far behind issues such as justice, employment and the renegotiation of hydrocarbon contracts.

Recently discovered reserves of oil and gas have raised hopes of future industrialisation, with production due to begin this year.

- 'Urgent action' -

Senegal's coastline is receding by an average of between one and 1.3 metres a year, according to official figures from 2020.

At this rate, around 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 square miles) of low-lying areas would be flooded by 2100, with a sea level rise of one metre.

But the mayor of the southern town of Kafountine, David Diatta, said the phenomenon in his locality was happening much faster than these projections.

Rising waters are already making startling inroads in the town, which is home to around 40,000 people.

Even at the height of the dry season, the road linking the centre with the quays to reach the Kafountine islands is submerged.

Formerly buried electricity cables and pipes supplying drinking water are now exposed to the rising waves.

A half-collapsed petrol station and a former tourist site have also fallen prey to the advancing sea.

And the dock where hundreds of fishermen, fishmongers and vendors work has begun its descent into the water.

""The situation is very worrying and requires urgent action,"" the mayor told AFP.

- High stakes -

""If the fishing dock disappears, thousands of jobs will be lost. If the tourist infrastructure disappears, hundreds and thousands of jobs will disappear,"" Diatta added.

This is a worrying prospect at a local level, in a country where unemployment already stands at 20 percent.

In the historic northern city of Saint-Louis, the government aided by foreign partners in 2019 began constructing a 3.6-kilometre seawall to combat rising water levels.

But further south in Kafountine, Diatta said that local authorities did not have the means to cope, with the thousands of sandbags placed along the coastline offering little protection from the ocean.

""We need real political will on the part of the central government. We're going to take our concerns to whoever is elected president to find solutions,"" Diatta said.

He decried the government's slow response to the situation and the lack of interest shown by the majority of presidential candidates.

Aissatou Diouf, head of advocacy at the NGO Enda Energie, said that most hopefuls in the race only mentioned environmental issues in an ""abstract"" way.

""We need to go beyond 'we have to protect the environment,'"" she said.

""How can we do this? With what technology? What kind of investment? What kind of financing? What kind of vision?"" she said, listing the pressing issues.

""How will the programme fit in with Senegal's international commitments to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius?""

Economic and development projects should also include an environmental dimension, Diouf added, given the urgency of the situation and the ""enormous"" stakes for the Senegalese people.",terradaily.com,news,Terra Daily,,-0.2470588235294118,448966617,1,https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/climate-spix-hg.jpg,eng-9421380

The symbolic ""lights off"" is back as part of the global Earth Hour campaign that seeks to engage people and create awareness about the Earth and the environment.

""Lights off"" was started by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), an international nongovernmental organization working in wilderness preservation and the environment, as a symbolic event to keep the lights off in Sydney in 2007, has turned into a major catalyst to promote the environmental protection movement.

More than ""410,000 hours were given"" to the planet last year by supporters in over 190 countries and territories, according to the campaign.

The annual campaign brought as many people as possible together, asking them to switch off at 8.30 p.m. local time and spend 60 minutes doing something positive for the planet as the world is now at a ""tipping point"" with climate and nature crises.

""WWF's Earth Hour is a moment of global unity that brings people from all over the world together, shines a spotlight on the climate and nature crisis and inspires people to act and advocate for urgent change,"" a spokesperson for the WWF U.K. told Anadolu Agency (AA).

Touching on the U.K., when it comes to nature, the spokesperson said nature and concerns about climate change and the environment are a top issue for the public in Britain.

As part of this year's campaign, many renowned landmarks supported Earth Hour by going dark and switching off lights, including the London Eye and the four Tate Museums in London, Liverpool and Cornwall.

Additionally, BFI IMAX, Piccadilly Lights, Westfield, Historical Royal Palaces and Buckingham Palace, also switched off all lights on those premises in support of the campaign.

In Istanbul, Salt Galata, a culture complex which is located in the old headquarters of the Ottoman Bank also switched its lights off.

""Small actions can make a big difference, so we can't wait to see how many people get involved this year and give an hour for Earth to help bring our world back to life,"" the spokesperson added in written comments.

On the importance of environmental campaigns, although global security challenges and conflicts are among the world's top agenda items, the WWF cited a report that revealed global wildlife population sizes have declined 69% on average since 1970, and Britain has become ""one of the most nature-depleted countries"" in the world.

""Never has it been more important to show our leaders we must tackle the nature and climate crisis with urgent action,"" according to the WWF statement that was sent in response to a question by Anadolu Agency (AA).

The campaign has a series of recommendations for those taking part in the campaign during the day, including going outside and ""make your outdoor space more nature friendly.""

For those who will be at work, it suggested screening the WWF's ""Save Our Wild Isles business films,"" while discussing how your workplace can be part of the solution.

Cooking a ""sustainable meal"" is a suggestion for participants who will also be asked to take the flagship step by switching off to be a ""part of a movement of millions of people around the world.""

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres defined Earth Hour as a ""global show of solidarity with our planet.""

""Let's turn off the lights and turn the world towards a brighter future for us all,"" he said.

Among them was the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin where the lights went off as part of a global movement that encourages nations to switch off their lights at 8:30 p.m. local time for an hour to bring attention to the issues of nature loss and climate change.

In Germany, alongside highlighting environmental issues, the event sought to comment on the political climate.

""The current zeitgeist is tense. Crises, conflicts and wars are keeping people very busy,"" said Viviane Raddatz, head of climate at WWF Germany, in the run-up to the event.

""This year, we want to use Earth Hour as a moment for each other, for our planet, and show that we are united: We stand up for more climate protection, for mutual respect, for democracy.""

She said this year's darkening of the monument was a way of taking a stand against a shift to the right and associated denial of climate catastrophes.

Other monuments worldwide from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Opera House and the Empire State Building in New York, the Colosseum in Rome, the Croatian State Archives building in Zagreb, the Burj Khalifa building in the United Arab Emirates and many other landmarks were taking part in Earth Hour.

In implementation of the Industry Ministry's leadership directives, to review the price , supply conditions, and to evaluate the performance of the control teams affiliated with the offices of industry and trade.

He stressed the continuation of field visits to include all directorates under the supervision of the internal trade sector, ensuring compliance with price lists and protecting the citizen from any attempts at fraud or monopoly.

Al-Khawlani pointed out that the campaign will gradually target the markets of the districts, from those with dense population and large commercial activities to the smaller districts, while the committees in the city centers will move from the main streets to the sales outlets inside the neighborhoods.

For his part, the Director of Consumer Protection at the Ministry of Industry, Abdullah Sharaf, indicated that field reports confirm commitment to price notification and price lists, in addition to the existence of supply stability.

He stated that the field committees are working to address any violations in the field, while issuing violation records, and giving violators a period to correct the violations.

EV push: Indian auto industry players have listed a host of electric vehicle models over the coming few years amid the government's revived drive for boosting environment-friendly mobility solutions with the rollout of a new framework.

Mass market automakers including Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have new models in the pipeline over the years which accommodate the sectoral demand.

Beginning January next year, Mahindra & Mahindra will launch five new battery electric vehicles over the coming time, according to CEO of their Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he said.

Maruti Suzuki is also making significant investments in the electric vehicle segment, according to their India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he pointed.

But for curbing the import of carbon and oil, Bharti noted that the country will need several more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

Maruti Suzuki introduced its premium electric SUV, the IONIQ 5 in 2023.

He noted that several industry estimates project electric vehicles to comprise around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

Maruti Suzuki intends to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu, which also includes the setting up of a battery assembly plant in the state.

Tata Motors has ambitions to roll out 10 EVs by 2026, a company spokesperson said. The automaker arm of salts to steel company Tata Group has a strategy to bring forth four more EV models in 2024, which comprise of Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also setting in motion plans to boost their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" according to a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

Consumer choices and the economic climate will decide the pace of BEV transition,""the spokesperson stated.

Audi India anticipates 50 per cent of its sales in India to be from electric vehicles by 2030. The automaker, which has four electric models in the country, has expansion plans for its product range to reach its zealous sales target.

Earlier in March, the government gave its assent on an electric-vehicle policy, as part of which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of $500 million, aimed at attracting global behemoths like Elon Musk's Tesla.

Gollagunta of Mahindra & Mahindra said the policy bolsters the Make in India momentum, with a need for bank guarantees, minimum investment dedication and value addition locally to boost India's EV ecosystem.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",irishsun.com,news,Irish Sun,,0.3098039215686275,448966153,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

It was aimed at catalysing the participation of women in the logistics sector, a critical component of the nation's Viksit Bharat Vision 2047, it added.

Rajeev Singh Thakur, Additional Secretary, DPIIT, who highlighted the importance of gender diversity for the growth and innovation of the logistics industry, set the tone for the day's deliberations, focusing on actionable insights and collaborative efforts.

The consultation brought together over 50 professionals from a diverse group, which included industry associations, MSMEs, large enterprises, skill training institutes, academia, and bilateral and multilateral institutes, to discuss and strategize the way forward for gender inclusivity in logistics, according to the statement.

The event underscored the importance of creating a supportive ecosystem that encourages and facilitates the involvement of women at all levels of the logistics chain.

The discussion dissected various challenges hindering women's entry and retention in the logistics workforce. Topics ranged from infrastructural barriers to the need for policy reforms that prioritise women's safety, training, and professional growth, the ministry's statement read.

The discussions also shed light on the untapped potential of women in driving innovation and efficiency in logistics. Success stories and best practices from around the globe, illustrating the transformative impact of women's increased involvement in the sector, were also shared.

Going forward, the study will undertake extensive feedback from all the relevant stakeholders to prepare a roadmap for creating an enabling environment for increasing women workforce participation in the logistics sector.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic - some say goofy-looking - mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

'Moose are newcomers to North America,' said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

'Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,' McKee said. 'And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.'

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

'Why a moose hunt at all?' Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. 'We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.'

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character Bullwinkle made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

'I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,' Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

FILE - In this photo provided by the Nevada Department of Wildlife, biologists take a picture with a moose they collared in Elko County, Nev., during NDOW's first-ever moose collaring project, in 2020.

'It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,' said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Standing 1.8 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 453.5 kilograms, moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 20 Celsius.

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that 'thermal threshold' was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 805 kilometers from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

'There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,' McKee said. 'Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?'

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s, but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but 'conservative is the name of the game here.'

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as 'slim and none' to draw a moose tag.

'For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,' he said.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.05098039215686279,448966061,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260306.jpg,eng-9421227

Hylio, a Texas-based drone manufacturer, successfully applied for an exemption from the FAA to allow fleets of drones weighing 55 pounds or more to fly together.

It's the first exception of its kind for machines that carry what the company calls a ""meaningful payload"" and makes the process competitive with traditional tractors and seeding rigs.

""On average, you're spending a quarter both up front, capital cost to buy the machinery, and operating cost is about a quarter or maybe a third of what you'd spend for the traditional stuff,"" Arthur Erickson, Hylio's CEO, told Fox News Digital.

Even a set of three drones costs substantially less than a single tractor. They use less water to carry chemicals, causing less soil compaction, and only a fraction of the fuel for generators to recharge batteries in the field. And Hylio doesn't charge a subscription fee for its software, Erickson said.

Under previous rules, a single drone required a pilot and another person acting as a spotter. Because of weight limitations in flight, it took a long time to cover large fields.

Now the two-person team can fly up to three drones at once in a ""swarm,"" covering triple the area in the same time, making it almost as fast as a conventional tractor.

TRACTOR HACK: FARMERS ARE HARNESSING HACKED SOFTWARE FOR JOHN DEERE REPAIRS

Andy Kreikemeier, a Nebraska farmer behind Infinity Precision Ag, says he began using drones about six months ago, primarily in hard-to-reach places.

In addition to the pilot and the spotter, his operation also includes a third person to refill the drone.

""Now we can run three drones with two people with this exemption,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""So, not only are we increasing our coverage time frame with using three drones, but we're lessening the time and the amount of people we have to have on site.""

With another pilot and another tracker, he could run a fleet of six drones at the same time and cover even more ground without running over crops or compacting more soil under the wheels.

Drones begin at around $50,000 per unit, according to Hylio. A conventional tractor can cost more than $300,000, with some high-end models going for over $700,000.

""They're so expensive,"" Erickson said. ""Over half a million for a brand-new tractor these days, while we're still reeling from the COVID stuff, supply train issues.""

Kreikemeier said he paid about $80,000 each for his fully-loaded drones from Hylio.

The machines have a multitude of uses, Erickson said.

According to the United Nations, women have the highly specialized knowledge of forests from species diversity, management of resources, to conservation and restoration practices that are vital to sustainable development and food security.

In the Philippines, while the Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Plan (GEWE Plan) 2019-2025 exists, challenges related to gender disparities in the industry remain.

The Philippine Commission on Women reports that women in the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sectors constitute only about 25% of the workers and face marginalization in employment, pay, and resource access.

For its part, LivE shared insights on how local organizations can address these problems and give women the right avenue to excel in sustainability and conservation.

LivE emphasized the importance of training sessions addressing women's rights in forest management.

In one of its sessions that tackled challenges about health, domestic responsibilities, production roles, and social engagement and their link to environmental strains, 52-year-old Rita Wati, a native of Kerinci Seblat National Park and now chairperson of ""Women's Group for Environmental Care Maju Bersama"" emerged as a driving force behind conservation efforts.

Wati experienced skepticism from being a woman in a male-dominated field but still persevered and pushed for a proposal that allowed her organization to be involved in managing and conserving Indonesia's Kerinci Seblat National Park.

She inked a historic conservation partnership agreement with the national park, marking Maju Bersama group as the pioneering women's group managing a forest area in Indonesia.

""It's truly a joy. Inspired by our progress, now, women in many villages are no longer silent. They are ready to move together to fight for women's rights to the environment and forests,"" said Rita.

Ukraine has suffered a second day of intense bombing of its power stations, plunging half a dozen regions into darkness, as the Kremlin tries to take advantage of Kyiv's dwindling supply of air defence ammo.

At the same time, the US asked Zelenskiy's administration to curb its long-distance drone strikes on Russia's oil refineries, as production has dropped by 10% since the start of the year, threatening an oil product price strike ahead of US elections slated for this November.

On the night of March 21-22, Russian forces launched a combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine's critical infrastructure using a total of 151 aerial weapons that cost well over $300mn, according to reports.

Ukrainian air defence units managed to destroy 92 Russian aerial targets, but an increasing number of Russian missiles are getting through to hit their targets as Ukraine starts to run low on air defence ammo. Blackouts not seen for about a year were back as important power plants were struck and suffered major damage.

Emergency power outages are taking place in a number of Ukrainian regions after reports of damage to power generating facilities, the Ukrainian energy holding DTEK and regional authorities reported.

Blackouts have been reported in eight regions, including the Dnipro Region and in the Kyiv-controlled areas of the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as ""stabilisation outages"" in the Odesa Region.

According to the regional authorities, over 110,000 residents of the Poltava Region will be disconnected ""to balance the power grid"", while in the Sumy Region emergency cut-off plans will be implemented in several districts.

It appears that the Kremlin is trying to take advantage of Kyiv's increasingly dire financial state after the US ran out of money for Ukraine in January and halted supplies of badly needed weapons and ammo. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Western leaders last week to urgently send more munitions, but the Ministry of Finance (MinFin) admitted last week that Ukraine has only received 10% of the arms and cash promised last month at the 20 Ramstein meeting.

The barrage began on March 21, hitting cities across the country. A Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia on March 22 claimed the lives of three people: a father and daughter aged 35 and 8, and a 62-year-old trolleybus driver who was driving along the dam of the Dnipro hydroelectric power plant (HPP), the Kyiv Independent reports.

The target was the Dnipro HPP, a major source of power, which was struck by eight missiles and suffered extensive damage.

Ukraine is currently suffering from the most intense missile and drone attack since the start of the war more than two years ago - even more intense than the first barrage launched in January designed to run Ukrainian's stock of defensive missiles down, a tactic that now seems to be paying dividends for Russia.

Russian forces are exploiting Ukraine's air defence shortages to plunge the country into darkness and destroy the country's energy grid in the largest strike since the start of the conflict, according to a report from Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

More than 130 energy infrastructure facilities have been targeted across the country over the last two days. The Dnipro HPP is the largest facility in Ukraine and was a key target, but dozens of other power stations have also been hit and damaged, according to reports.

The Dnipro HPP is now reported to be in a critical condition after its turbine room and electrical equipment were seriously damaged, director Igor Sirota reportedly said.

""We are losing the station. The HPP-2 is in danger. We don't know at what capacity it will be able to operate. The HPP-2 is in critical condition. The HPP-1 has also stopped operations, so we are doing everything we can to raise the gates and process the water,"" Ukraine's Strana media outlet quoted him as saying.

""We will have to fully rebuild the turbine room and repair electrical equipment,"" he added, noting that there was no threat of a dam break.

The current onslaught has sent residents of cities around Ukraine scuttling back into air raid shelters that haven't been much used since the last assault on Ukraine's power infrastructure in the winter of 2022.

The air defences provided by the US and European allies have proved so effective that bne IntelliNews' correspondent in Kyiv reported the locals had become increasingly blasé about air raid siren alerts, often choosing to ignore them and continue going about their business. But that has changed dramatically in the few last days as the combination of falling levels of ammo and the sheer intensity of the attack have driven people underground again.

The skies are open again to a Russian assault that threatens to repeat the destruction of half the country's energy infrastructure, as occurred in the winter 2022 campaign. The Washington Post recently reported that the shortage of air defence ammo has become so acute that Kyiv may soon be limited to being able to shoot down only one in five inbound missiles.

""Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in early spring 2024 likely aim to collapse the energy grid in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its (defence-industrial base),"" the ISW said.

With international supplies of weapons falling off, Ukraine's strategy is to become a military production hub and make more of the arms and ammo it needs at home. Depriving Ukraine of power will make that task a lot harder.

Ukraine launched a counter-punch in February that is also designed to run down Russia's ability to supply its forces and earn money to run its war machine by targeting Russia's oil refineries with long-range missiles.

However, the Financial Times reported last week that the US has urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, warning senior SBU and GUR officials that drone strikes risk driving up global oil prices and provoking retaliation.

Russia crude oil refining production has dropped to a ten-month low and is down at 5mn barrels per day (bpd) from March 14-20, or a 10% fall year on year. after Ukraine began a drone war in February using new long-range domestically produced drones to attack Russia's refining capacity deep inside Russian territory.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak denied that Washington had called on Kyiv to halt the drone strikes on Russian assets.

""This is fictitious information. After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for waging this war. Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of warfare. Fuel is the basic tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy its fuel infrastructure,"" Podolyak said as cited by Ukrayinska Pravda.

Podolyak argued that Russia is in the midst of a major attack against Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure with genocidal intentions, while Ukraine has responded with its own attacks against the Russian infrastructure of war.

Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, followed up saying that Russia's oil refineries are ""legitimate targets of Ukraine from a military point of view."" According to her, Ukraine is acting in accordance with Nato standards in this case, in statements that defy the US concerns.

""We understand the requests of American partners. But we wage war with the capabilities, resources and practices that are available to us,"" she said during the second Ukrainian Security Forum.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on his Nato allies to ""close the skies"" from the very first week of the war, but Nato has never responded, leaving Ukraine vulnerable to missile attacks. The supply of sophisticated anti-missile systems, and the US-made Patriot system in particular - have alleviated the problem somewhat, but the Patriot missiles are expensive and in short supply, whereas Russia has ramped up the production of cheap weaponised drones that it is firing at Ukraine in their droves.

Commenting on the hostile attack by the Russians on March 22, Stefanishyna welcomed the words of support from Ukraine's Western allies, but words alone are insufficient, given the scale and intensity of the current attack.

""I want to draw attention to the fact that the situation is already very bad... Over the past two months we have received 10% of the planned financial resources necessary for the survival of the state, and also have not received military assistance, which was planned for almost a year within the Ramstein format by more than 50 countries around the world,"" Stefanishyna said.

With cruise operators set to start contributing to the European Union's emissions trading program, the global Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, wants ""countries to be able to reinvest all, or at least some, of this extra revenue into infrastructure,"" Europe Director General Marie-Caroline Laurent said in an interview.

The sums are not inconsiderable.

Europe's cruise sector is slated to contribute more than $655 million to the emissions program, known as ETS, starting in 2026, Laurent said.

But at least part of that total would be better used if it were redeployed toward clean infrastructure for the industry -- in areas from reduced emissions at berth and at sea, to programs for sustainable facilities at destination ports, Laurent said.

Infrastructure is a ""key concern,"" Laurent said, as electrification of ports and refueling facilities will be essential for the industry's future.

Few industries have faced a tougher post-pandemic challenge than cruise lines. Even after a sharp rally last year, shares have yet to snap back to pre-pandemic highs. Non-fuel costs -- fleet maintenance, food and onboard services -- are also expected to rise in coming quarters.

Currently about half of the industry's vessels are set up for next-generation shore-side electricity, Laurent said. That puts the onus on ports to update facilities.

""We obviously need the ports to be equipped with the newest outlets and to have electrification capability,"" she said.

For a possible model, Laurent pointed to the aviation sector, where sustainable SAF fuel is rated zero-emission and doesn't count toward emissions calculations.

For cruise operators, ""this kind of mechanism would be a good way to accelerate the deployment of alternative fuels,"" Laurent said.",arkansasonline.com,news,ArkansasOnline,,0.07450980392156858,448965990,1,https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/206809042_cruise_3FGRN77AVVHWPMDIRUOQO7M4X4_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676,

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.3098039215686275,448965989,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

In a year, approximately 140,000 employment-based green cards are authorised, but only a maximum of 7% of these are granted to individuals from a country. A backlog is created should the number of sponsored individuals from a particular country exceed the 7% limit.

Huge backlogs have been created mainly for immigrants from India and China because of these country-specific caps. In fact, over one million people are waiting in America due to employment-based green card backlogs. These people include dependent spouses and children.

In a post that reads, ""Every month DoS shamelessly publishes cut off dates that separate Chinese and Indian born from Rest of the World,"" Musk has now commented, ""Yup, super racist"".

The Managing Director and Chief Executive of the NDIC, Mr. Bello Hassan gave the pledge during a courtesy visit of the NDIC Management to the Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ola Olukoyede at the EFCC Headquarters in Abuja. An NDIC statement issued by Director, Communication & Public Affairs Bashir Nuhu quoted Hassan saying NDIC plays a critical role in combating financial crimes within the banking sector through its mandate which includes bank supervision and liquidation of licensed banks.

The ultimate objective, he added, is to protect depositors' funds and ensure the stability of the financial system. He commended the EFCC for its relentless efforts in the fight against corruption and financial crimes emphasising the indispensable role it plays as a key member of the Taskforce on Implementation of the Failed Banks Act which is chaired by the NDIC. Mr. Hassan elaborated on the existing partnership between the two organisations which led to the establishment of the NDIC Help Desk in the EFCC in August 2022. As a result, he added, a total number of 10 high profile cases referred to the Commission are currently under investigation.

The NDIC boss called for enhanced collaboration in the recovery of depositors' funds to ensure that liquidation dividends are paid to depositors whose monies were lost as a result of bank failures. He therefore, solicited for the return of recoveries made by the EFCC on behalf of the NDIC to the Corporation's coffers in order to facilitate the timely reimbursement of depositors. The EFCC Chairman Mr. Ola Olukoyede emphasised the interconnection between criminal activities and bank failures, urging NDIC and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to intensify oversight to prevent the risk of bank failure.

To make sure you stay nicely groomed all the time, this article will help you learn how to maintain and clean beard trimmers.

How to Clean Beard Trimmers?The first thing to remember is that you must clean a trimmer after each use.

To clean the trimmer in the best way possible, make sure you rinse it in water. However, some battery-operated trimmers are not to be rinsed, so make sure you read the manual before rinsing.

After rinsing and allowing the trimmer to dry, use a precise brush to remove all the leftover hair on the trimmer.

After removing the hair and brushing the trimmer completely, pour in some oil on the blades and turn on the trimmer for a few seconds so that there is enough lubrication.

After cleaning the trimmer, keep it in a cool and dry place. Avoid keeping them away from direct sunlight.

""Unfortunately, the expected speed of the expansion of renewable energies does not yet match reality,"" said Michael Kohn, Head of Global Project Finance at Baywa r.e..

""Solar plants often take up to five years from planning to construction. Wind farms are more complex in terms of approval. It can take even longer."" However, the manager emphasized that this also applies to other countries: ""Not only in Germany, but in many markets."" The Munich-based company plans and builds wind and solar parks internationally with 5400 employees worldwide.

The German government aims to cover 80 percent of German electricity consumption from renewable energies by 2030. There is a consensus in the industry that expansion needs to progress faster to achieve this target - and that bureaucracy is one of the obstacles.

The German Association of Energy and Water Industries, the Association of Municipal Enterprises and management consultants Deloitte estimated in the fall that annual investment in the energy transition would have to increase almost fivefold by 2030 compared to 2022: from 22 billion to 100 billion euros.

Apart from the capital requirements, this would also mean more work for the authorities. However, according to Baywa r.e., they are already at the limits of their capacity at the current pace: ""This cannot be accelerated immediately and aligned with the expansion requirements, partly due to a lack of staff in the offices that process the permits,"" said Kohn.

In Germany, objections and lawsuits also make the procedures more difficult and unpredictable in terms of time and content. Appeals and lawsuits are very important, but ""in our opinion, they should be limited to the important areas worthy of protection,"" said Kohn. ""We see complaints from residents who have legitimate concerns, for example about the noise and shadows cast by a wind turbine."" These concerns are best addressed beforehand in dialog or as part of the approval process. ""However, it is often the case that people sue for the sake of it, even if there is no prospect of success. A lawsuit usually means a delay of up to several years.""

The next major obstacle in many markets is the grid connection. ""There is often a bottleneck in the availability of grid connection capacities. In some cases, connection points are allocated that are far too far away from the actual project.""

Easier financing

According to Kohn, however, financing new green energy plants in Germany is generally less complex than abroad: ""Instead of requiring extensive external advice - including legal, tax, technical and insurance advice - as is quite common in the international environment, the project assessment in Germany is generally carried out within the bank without the help of external consultants,"" said the financing expert. ""This means that very time-critical and often complex work packages are shortened.""

Baywa r.e. emerged from the green electricity business of the Baywa Group, which was originally active in agricultural trade, and generated sales of almost 6.5 billion euros in 2022. The parent company will publish the figures for 2023 at the end of the week. ""At the moment, we as an industry are dealing with very tense market parameters, still high inflation rates, high interest rates, high investment costs and one or two uncertainties in the supply chains,"" said Kohn. However, banks and other investors are still keen to invest. ""Overall, the industry in Germany is continuing to grow and we are very confident about the future thanks to our well-filled project pipeline.""/cho/DP/zb",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1764705882352942,448965438,1,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Did you know that in the 1990s, Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions, a Japanese company, introduced an innovative ATM machine equipped with a unique feature? This groundbreaking technology aimed not only to dispense cash but also to ensure hygiene by tackling the issue of bacterial contamination on banknotes.

Unlike conventional ATMs, which simply dispense bills, this revolutionary machine incorporated a novel approach to cleanliness. It employed a method of heating the banknotes to a high temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. This elevated heat was specifically chosen to effectively eliminate bacteria present on the bills. By subjecting the currency to such extreme heat, the ATM effectively sterilised the banknotes, addressing concerns regarding the transmission of germs through cash transactions.

But the ingenuity didn't stop there. After the bills were thoroughly heated and sanitised, the ATM proceeded to iron them before dispensing them. This additional step not only ensured the removal of any remaining bacteria but also imparted a crispness to the bills, giving customers a fresh and clean experience when handling their cash withdrawals.

This innovation from Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions represented a significant advancement in ATM technology, reflecting a proactive approach to addressing public health concerns associated with everyday financial transactions. By incorporating features designed to enhance hygiene, the company demonstrated its commitment to providing safe and sanitary solutions for its customers.

While the concept of heating and ironing banknotes may seem unconventional, it underscores the importance of maintaining cleanliness in public spaces, especially in high-traffic areas like banks and ATMs. By implementing this innovative technology, Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions set a new standard for ATM functionality, prioritising both convenience and hygiene in financial transactions.

In summary, the introduction of the ATM with built-in sterilisation and ironing capabilities by Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions in the 1990s represented a significant milestone in banking technology. This innovative approach not only provided customers with access to cash but also ensured the cleanliness and hygiene of the banknotes, demonstrating a commitment to public health and safety.",gadgets360.com,news,NDTV Gadgets 360,,0.4352941176470588,448965413,1,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-03/um03a6m8_atm-unsplash_625x300_23_March_24.jpg,

The Minister, said sectorial linkage has been identified as missing in creating a holistic approach to drive industrialization in the country.

She highlighted this at the weekend during her official visit to one of the country's largest indigenous steel manufacturing Company, KAM STEEL INTEGRATED COMPANY LIMITED, Located at Holiness Highway, Igbafa Village, Sagamu, Ogun State.

Kam Steel Integrated Company Limited is a wholly owned indigenous integrated steel company in Nigeria having capabilities in contributing to the sector and economy of the country.

The visit of the Minister is in line with the agenda of Mr. President His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu(GCFR), to reposition the economic growth through industrialization that will help in job creation, infrastructures, stable power etc.

During the visit, Minister expressed her satisfaction with the state of the art infrastructure at KAMSTEEL and commended Ultra Modern Production capabilities of the Company.

She equally noted the desire of the Federal Government to revamp the nation's steel sector to enhance the economy as well as create employment opportunities.

The Minister stated that the country's abundant mineral resources hold the key to reshaping the nation's economic landscape and extending the benefits of democracy to every Nigerian.

By tapping into the latent potential of the steel sector and channeling it into lucrative ventures, we can ensure that the dividends of democracy reach every citizen.

""The steel sector stands as a pivotal pillar of Nigeria's industrial growth, carrying the potential to provide substantial job opportunities for the youth.

""To realise this vision, the government is fully dedicated to implementing an extensive array of measures designed to attract reputable international investors,"" she said.

Dr. Doris, reiterated her determination to boost Nigeria's economy through aggressive industrialisation and robust investment regime.

""It's time to set Nigeria on the path of greatness through industrialisation and investment,"" Dr. Uzoka-Anite said.

The Minister further promised to consolidate on the mandate of President Tinubu in improving the economy by creating more investment and jobs for Nigerians.

She also harped on the readiness to rebrand Nigeria to the outside world to pull and attract more foreign direct investment and also make the country an investment hub for prospective investors, fostering the ease of doing business across the country.

In his remarks, Group Managing Director/CEO of KAM HOLDING, Dr. Yusuf Kamoru (MON), thanked the Minister for the visit and assured that the company is striving to sustain operations despite the economic headwinds and other critical challenges being faced by the sector.

If the thousands of proposed solar, wind and battery energy projects got built, they would more than double the amount of electricity that is currently produced nationwide and get the U.S. much closer to its clean energy targets.

But there's one big problem: America's power lines can't carry that much juice.

The country's limited transmission infrastructure is causing a huge backlog: Wait times for regulators to approve grid connections now last about five years on average, a figure that stood at less than two years in 2008.

""We have a ton of resources sitting in [backlogs] that can't get connected to the system,"" said Byron Corum, technical adviser to Commissioner Allison Clements, who serves on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ""One of the big reasons is we're running out of space on the transmission grid.""

Building new transmission lines to swoop across the nation's landscape can cost billions of dollars and require decades of permitting and construction. As that work continues, some policymakers are pushing an interim solution: squeezing more capacity out of existing power lines.

Grid-enhancing technologies, or GETs, are low-cost, quick-to-deploy devices that can help existing infrastructure carry up to 40% more electricity. Backers say these upgrades could bring a surge of clean energy projects online, even as future transmission lines remain under construction.

Congestion on the grid cost consumers more than $20 billion in 2022, one analysis found, a massive spike from just a few years before. Some lawmakers think technology upgrades could significantly lower utility bills in addition to their climate benefits.

""They are very cheap in terms of how much money they save for the grid when compared to creating new lines, which can be billions of dollars,"" said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

But many utilities have been slow to deploy GETs. In most states, utilities can charge higher rates based on investments they've made to improve infrastructure. That means expensive projects -- such as building new power lines -- deliver a much higher profit return than low-cost upgrades.

""Utilities are definitely biased toward building big, expensive projects where they get a solid return and make a bunch of money,"" said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. ""That's not what GETs is.""

In eight states, legislators have put forward bills that would force utilities to evaluate grid-enhancing technologies in the planning documents they are required to submit to state regulators. Backers believe those reports will demonstrate that GETs can meet capacity needs at the lowest cost to ratepayers, which would force utilities to adopt them under their regulatory mandates.

Some proponents believe further changes to utilities' incentive structure may be needed to ensure widespread use.

While GETs-related bills have not drawn specific pushback along partisan lines or from industry groups, backers acknowledge that challenges remain.

Grid-enhancing technologies come in several forms. One technology uses real-time temperature and wind measurements to determine how much power can pass through lines without overheating, enabling more electricity to flow when it's safe. Such ""dynamic line ratings"" would replace static systems that limit electricity flow based on conservative estimates of potential high temperatures.

New system controls can redirect power from congested lines to corridors that are less crowded. And software technology can evenly distribute electricity over a transmission network, preventing overloads and increasing capacity.

Taken together, these tools can dramatically increase the carrying capacity of existing power lines under certain conditions. They also can make the grid more resilient and less vulnerable to overloads and outages.

""It allows [renewable electricity] to get to the market more efficiently, and that helps with more affordability,"" said Sandra Jenkins, director of grid controls with the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity.

The department has spent more than $8 million on grid-enhancing research and demonstration projects across four regions.

Jenkins said one ongoing challenge is that grid operators will need to adopt a standardized system of collecting data, since the analytics-heavy technology could create accessibility headaches without a single set of guidelines.

Several state lawmakers said they were encouraged by a report published earlier this year by the climate-focused nonprofit RMI. Looking at a grid sector covering parts of the eastern United States, the authors found that GETs could allow an additional 6.6 gigawatts of clean energy to come online by 2027. That added capacity could power about 5 million homes while yielding $1 billion each year in production cost savings, with an installation cost of $100 million.

""GETs are incredibly fast and cost-effective,"" said Katie Siegner, a manager focused on grid policy within RMI's Carbon-Free Electricity practice. ""They can be deployed in months, compared to the decades it might take to site a new transmission line.""

Last year, Colorado became the first state to enact a law advancing grid-enhancing technologies. The measure, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Chris Hansen, requires utilities to study the potential of GETs before breaking ground on a new transmission line. Forcing utilities to consider those upgrades, Hansen said, should allow the state's fast-growing renewable energy sector to bring more power online.

""We've got to play catch-up,"" he said. ""We've got to make the investments now to get the system where it needs to be in the next decade.""

In Virginia, state lawmakers passed a bill late last month requiring utilities to study grid-enhancing technologies in their planning documents. The measure is awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

""We're making them take a close look and see if it makes sense,"" said state Del. Phil Hernandez, the bill's Democratic sponsor. ""Knowing the promise they hold, we hope we'll be able to nudge them in that direction.""

Hernandez said the bill did not face pushback from the state's utilities. While some lawmakers voted against the bill, they did not explain their objections during a Senate hearing on the proposal. Republican state Sen. Mark Obenshain, who also serves on the General Assembly's Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, did not respond to an inquiry about voting against the bill in committee or on its final passage.

Minnesota lawmakers are considering a similar bill this session. The measure, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Larry Kraft, would direct utilities to evaluate congestion on their networks by 2025 and determine how GETs could be used to address it. Like many of the states pursuing GETs legislation, Minnesota has a law requiring a shift to clean electricity in the coming years. Coupled with a growing demand for electric cars and heating systems, legislators expect the state's transmission needs to increase.

""This makes so much sense,"" Kraft said. ""We are expecting a lot more renewables on the grid, and GETs could be really helpful in certain cases.""

Kraft said the measure will likely be included in an omnibus bill at the end of the legislative session.

In a letter to Minnesota lawmakers, the regional utility Xcel Energy expressed its support for GETs and credited the bill with ""jump-starting"" a conversation. However, the utility noted that its infrastructure in Minnesota connects to a multistate grid. The full benefits of GETs, Xcel wrote, depend on a collaborative multistate process rather than a utility-by-utility plan. The letter noted other examples in which the larger regional transmission organization that Xcel is part of would need to be considered in plans to use such upgrades.

In Utah, Blouin's bill passed the Senate without objection, but did not get a vote on the House floor before the end of the legislative session. An earlier version of the measure would have allowed utilities to retain a portion of the savings generated by the deployment of GETs. Blouin and some advocates said that might incentivize utilities to pursue such upgrades, even as the new transmission lines that deliver larger profits remain under development.

The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners did not respond to an interview request. Neither Dominion Energy, which supplies electricity in Virginia and other states, nor the Edison Electric Institute, an association the represents electric companies, responded to interview requests by publication time.

Lawmakers in other states -- including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and South Carolina -- have proposed similar bills, mostly focused on requiring their utilities to study GETs and provide reports on how they could benefit their systems.

Though many of the measures have drawn bipartisan support, all but South Carolina's are sponsored by Democrats.

Shannon Grove's recent discussion on the escalating energy costs in California resonates deeply, especially for us in Kern County. Our region's substantial role in fueling the state's diverse energy mix is met with an unjust economic challenge: skyrocketing utility bills that eclipse both income growth and the cost of living. This situation underscores a glaring contradiction: our leadership in energy production contrasts sharply with the financial strain we endure.

The shift toward cleaner energy sources is indeed a noble goal. However, this transition necessitates policies that acknowledge and respect the economic variances across California's communities. It is unfair for the residents of Kern County, who play a crucial role in the state's energy sector, to face punitive costs. Our dedication to advancing energy solutions warrants fair policies that mitigate the economic burdens on those leading California's energy advancements.

This has been achieved by using 'double composite' structures which use less concrete and steel.

The news comes as engineers at Westbury, on the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire border, were installing the second viaduct deck.

This design change followed the early success of HS2's first double composite viaduct at Wendover Dean.

The new method draws on experiences from high-speed rail projects across Europe.

Unlike traditional single composite structures, where steel beams support a reinforced concrete deck, the double composite design adds a concrete bottom, drastically reducing the overall amount of concrete and steel used.

The production of steel and concrete is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in construction.

This move allowed the team to reduce the embedded carbon in the five viaducts - Westbury, Turweston, Wendover, Small Dean and Lower Thorpe - by between 52 and 66 per cent.

Westbury Viaduct (Image: HS2)

HS2's head of civil structures, Tomas Garcia, said: ""HS2 will improve journeys between Britain's two biggest cities while freeing up more space on the most overcrowded parts of the existing mainline for more local services.

""The double composite approach - which combines the strength of steel in tension and with concrete in compression - has huge potential to cut carbon in construction by enabling more efficient bridges.

""I look forward to seeing them completed and hope the lessons we have learnt can be successfully applied to other bridge projects across the UK.""

One of the viaducts at Brackley is currently having its 320-metre-long double composite deck positioned.

The viaduct is part of HS2's project to better connect London, Birmingham and the North, with the potential to provide more train services on the busy southern end of the West Coast Main Line into London Euston.

Changes in the bridge's craftsmanship, including the use of low-carbon concrete and steel along with alternative foundations, helped the design panel cut the viaduct's embedded carbon by 60 per cent.

EKFB, made up of Eiffage, Kier, Ferrovial Construction and BAM Nuttall, is delivering civil engineering work on 80km of HS2.

Jose Candel, EKFB's design delivery director, said: ""The double composite design of this group of viaducts spanning Bucks and Northants is exemplary here in the UK.

""This industry-leading approach is innovating and paving the way for future infrastructure projects which will not only benefit on-site construction but supports EKFB's drive to reduce a huge amount of carbon in the process.""

There are various causes for infectious diseases. These include fungi, parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Several diseases have animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission.

Vector-borne diseases are a specific type of infectious disease. They are caused by pathogens that vectors, such as ticks and mosquitoes, carry. Some vector-caused diseases are Zika, malaria, and dengue.

The alerting patterns of rain are expanding these vectors' range and active periods. Longer summers and warmer and shorter winters have also been associated with more vector-borne conditions. For instance, conditions caused by ticks, such as Lyme disease and babesiosis, also occur in the winter.

Matthew Phillips, the study's first author and an infectious disease fellow from Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, explains that tick-borne disease cases have been seen in January and February. The tick season begins earlier and has more activity and a wider range of ticks.

Malaria is another concern. Malaria-transmitting mosquitoes are stretching northward, a change induced by climate change. Rain pattern alterations have resulted in more mosquitoes and a higher disease transmission rate.

Zoonotic diseases have also changed in location and incidence. According to experts, animal natural ranges and migration patterns have also changed.

Because of their loss of habitat, wild animals have been nearing humans. This leads to a higher risk of animal diseases spreading to humans and novel pathogens eventually developing.

The study also noted the emergence of novel fungal infections and changes in some fungal pathogen locations. For example, the Coccidioides fungal infection used to be endemic to dry and hot areas across Arizona and California. However, valley fever has been picked up recently in Washington State.

Not to mention, in the past few years, infectious diseases, including COVID-19, have gravely affected the world.

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, one concept stands out as a beacon of promise: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, the need for transparency and understanding in AI decision-making processes becomes paramount. XAI holds the key to unlocking insights and ensuring that AI systems are not only accurate but also comprehensible to humans. In this article, we will delve into the significance of XAI in the tech industry, exploring its benefits, challenges, and potential applications.

Understanding XAI: Bridging the Gap Between Humans and Machines

At its core, XAI seeks to bridge the gap between the complex algorithms powering AI systems and human comprehension. Traditional AI models, such as deep learning neural networks, often operate as ""black boxes,"" making it difficult for users to understand how decisions are reached. This lack of transparency can lead to distrust and hinder the widespread adoption of AI technologies. XAI aims to address this challenge by providing explanations for AI-driven decisions in a clear and understandable manner.

The Importance of Transparency in AI

Transparency is crucial not only for building trust but also for ensuring accountability and fairness in AI systems. In domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where AI algorithms are increasingly being utilized to make critical decisions, the ability to understand and scrutinize these decisions is paramount. XAI empowers users to interrogate AI models, uncover biases, and mitigate potential risks, ultimately enhancing the reliability and fairness of AI-driven processes.

Benefits of XAI in the Tech Industry

The integration of XAI into the tech industry offers a myriad of benefits. By providing explanations for AI decisions, XAI enables users to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of AI models. This enhanced transparency fosters trust and confidence in AI technologies, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various sectors. Moreover, XAI can facilitate collaboration between humans and machines, leveraging the strengths of both to achieve optimal outcomes.

Challenges and Considerations

Despite its promise, XAI is not without its challenges. One major hurdle is the trade-off between transparency and performance. As AI models become increasingly complex and sophisticated, providing explanations without compromising accuracy and efficiency poses a significant challenge. Moreover, ensuring that explanations are meaningful and comprehensible to users from diverse backgrounds remains a daunting task. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, ethicists, psychologists, and domain experts to develop robust and user-friendly XAI solutions.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) holds immense promise in revolutionizing the tech industry. By providing transparent and interpretable AI solutions, XAI empowers users to understand, trust, and collaborate with AI systems effectively. However, realizing the full potential of XAI requires concerted efforts from researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders to overcome technical, ethical, and societal challenges. By embracing XAI, we can unlock new insights, drive innovation, and shape a future where AI technologies serve the common good while respecting human values and dignity.

The promoters of this initiative, led by the group Mighty Earth, demand a plan to reduce these emissions, arguing that in these sectors hardly any efforts have been made to combat warming.

This proposal has been formulated in the allegations presented to the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, where the Administration sets out its objectives for the decarbonization of the economy.

Mighty Earth, an international organization recently established in Spain, proposes that the Government set itself the goal of reducing methane emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 2020.

The request is directed especially at the agricultural and livestock sector as they generate large quantities of methane, which is the second greenhouse gas in volume after carbon dioxide (CO2), and with a warming potential 86 times greater than this. in a 20 year cycle.

The agricultural and livestock sector is responsible for 11.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Spain (2021 data) and is responsible for 62.7% of the methane thrown into the atmosphere.

And, within this area, the main focuses are the enteric fermentation of herbivores (belches and wind of cattle, especially), as well as pig or chicken farms and manure management. The other big focus is landfills.

The promoters of this initiative recall that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been insisting on the need to reduce emissions of methane and other gases if the temperature increase is to be contained below 1.5ºC.

And Spain signed the Global Commitment on Methane at the Glasgow climate summit (2021), although countries have shifted action towards methane reductions in the hydrocarbon extraction and transportation sector (leak control and so on). .

""It is very good to act in the field of hydrocarbons, but it is also key to do so in the field of agriculture, livestock and waste,"" says Carlos Bravo, representative of Mighty Earth in Spain and expert in public policies.

In their proposal to reduce methane emissions, these entities propose a progressive reduction in meat production levels, the promotion of healthy diets (vegetarian or with lower meat or dairy content) and the promotion of vegetable proteins.

""The Spanish Food Safety Agency recommends moderate consumption of meat since its continued and/or excessive consumption is related to health problems,"" says Carlos Bravo, representatives of Mighty Earth in Spain.

""Several studies have shown that methane reduction could be more easily achieved if EU citizens changed their diet to one with less meat and dairy consumption following national guidelines, which would lead to a reduction in the volume of livestock in the U. "", adds Carlos Bravo. These policies could mean a reduction of between 29% and 37% of the sector's methane emissions, according to the aforementioned allegations presented.

In December of last year, the European Commission made an evaluation of the updated draft of the National Energy and Climate Plan (Pniec) of Spain, and underlined precisely the shortcomings that Mighty Earth now reveals.

The Commission already warned then that the Pniec ""does not provide information on the implementation schedule, nor on the sources of financing"" related to measures to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector.

In addition, it was pointed out that the plan ""does not pay attention to methane emissions from enteric fermentation"" in the agriculture and livestock sector, despite ""which constitutes the largest source of emissions other than CO2,"" he points out, pointing out to methane from cattle and sheep.

The ""insufficient effort"" of these sectors is also considered worrying, according to the content of the Spanish long-term strategy aimed at achieving climate neutrality in 2050.

The scenarios drawn for the middle of the century foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions not from energy use for the primary sector, specifically 53% compared to the reference years (1990).

However, more of the emissions that would remain in 2050 will come from the agricultural and livestock sector, which for Bravo demonstrates the low ambition of this strategy.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.07450980392156858,448964564,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_78a19.png,eng-9414921

The consequences of this include rising temperatures, shifts in precipitation patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts. Elevated temperatures can accelerate microbial activity in soil, potentially resulting in an increased rate of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. This increased microbial decomposition may, in turn, lead to a release of CO², contributing to a positive feedback loop amplifying climate warming. To understand the microbial feedback to warming, I studied the processes leading to carbon (C) accumulation through microbial growth and CO² release via microbial respiration. I determined the temperature dependence of microbial growth and respiration to assess how these process rates change with altered temperatures. The results of this thesis indicate that (i) the microbial temperature dependence is not dependent on soil moisture. This validation through an empirical test is important, as most ecosystem models employ a distinct temperature dependence that operates independently of soil moisture. In addition, (ii) the temperature dependence of bacterial growth can become warm-shifted within one growing season due to a summer heat wave simulation in the field and with a similar trend for fungal growth. The warm-shifted bacterial growth temperature dependence fully recovered within a year and matched the temperature dependence at ambient conditions. These findings highlight the fast microbial responses to a heat wave and the long-lasting legacy of such extreme weather events. The results also indicate that (iii) the microbial temperature dependence varies systematically with environmental temperatures along a wide climate gradient in Europe. Microbial communities showed warm-shifted temperature dependences in warmer ecosystems and cold-shifted temperature dependences in colder areas. Finally, (iv) empirically determined microbial temperature dependences were incorporated into a dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Specifically, separate temperature dependence for microbial growth and respiration were employed to represent C sequestration and emissions from soils in response to temperature variations. In addition, the microbial temperature dependences were allowed to adjust to the climate that they encounter. Therefore, the microbial thermal traits can become climate-specific and adjust to changes in thermal regimes.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.3725490196078431,448964505,1,,

That's by design.

A statewide lottery is banned in Nevada's 159-year-old constitution. The constitution was written when lotteries were seen as corrupt and coincided with a series of national reforms, most famously abolition, that swept the United States in the 1800s.

""By the early 19th century, most lotteries were crooked. These lotteries were either not giving the prize, or being fixed,"" Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who specializes in Nevada and Las Vegas history, told the Washington Examiner.

The casino industry has made sure statewide lotteries have remained banned, and neighboring states such as California and Arizona are reaping the benefits while locals miss out. However, a change to the ban may be within reach.

In 2023, Assemblyman Cameron ""C.H."" Miller introduced an amendment to enact a statewide lottery, with revenue from the lottery allocated to mental health funding.

""This constitutional amendment authorizing a lottery and dedicating the revenue to funding for youth mental health is a common sense solution that will help the many Nevada youth who are battling mental health challenges, just like I did as a child,"" Miller said.

""Right now, we are sending millions of dollars across the border to neighboring states. It is time to fully invest in Nevadans and pass this constitutional amendment,"" he said. Mississippi, the most recent state to enact a statewide lottery, has seen $488 million generated since 2019, all dedicated to the state's Department of Transportation and Department of Education.

The road to the amendment may be bumpy, though. Since 1975, there have been 30 failed attempts at amending the state's constitution to enact the lottery. The casino industry, one of the state's most powerful entities, has long posed a barrier to the change.

The casino industry says ""there's not really a lot of creation of jobs and economic development"" in statewide lotteries, Mark Nichols, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies the gaming industry, told the Washington Examiner. The casino industry is the largest employer in Las Vegas, the state's population center.

""That would take away from the gaming industry's ability to do what it does best, which is to create new jobs and generate new revenue for the states, so it would come at the expense of something else,"" Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resorts Association, said on the topic of a statewide lottery in 2016.

Nichols said that argument only works to a certain extent, as many games within casinos and in places such as grocery stores, bars, and airports across Nevada also don't require someone to man them.

""Grocery stores, convenience stores, pretty much most bars have slot machines in them as well,"" Nichols said. ""But those don't create a lot of jobs, don't create a lot of economic development. People don't travel across the country to do that and say, 'Hey, let's go to that 7/11 and play.'""

""Everyone's operating already in states where there are lotteries. They're doing fine. They're doing well,"" Miller said. ""The operation of a lottery could compete with their business, and it's my position that it shouldn't be a competition. We can be partners together.""

Still, based on other states with both legalized gambling and lotteries, there seems to be little competition between the two, such as in Massachusetts.

""In Massachusetts, we actually had lottery data at the outlet level, so we knew what every single store in Massachusetts sold as far as lottery tickets,"" Nichols said. ""We looked at what happened to lottery sales after casinos in Massachusetts opened, and really we did not see any kind of decrease in lottery sales whatsoever.""

He said they examined individual store data near casinos and found that industries had no effect on each other's sales.

Nicols said the lottery entices people because casinos don't offer games with such high winnings for such a low dollar amount bet. Nichols also said Nevadans are aware of the ins and outs of gaming like scratch cards, which are also small-dollar buy-ins, but low earnings as compared to the lottery.

""Most people that gamble, particularly that gamble regularly and live in Nevada, they know that they're probably not going to be too enticed to play scratch cards,"" Nichols said.

A lottery would then be mostly bought by residents, not people traveling to Nevada to gamble because they can likely buy a lottery ticket in their home state.

""Tourists might make it part of their experience. I'm not sold on its importance to tourism, since it's available elsewhere,"" Green said.

Without having a statewide lottery, Nevada is losing out on millions of dollars of sales to neighboring states.

A 2016 report showed a lotto store in the California-Nevada border town of Primm, 30 minutes south of Las Vegas with a population of 1,000, sold $13 million worth of lottery tickets in a single year. That road that divides the two states is called ""Lotto Store Road.""

""There's a store that's right here on the border; it's 10 miles from where I'm sitting, and that's, I think, one of California's best outlets for lottery sales,"" Nichols said. ""The border literally goes right down the middle of the store. So, on one side, you can buy lottery tickets, and on one side, you can use slot machines.""

It'll be a long and uphill battle for Miller's amendment legalizing a statewide lottery. The legislature would have to vote again on the bill in 2025. Then the law would be put on a ballot for a statewide vote. The earliest estimate places the vote on a 2027 ballot.",washingtonexaminer.com,news,Washington Examiner,Annabella Rosciglione,-0.1058823529411764,448964432,1,https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/powerball.jpg,

Red and black stand out on the gray Sunday morning in Freiburg. Dressed in Bayer Leverkusen t-shirts and scarves, dozens of fans walk before the game in the drizzle through the old town next to the cathedral and its particular bächle, streams that run along the side of the streets of the German city. One more movement, they accompany en masse - about 3,800 - the outsider club of European football, the fashionable team that overwhelms Germany and excites fans like never before in its 120 years of history.

The derisive nickname of Neverkusen seems to have an expiration date. If until now the 1988 UEFA victory against Espanyol and a German Cup were the only trophies that were displayed in their showcases - in addition to countless runners-up finishes - everything indicates that when the current season ends in the city of North Rhine-Westphalia there will be make room, at least, for one more title. And it will be thanks, in large part, to Xabi Alonso. ""We would never have imagined something like this when he arrived. ""We were second to last!"" Rudi, a fan staying a few meters from the Leverkusen concentration hotel, is still surprised. 17 months in the elite have been enough for the Tolosarra to earn respect as a coach. In fact, the aspirin team - founded by workers from the pharmaceutical company Bayer - was in seventeenth position when in October 2022 it received a call from Barcelona-born Fernando Carro, general director of the entity for six years. A bet that could be considered risky due to the delicate situation of the club and Alonso's short experience on the bench (Real Madrid youth team and Real Sociedad reserve team). ""It was an option for the future that we were already considering. He convinced us with his experience as a player, his leadership capacity and his clairvoyance about the football he wants. There was chemistry from the first meeting,"" Carro, architect of the project along with Simon Rolfes, former club player and sports director, explains to La Vanguardia. Alonso took with him only his right-hand man, Sebas Parrilla. The rest of the coaching staff - among which are the Spaniards Alberto Encinas and Ismael Camenforte, with a past at La Masia - were already at the entity. ""We like the coaches to integrate into the club and that means assuming part of the professional structure that already exists,"" argues Carro. Alonso's arrival took effect immediately. The team finished sixth and was on the verge of the Europa League final. But the best was yet to come.

It has been months since the leadership of the Bundesliga that it has held since the first days ceased to be a surprise. According to Carro, his impact ""has to do with the impact of a figure of his level and undoubtedly with the sporting results, which make him even greater and international."" Leverkusen is a solid team with its own identity, the only unbeaten team in Europe in all competitions. With eight days left, he takes ten points off Bayern, champion of the last eleven leagues. The Bavarians, irregular, try to put pressure, so far without success. Freiburg was a dangerous place for Die Werkself (the company's eleven). At the Europa-Park stadium Bayern had dropped a couple of points at the beginning of the month. Freiburg (9th) is not a lesser team, leaving three days before the Europa League, a competition in which Leverkusen miraculously continues. That same Thursday they turned the score around against Qarabag with two goals from Schick in added time (3-2) to get into the quarterfinals.

The physical and emotional exhaustion of the magical night at the BayArena did not weigh too much. The Czech returned to victory with the third goal in Freiburg (2-3). Before, youngsters Wirtz (20) and Hložek (21) scored; the first after pulling a beautiful thread out of his hat in the minute and a half of play, while the second took advantage of an indecision by the rival goalkeeper forced by the leaked ball from Wirtz - the jewel of this team - to Álex Grimaldo. The left-footed winger with the soul of a playmaker is another of the club's great joys. The Blaugrana youth squad arrived for free last summer from Benfica. Since January there has also been another Spaniard: Borja Iglesias. One more day, Alonso's team extended the record of matches without losing in Germany (26). The balance in all competitions is 33 wins and 5 draws. Goal scoring, widely distributed, is another of the team's great virtues, with an average of 2.9 goals per game - three goals or more in 22 of the 38 games. Many of those victories were achieved in the final stretch, with 20 goals from the 80th minute onwards, translating into many points. ""The transformation process of this team has been incredible. In addition to an attractive game, Xabi Alonso has been able to implement the winning mentality that defined him as a footballer,"" says Phillip Arens, a Bild journalist who has been covering the club's news for more than 15 years. And he presents a revealing fact to illustrate the change of chip: ""Before his arrival the team had missed seven of the last eight penalties. With him they have transformed all the launches.""

April will be a decisive month. The effort of being alive in three competitions - they are also in the semi-finals of the German Cup, with rivals from lower divisions - is compensated by the excitement of the moment. Enjoying the journey will pay off. Barring a catastrophe, 31 years of drought will end. What will happen after lifting a trophy? Greats like Liverpool or Bayern, his former teams, have a vacancy on the bench. The noise is inevitable. ""He is one of the best coaches. It is a great satisfaction to have him and I think the feeling is mutual, because he also values the project and club he is in,"" says Carro.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.1843137254901961,448964283,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_ab04d.png,

But as we learn more about the important pollinators, insect-eating toads, songbirds and beneficial insects, the more we realize we need to adjust some of our timing and methods.

It is safe to remove winter protection, such as mulch, when temperatures begin to hover around freezing or your plants begin to sprout. Keep some frost protection handy just in case you need to protect any tender plants from a hard freeze.

Always check for frost heaving. When cold winters are interrupted by warm spells, bare soil may thaw and then refreeze. This temperature fluctuation can cause the soil to shift and push spring flowering bulbs, coral bells, daylilies and other perennials out of the soil. Just gently push them back in place or reset in the soil, making sure the roots are covered.

Wait for temperatures to be consistently above 50 degrees before cutting back perennials that were left standing. This gives any beneficial insects overwintering in the hollow stems time to emerge and find a summer home.

Cut some of the stems to the ground and some back to 18 to 24 inches on each plant. These old stems provide summer homes for some of our native bees. As new growth emerges in spring, it will mask the older stems so your garden will look as beautiful as ever.

If you can't wait, stack the stems out of sight until temperatures rise and pollinators have a chance to emerge. Then chop and compost the debris in midsummer.

Tie or bungy-cord tall ornamental grass plants before cutting them back to make cleanup easier. Then use a hand pruner for small jobs or a string trimmer or hedge clipper for larger plantings. Wait for new growth to fill in shorter grasses and simply comb your fingers through the plant to remove the old brown leaves.

Leave fall leaves on the soil surrounding the plants to serve as mulch, suppressing weeds and conserving moisture. As the leaves break down, they add organic matter and nutrients to the soil. They also provide homes for beneficial insects and insulate the soil for plants, toads and more.

Mark the location of perennials like butterfly weed and hardy hibiscus that emerge later than most plants in spring. This helps to avoid accidentally weeding them out. Leave a few stems standing, use plant markers or, next fall, plant some spring flowering bulbs near the plants to serve as a colorful placeholder.

Consider leaving some sunny spots bare for ground-nesting bees. Avoid areas like entryways and gathering spots where people and the bees may collide. Although the bees are docile and not likely to sting, people are often fearful, leading to their elimination. Setting aside some out-of-the-way spaces for ground-nesting bees allows everyone to coexist more happily.

This is also a good time to tidy up garden beds and lawn edges. You'll slow the invasion of weeds and grass into garden beds and lawn encroaching onto walks.

Remove weeds as they appear. The smaller weeds are easier to remove and eliminating them before they flower and set seed means fewer weeds to pull in the future.

Take advantage of the delay in spring cleaning by cleaning and sharpening your tools. When the temperatures are right, with tools in hand, you'll be ready to get busy in the garden.",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,0.2156862745098038,448964197,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/24/id5613860-ATHOME-GARDEN-POLLINATORS-DMT-1080x720.jpeg,eng-9420655

Here's what he said!

If there's one dialogue one could dedicate to Shah Rukh Khan, it'll be ""ek hi toh dil hai, kitni baar jeetoge!"" Whether it is his wit or acting skills, SRK has a special place in our hearts. That includes Navot Singh Sidhu, who received all praise for the Jawan actor at the recent IPL 2024 match. Scroll below for the exciting details!

After a smashing start between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), we saw Punjab Kings (PBKS) score a victory against Delhi Capitals (DC) on Saturday. IPL 2024's third match was between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Shah Rukh Khan appeared to boost the morale of his team's players.

And as the superstar walked through the ground, greeting the crown, Navjot Singh Sidhu praised him from the commentary box. As the camera panned towards the Pathaan star, the host said, ""Shah Rukh Khan saab, ijjat, maan aur samaan ke patra hai! (He deserves name, fame, and respect).""

Navjot Singh Sidhu continued, ""Maine Abhishek Bachchan saab ko ek baar suna tha ki industry me aisa koi aadmi hai jo asurakshit nahi hai, wo Shah Rukh Khan hai. (Abhishek Bachchan once said if there's anyone who is not insecure in Bollywood, that's SRK).""

During the early days of his career, Shah Rukh Khan worked in Television shows like Circus and Fauji. Navjot Singh once met the then-budding actor at the Model School ground. SRK expressed his wish to be an actor, but when Sidhu asked him about the fierce competition in Bollywood, the superstar responded, ""I don't compete with anyone; I compete with myself.""

Navjot Singh Sidhu concluded his kind words for Shah Rukh by adding, ""He is as humble as he is successful.""

Shah Rukh Khan went through a tough phase in his career after facing back-to-back flops in Bollywood. He decided to take a hiatus after the Zero debacle in 2018. Many thought his reign was over, but he bounced back stronger than ever.

SRK created a storm at the box office with his comeback film Pathaan. Directed by Siddharth Anand, the action flick also starred Deepika Padukone and John Abraham in lead roles.

Pathaan grossed 543.22 crores at the Indian box office and was declared a hit! The streak of success followed with Jawan and Dunki in 2023. He will be next seen in Pathaan 2, followed by Tiger vs Pathaan, which will feature him alongside best friend Salman Khan.

Investigation shows environmental gaps from Quebec to the Amazon,"At times, Rio Tinto has spilled dangerous chemicals at several of its Quebec sites without disclosing it to the provincial government -- behaviour that contradicts the multinational's brand as an eco-friendly business.

Documents obtained by Radio-Canada's Enquête program through an access-to-information request reveal more than 100 environmental infractions doled out to Rio Tinto's aluminum division in Quebec over the past 15 years.

The company has also paid $2.1 million in fines in that same period, making it the third biggest environmental offender in the province.

The company was fingered eight times for either neglecting or waiting to report problems related to pollution to Quebec's Environment Ministry. The documents include infractions for obstructing the work of public officials and failing to provide mandatory documents when required.

These infractions took place at Rio Tinto's massive Complexe Jonquière, and other nearby sites located around the city of Saguenay. The Complexe Jonquière is an industrial site that employs 1,500 people. It includes two aluminum plants, and various other refining, chemical and research facilities.

Rio Tinto's environmental missteps have come just as the company amasses tens of millions of dollars in public money.

Enquête also corroborated the company's spotty environmental record through a whistleblower who works at the Jonquière complex and whose identity it agreed to protect due to fear of professional reprisals.

In addition to looking into Rio Tinto's environmental practices in Quebec, Enquête also travelled to the heart of the Amazon forest in Brazil -- to a mine in which Rio Tinto has a 22 percent stake. It is where the company sources some of its bauxite.

There, local residents expressed their concerns about the mine's effects on the environment and the long-term health of people who live near it.

'We hide things all the time'

According to the whistleblower, the company has often resorted to hiding spills and altering a substance's colour by using gravel or dirt.

""We hide things all the time, and sweep them under the rug. It will take time to see all the things that are hidden, but it's starting to come out,"" says the source.

""Only the severity of the fine can make the company react.""

Rio Tinto declined our interview requests. In an email, it denied these allegations.

Rio Tinto Aluminium said ""it operates with a strict culture of environmental compliance which includes reporting spills to the competent authorities.""

""If an incident occurs, it is thoroughly investigated and corrective measures are put in place to prevent it from recurring,"" the company said.

In a letter made public on Friday, Rio Tinto says allegations of cover-ups, obstruction or delays are ""not our values and this is not how we behave.""

""Our 4,300 employees in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, like those around the world, are concerned about the legacy they will leave to their children,"" the letter states.

The industry has for years emphasized its green bonafides by claiming it uses clean hydroelectricity. Quebec aluminum plants emit less carbon dioxide than plants in China and elsewhere that are powered using coal.

But critics say plans that could have further reduced Rio Tinto's carbon emissions sooner were either never implemented or only materialized much later than promised.

""Investments [were promised] to modernize all the plants, which were outdated, aging, polluting and at the end of their useful lives,"" says Jacques Dubuc, who is now retired and used to work as a spokesperson for Alcan, which was bought by Rio Tinto in 2007.

He said ""we have a history of broken promises, partially kept promises, with excuses or tricks to try to prolong the life"" of aging plants.

In 2007, with talks brewing about the implementation of a cap-and-trade system in Quebec for carbon pollution, ""green aluminum"" started to become a common industry term. Aluminum producers that were among the province's biggest polluters were expected to have to start paying into the scheme which would have had an impact on profits.

But by playing up the concept of green aluminum behind the scenes, those companies were able to get exemptions, according to Marie-Claude Prémont, a professor at the École nationale d'administration publique.

""Green aluminum is a marketing tool,"" she said.

""It's a label that was assigned to an industry that barely changed in the last few decades.""

According to Prémont, ""the public needs more than just marketing"" to understand what is going on and to make informed decisions.

Rio Tinto, with its four aluminum smelters and its alumina refinery, still ranks among the province's 20 biggest polluters, and since 2007 its CO2 emissions have hardly budged.

In 2018, Elysis, a joint venture that includes Rio Tinto and Alcoa, was established as a research initiative meant to create aluminum with a zero carbon footprint. Since then, the Quebec and Canadian governments have doled out $160 million in subsidies.

On its website, Elysis claims it is developing a ""revolutionary"" and ""disruptive"" technology, even calling it ""non-polluting"" aluminum. But the technology that was supposed to come into large-scale production in the mid-2020s has quietly been pushed back to beyond 2030.

In an email, Elysis did not divulge its new timetable, saying it was concentrating on research and development.

Even if Elysis was fully implemented, between 1.3 and 2 tonnes of CO2 are generated per tonne of aluminum. That's because bauxite has to be extracted, shipped and refined to alumina before it is made into aluminum -- and each part of that process has a carbon footprint.

The wide margin of CO2 produced depends on whether the alumina is refined in Quebec or imported.

Rio Tinto will testify before a Parliamentary committee in Ottawa in April to provide an update on its program. It also says that a commercial prototype will come out later this year.

The company also says it is working systematically to further reduce emissions at each production stage.

The aluminum industry is expected to grow worldwide by almost 40 percent by 2030 due largely to increased demand from electric car manufacturers.

Tracing the production chain back to Brazil

Much of the bauxite used by Rio Tinto comes from a mine in the heart of the Amazon forest.

""To claim that your product is green is very serious, given the bauxite production chain. How can you call clearing the forest green? How can anyone say that digging up the soil is green?,"" asks Lilian Braga, a public prosecutor who works in the Amazonian state of Para near the mine run by Mineracao Rio Do Norte (MRN).

That ore deposit was discovered by Montreal-based Alcan in the 1960s. The mine has been shipping industrial quantities of bauxite to Quebec since 1979.

Because of the mine, ""people sometimes get sick,"" according to local activist Carlos Printes whose family has lived near the MRN owned mining town of Porto Trombetas for many years.

""Many people fall ill because of the company. But they do nothing for these people,"" he said.

Although there are no long-term public health studies that confirm this, other people living near the mine repeated these claims.

""People who drink this water get diarrhea and stomach aches. We can see that this is a water-related problem because not everyone has a well,"" says Raymundo Wilson, a village head who lives near Lake Batata.

MRN dumped 18 million cubic metres of bauxite residue into the lake from 1979 to 1989 in what some consider to be one of the most glaring cases of industrial pollution in the Amazon at the time. He told us that 60 out of 120 families living around the lake still don't have access to filtered well water.

Heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury can be released after bauxite is extracted from the ground. These can also get into water sources. Locals also worry about how safe the tailings dams are. These are similar to wet landfills and MRN has 29 of them where it put the tailings produced after bauxite was washed.

MRN's director of sustainability Vladimir Moreira told Enquête that mine tailings are inert and that there is no danger to human health. Asked if he would eat local fish, he replied: ""Of course I would.""

The company says it has ""around 250 monitoring stations for water, air and noise quality. And all these stations show that there is no contamination.""

""Our waste management system is absolutely safe,"" Moreira said. He added that the mine follows international standards and local communities participate in mine safety protocols.

In its open letter, Rio Tinto says it also works with MRN to ensure best practices are followed to improve environmental and social performance. These include robust reforestation efforts, and closely monitoring water quality and dam stability as well as health and education services to local communities.

Brazil has had a history of tailing dams ruptures with Mariana in 2015 and Brumadinho in 2019 which killed 19 and 272 people respectively. The latter had a type of dam construction known as upstream.

Vale, the company that owned the Brumadinho mine and was a 40 percent shareholder of MRN until 2023 said in a 2020 statement to the Security and Exchange Commission that MRN had dams similar to those at Brumadinho.

Tthe rupture of any of these structures could cause loss of lives and serious personal, property and environmental damages,"" Vale said in its statement.

Jose Domingos, a farmer who lives near Lake Sapucua, which is downstream of the dams, says the threat of an environmental disaster constantly hangs over local communities.

""If one day, there is a possible problem for the 16 communities of Lake Sapucua, it's over for us, you understand?"" Domingos said. ""We can't sleep at night during the winter, because it rains so much.""

MRN commissioned studies that allowed it to get its dam classifications changed with the Brazilian government's mining oversight body. Dams that were classified as upstream, a category widely considered more dangerous, were given a different designation.

Moreira says that the geography where MRN has its tailings reservoirs is different from what existed in Mariana and Bruhmadino.

But at least one expert questions those reclassifications.

If there's any doubt a dam, a preventative approach should be used to ""ensure the protection of people and the environment,"" said Andressa Lanchotti, who sat on the prosecution team in the Bruhmadino case.

Rio Tinto says it is aware of the concerns associated with bauxite mining in Brazil.

""We are working tirelessly to improve our operations by promoting a circular economy and furthering the environmental, social and governance best practices throughout our entire supply chain, from mine to consumer,"" said Nina Mankovitz, vice-president at Rio Tinto Aluminium.

Billions in subsidies and financial benefits in Quebec

""To call it green aluminum is greenwashing,"" said Martine Ouellet, a former Quebec minister of natural resources who now heads a small political party dedicated to fighting climate change.

Ouellet, who was also head of special projects at Hydro-Québec, estimates that with greenhouse gas fee exemptions, tax rebates and through use of their privately-owned dams, Rio Tinto gets about 1.2 billion dollars a year in subsidies .

Rio Tinto says that most of the projects it initiated since 2020, totalling $2 billion in investments, did not get government subsidies.

Elysis has gotten buy-in from major brands like Apple, Michelob and BMW, who plan to purchase this product once it is available.

But the aluminum industry is asking for even more funding.

In early March 2024, the Aluminium Association of Canada asked the Quebec government to continue subsidizing electricity for aluminum and for more investments in Elysis. These subsidies and financial benefits could cost taxpayers further billions over the coming years.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.2156862745098039,448964096,18,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BSSzHF8GhVh2BNtHqYojMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/2c4d5d8f10b025b6e497e55dd7c9520f,

The funding aims to boost Zambia's efforts to curb rapid agricultural expansion into forests and woodlands, to help protect nature and cut emissions from deforestation that contribute to climate change.

The money, announced on International Day of Forests, will help train farmers in rotating and diversifying crops and more efficient irrigation, as part of steps to prevent clearance of forests for cultivated land and improve food security.

It will also support the planting of trees alongside crops in a practice known as agroforestry, which can protect food plants from rising temperatures, provide wood and store carbon.

It will enable 100,000 smallholder farmers to be trained in the climate-smart practices at 200 new ""farmer field schools"", to reduce poverty and bolster people's resilience to climate change.

Farmers will also get access to digital technology such as a new app providing climate updates to help them cope with changing weather patterns, suggesting optimum times for planting or harvesting crops.

The investment is part of the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes, a global programme to support projects that reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable land use and conservation of forests.

Officials said the new funding came on top of more than £115 million it had already provided to the scheme since 2013, and was part of the UK's efforts to protect and restore nature and tackle climate change, building on the deal at Cop26 in Glasgow to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030.

Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""We can't tackle climate change without protecting nature, which is why we are committed to helping other countries, such as Zambia.

""The destruction of forests across the world accounts for around 10 times the emissions of the UK - so we must do everything we can to safeguard our environment for future generations.""

The initiatives backed by the funding could cut Zambia's emissions by around three million tonnes, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.

It builds on the African country's work under the programme so far, which includes 190,000 hectares now managed using climate-smart agriculture, 478 new farmer field schools, training 115,000 farmers and five million seedlings distributed for agroforestry.

Chief Nyamphande of Nyamphande Chiefdom in Lusangazi District, Eastern Zambia, a community which has benefited from the programme, said: ""The programme has helped us diversify into new areas of farming, such as bee keeping and fish farming, enabling us to lessen our dependency on seasonal crops that are affected by droughts and other effects of climate change.

""It is gratifying that the programme is getting additional funding from the UK, as its continuation is vital for the sustainability of the progress we have made in adapting to smarter, climate sensitive agricultural practices in our province.""",southwestfarmer.co.uk,news,South West Farmer,,0.419607843137255,448964089,1,https://www.southwestfarmer.co.uk/resources/images/17239347/,

(Credit: Hylio)

A new exemption for drone piloting from the Federal Aviation Administration has cleared the airways for ""drone-swarm"" agriculture, a method of seeding and spraying crops at a fraction of the traditional cost.

Hylio, a Texas-based drone manufacturer, successfully applied for an exemption from the FAA to allow fleets of drones weighing 55 pounds or more to fly together.

It's the first exception of its kind for machines that carry what the company calls a ""meaningful payload"" and makes the process competitive with traditional tractors and seeding rigs.

""On average, you're spending a quarter both up front, capital cost to buy the machinery, and operating cost is about a quarter or maybe a third of what you'd spend for the traditional stuff,"" Arthur Erickson, Hylio's CEO, told Fox News Digital.

SEE IT: AMAZON'S NEW PRIME DRONE IN ACTION

Even a set of three drones costs substantially less than a single tractor. They use less water to carry chemicals, causing less soil compaction, and only a fraction of the fuel for generators to recharge batteries in the field. And Hylio doesn't charge a subscription fee for its software, Erickson said.

Under previous rules, a single drone required a pilot and another person acting as a spotter. Because of weight limitations in flight, it took a long time to cover large fields.

Now the two-person team can fly up to three drones at once in a ""swarm,"" covering triple the area in the same time, making it almost as fast as a conventional tractor.

TRACTOR HACK: FARMERS ARE HARNESSING HACKED SOFTWARE FOR JOHN DEERE REPAIRS

Andy Kreikemeier, a Nebraska farmer behind Infinity Precision Ag, says he began using drones about six months ago, primarily in hard-to-reach places.

In addition to the pilot and the spotter, his operation also includes a third person to refill the drone.

""Now we can run three drones with two people with this exemption,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""So, not only are we increasing our coverage time frame with using three drones, but we're lessening the time and the amount of people we have to have on site.""

With another pilot and another tracker, he could run a fleet of six drones at the same time and cover even more ground without running over crops or compacting more soil under the wheels.

Drones begin at around $50,000 per unit, according to Hylio. A conventional tractor can cost more than $300,000, with some high-end models going for over $700,000.

""They're so expensive,"" Erickson said. ""Over half a million for a brand-new tractor these days, while we're still reeling from the COVID stuff, supply train issues.""

Kreikemeier said he paid about $80,000 each for his fully-loaded drones from Hylio.

The machines have a multitude of uses, Erickson said.

The partnership will proceed under an agreement Mote signed March 5 with representatives of Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation, Taiwan's National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA) and the National Museum of Marine Science and Technology (NMMST).

The memo of understanding, signed while Mote President & CEO Michael Crosby was giving a presentation in Taiwan, is the first of its type between a major U.S. marine research and science education institution and counterparts in Taiwan. It will allow for exchange of technologies and cross training for scientists, with training manuals generated in both English and Mandarin.

Delta, a global provider of power and thermal management solutions, strives to address key environmental issues with innovative technology and has developed a coral restoration project with the two aquariums in Taiwan with a goal of restoring 10,000 corals over three years through continued efforts in propagation and breeding.

The memo makes Mote a critical partner in that effort.

The key piece of technology developed by Mote is its Climate and Acidification Ocean Simulator - CAOS system for short - used at Mote's Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research & Restoration on Summerland Key.

That system allows coral biologists to test the impact of climate change - including ocean acidification and warming temperatures - and helps them predict what types can thrive as conditions degrade.

The agreement follows a record-breaking underwater heat wave that started in July 2023 and devastated much of the Florida Reef Tract.

In the aftermath, Mote biologists documented how genetically enhanced cross-bred elkhorn corals planted at the Mission: Iconic Reefs site and genetically enhanced cross-bred staghorn corals survived the near catastrophic warming event.

""It's the genetic based resiliency approach that Mote really pioneered for coral restoration that is really the basis for this research collaboration,"" Crosby said. ""That's where we have advanced experience there and so we'll be helping them begin that effort as well in Taiwan.""

Mote biologists are still studying corals in the keys to expand their comprehensive asexual and sexual reproduction methods for producing genetically resilient coral, and share their findings with partners in Taiwan and around the world.

The Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation sent representatives to Mote last year to watch its coral bleaching rescue effort at work.

""We are honored to officially collaborate with Mote this year and will provide funding to support researchers at the NMMBA and the NMMST,"" Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation said in a news release. ""Additionally, we will send volunteers from Delta's coral restoration project to the United States for exchange and learning. We hope that by enhancing coral bleaching early warning and rescue mechanisms, we can better prepare for the next coral bleaching event in Taiwan.""

Crosby explained that some of the scenarios Mote scientists create with the CAOS system actually occur in the Western Pacific Ocean near Taiwan.

Taiwan is at the northern tip of one of the most highly diverse coral reef regions in the world, Crosby said. The thermal effluent of a power plant has heated the water in one portion of the reef tract, resulting in corals that have genetically adapted to the higher temperatures.

Meanwhile not far off the reef, the ocean gets deeper, with seasonal and tidal fluctuations producing deep water upwelling that can bring the corals in contact with significantly cooler water.

""So it's a little bit of a microcosm for what we might be forecasting are possible temperatures in the coming decades,"" Crosby said.

""We can do some very interesting compare and contrasts with what Mother Nature herself is doing with respect to the oceans,"" he added.

A workstation developed by Delta and showcased at Crosby's presentation and the signing ceremony, allows biologists to study the skeleton of a living coral that otherwise would have to be killed and dissected.

Crosby explained that the microscope uses a sensor similar to that in a CAT scan that allows a scientist to look at the calcium carbonate skeleton where a coral polyp resides and measure the impact of ocean acidification. In the demonstration, the live coral sample was visible on a laptop screen while the lattice like skeleton was displayed on a larger monitor.

""This is a way to do it with a living coral sample and to follow that same individual polyp or colony of corals over the course of months, years and decades to follow the impacts of different ocean acidification levels - or Ph levels - and intersect that with questions of variability and temperature.""

An adjacent aquarium on that display demonstrated how brooding coral larvae can be captured in nursing and spawning tanks.

Expect to see those stations in a STEM workforce development lab and teaching labs on the first floor of Mote SEA - where volunteers and students will have a hands-on experience while learning about the ocean.

The partnership is the latest example of Mote's International Marine Science Diplomacy Initiative.

Mote is already working with Japan, Chile and Korea to expand its US Harmful Algal Bloom Control Technologies Incubator; its Global FinPrint project - a shark survey with 58 nations that prompted new international trade regulations - coral reef research in Mozambique and sharks and rays conservation work in Belize.

""Oceans and ocean resources really have no political boundaries other than to human beings who draw lines on a map,"" Crosby said. ""By working together we can share knowledge, exchange knowledge, learn from each other - not just the scientists but the entire communities and the next generation as well.""

While some of that education may include virtual partnerships across time zones, much of it will be accomplished through exchanges, with U.S.-based citizen scientists and students traveling to the sister aquariums in Taiwan and Taiwanese students and citizen scientists coming to Sarasota.

""Mote SEA is just going to be incredible,"" Crosby said. ""Everything is about science in that it is not our grandparents' aquarium - it is unlike any other aquarium in any place in the world and it's right here in our backyard.

""We're going to really enhance the experiential opportunities of these high school students in all aspects of the research that we do,"" Crosby said. ""The impacts of this international marine science diplomacy initiative go beyond the innovative science and technology.""

Current progress calls for a soft opening of Mote SEA later this year and an official opening in early 2025.

That opening will clear the way for expansion of research and hospital facilities on City Island.

Though not officially, Crosby has occasionally referred to the existing City Island site as the Mote International Marine Science and Technology Innovation Park.

Crosby declined to comment on a proposal by Ride Entertainment Sarasota to develop a portion of Ken Thompson Park through a public-private partnership but stressed that Mote is going to need all of its 10.5 acres there as the campus transforms.

""We are going to be adding 60,000 square feet of research infrastructure to what we already have,"" Crosby said. ""We will have over 100,000 square feet of state-of the-art research infrastructure.""

In addition to research facilities, Crosby said Mote's marine hospital and rescue and rehabilitation facilities will expand.

""There will be so much for people to see here that yes, there will be quite a few visitors,"" Crosby said. ""We ain't going nowhere; we're going to get bigger and better on City Island, once we give a rebirth to the Aquarium as the new Mote Science Education Aquarium.""

Mote's long-term strategic plan calls for City Island to become a catalyst for what Crosby foresees as an opportunity for Southwest Florida to really become a Silicon Valley of marine science and technology.

""It's going to attract scientists and engineers literally from all around the world to come here to Sarasota,"" he said. ""That intellectual property that comes out of all of this is going to be the foundation of growing new companies.

""Innovators and entrepreneurs can grow science and tech based businesses that can provide jobs for the next generation that are compatible with what we have as a culture here that is so intimately linked to our environment.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2470588235294118,448963985,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27z_pZI3n3yzzmGHwY8wbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/herald-tribune/52e75dced064c2dd7fb19380357ddc5f,eng-9414196

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",unitedkingdomnews.net,news,United Kingdom News,,0.3098039215686275,448963736,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

Investigation shows environmental gaps from Quebec to the Amazon,"At times, Rio Tinto has spilled dangerous chemicals at several of its Quebec sites without disclosing it to the provincial government -- behaviour that contradicts the multinational's brand as an eco-friendly business.

Documents obtained by Radio-Canada's Enquête program through an access-to-information request reveal more than 100 environmental infractions doled out to Rio Tinto's aluminum division in Quebec over the past 15 years.

The company has also paid $2.1 million in fines in that same period, making it the third biggest environmental offender in the province.

The company was fingered eight times for either neglecting or waiting to report problems related to pollution to Quebec's Environment Ministry. The documents include infractions for obstructing the work of public officials and failing to provide mandatory documents when required.

These infractions took place at Rio Tinto's massive Complexe Jonquière, and other nearby sites located around the city of Saguenay. The Complexe Jonquière is an industrial site that employs 1,500 people. It includes two aluminum plants, and various other refining, chemical and research facilities.

Rio Tinto's environmental missteps have come just as the company amasses tens of millions of dollars in public money.

Enquête also corroborated the company's spotty environmental record through a whistleblower who works at the Jonquière complex and whose identity it agreed to protect due to fear of professional reprisals.

In addition to looking into Rio Tinto's environmental practices in Quebec, Enquête also travelled to the heart of the Amazon forest in Brazil -- to a mine in which Rio Tinto has a 22 percent stake. It is where the company sources some of its bauxite.

There, local residents expressed their concerns about the mine's effects on the environment and the long-term health of people who live near it.

'We hide things all the time'

According to the whistleblower, the company has often resorted to hiding spills and altering a substance's colour by using gravel or dirt.

""We hide things all the time, and sweep them under the rug. It will take time to see all the things that are hidden, but it's starting to come out,"" says the source.

""Only the severity of the fine can make the company react.""

Rio Tinto declined our interview requests. In an email, it denied these allegations.

Rio Tinto Aluminium said ""it operates with a strict culture of environmental compliance which includes reporting spills to the competent authorities.""

""If an incident occurs, it is thoroughly investigated and corrective measures are put in place to prevent it from recurring,"" the company said.

Marie-Claude Prémont is a professor with the École nationale d'administration publique. (Priscilla Plamondon Lalancette/Radio-Canada)

In a letter made public on Friday, Rio Tinto says allegations of cover-ups, obstruction or delays are ""not our values and this is not how we behave.""

""Our 4,300 employees in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, like those around the world, are concerned about the legacy they will leave to their children,"" the letter states.

The industry has for years emphasized its green bonafides by claiming it uses clean hydroelectricity. Quebec aluminum plants emit less carbon dioxide than plants in China and elsewhere that are powered using coal.

But critics say plans that could have further reduced Rio Tinto's carbon emissions sooner were either never implemented or only materialized much later than promised.

""Investments [were promised] to modernize all the plants, which were outdated, aging, polluting and at the end of their useful lives,"" says Jacques Dubuc, who is now retired and used to work as a spokesperson for Alcan, which was bought by Rio Tinto in 2007.

He said ""we have a history of broken promises, partially kept promises, with excuses or tricks to try to prolong the life"" of aging plants.

In 2007, with talks brewing about the implementation of a cap-and-trade system in Quebec for carbon pollution, ""green aluminum"" started to become a common industry term. Aluminum producers that were among the province's biggest polluters were expected to have to start paying into the scheme which would have had an impact on profits.

But by playing up the concept of green aluminum behind the scenes, those companies were able to get exemptions, according to Marie-Claude Prémont, a professor at the École nationale d'administration publique.

""Green aluminum is a marketing tool,"" she said.

""It's a label that was assigned to an industry that barely changed in the last few decades.""

According to Prémont, ""the public needs more than just marketing"" to understand what is going on and to make informed decisions.

Rio Tinto, with its four aluminum smelters and its alumina refinery, still ranks among the province's 20 biggest polluters, and since 2007 its CO2 emissions have hardly budged.

In 2018, Elysis, a joint venture that includes Rio Tinto and Alcoa, was established as a research initiative meant to create aluminum with a zero carbon footprint. Since then, the Quebec and Canadian governments have doled out $160 million in subsidies.

On its website, Elysis claims it is developing a ""revolutionary"" and ""disruptive"" technology, even calling it ""non-polluting"" aluminum. But the technology that was supposed to come into large-scale production in the mid-2020s has quietly been pushed back to beyond 2030.

In an email, Elysis did not divulge its new timetable, saying it was concentrating on research and development.

Even if Elysis was fully implemented, between 1.3 and 2 tonnes of CO2 are generated per tonne of aluminum. That's because bauxite has to be extracted, shipped and refined to alumina before it is made into aluminum -- and each part of that process has a carbon footprint.

The wide margin of CO2 produced depends on whether the alumina is refined in Quebec or imported.

Rio Tinto will testify before a Parliamentary committee in Ottawa in April to provide an update on its program. It also says that a commercial prototype will come out later this year.

The company also says it is working systematically to further reduce emissions at each production stage.

The aluminum industry is expected to grow worldwide by almost 40 percent by 2030 due largely to increased demand from electric car manufacturers.

Tracing the production chain back to Brazil

Much of the bauxite used by Rio Tinto comes from a mine in the heart of the Amazon forest.

""To claim that your product is green is very serious, given the bauxite production chain. How can you call clearing the forest green? How can anyone say that digging up the soil is green?,"" asks Lilian Braga, a public prosecutor who works in the Amazonian state of Para near the mine run by Mineracao Rio Do Norte (MRN).

That ore deposit was discovered by Montreal-based Alcan in the 1960s. The mine has been shipping industrial quantities of bauxite to Quebec since 1979.

Because of the mine, ""people sometimes get sick,"" according to local activist Carlos Printes whose family has lived near the MRN owned mining town of Porto Trombetas for many years.

""Many people fall ill because of the company. But they do nothing for these people,"" he said.

Although there are no long-term public health studies that confirm this, other people living near the mine repeated these claims.

""People who drink this water get diarrhea and stomach aches. We can see that this is a water-related problem because not everyone has a well,"" says Raymundo Wilson, a village head who lives near Lake Batata.

MRN dumped 18 million cubic metres of bauxite residue into the lake from 1979 to 1989 in what some consider to be one of the most glaring cases of industrial pollution in the Amazon at the time. He told us that 60 out of 120 families living around the lake still don't have access to filtered well water.

Heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury can be released after bauxite is extracted from the ground. These can also get into water sources. Locals also worry about how safe the tailings dams are. These are similar to wet landfills and MRN has 29 of them where it put the tailings produced after bauxite was washed.

MRN's director of sustainability Vladimir Moreira told Enquête that mine tailings are inert and that there is no danger to human health. Asked if he would eat local fish, he replied: ""Of course I would.""

The company says it has ""around 250 monitoring stations for water, air and noise quality. And all these stations show that there is no contamination.""

""Our waste management system is absolutely safe,"" Moreira said. He added that the mine follows international standards and local communities participate in mine safety protocols.

In its open letter, Rio Tinto says it also works with MRN to ensure best practices are followed to improve environmental and social performance. These include robust reforestation efforts, and closely monitoring water quality and dam stability as well as health and education services to local communities.

Brazil has had a history of tailing dams ruptures with Mariana in 2015 and Brumadinho in 2019 which killed 19 and 272 people respectively. The latter had a type of dam construction known as upstream.

Vale, the company that owned the Brumadinho mine and was a 40 percent shareholder of MRN until 2023 said in a 2020 statement to the Security and Exchange Commission that MRN had dams similar to those at Brumadinho.

Tthe rupture of any of these structures could cause loss of lives and serious personal, property and environmental damages,"" Vale said in its statement.

Jose Domingos, a farmer who lives near Lake Sapucua, which is downstream of the dams, says the threat of an environmental disaster constantly hangs over local communities.

""If one day, there is a possible problem for the 16 communities of Lake Sapucua, it's over for us, you understand?"" Domingos said. ""We can't sleep at night during the winter, because it rains so much.""

MRN commissioned studies that allowed it to get its dam classifications changed with the Brazilian government's mining oversight body. Dams that were classified as upstream, a category widely considered more dangerous, were given a different designation.

Moreira says that the geography where MRN has its tailings reservoirs is different from what existed in Mariana and Bruhmadino.

Parts of Lake Batata in the Amazon rainforest remain red. (Radio-Canada)

But at least one expert questions those reclassifications.

Billions in subsidies and financial benefits in Quebec

""To call it green aluminum is greenwashing,"" said Martine Ouellet, a former Quebec minister of natural resources who now heads a small political party dedicated to fighting climate change.

Ouellet, who was also head of special projects at Hydro-Québec, estimates that with greenhouse gas fee exemptions, tax rebates and through use of their privately-owned dams, Rio Tinto gets about 1.2 billion dollars a year in subsidies .

Rio Tinto says that most of the projects it initiated since 2020, totalling $2 billion in investments, did not get government subsidies.

Elysis has gotten buy-in from major brands like Apple, Michelob and BMW, who plan to purchase this product once it is available.

But the aluminum industry is asking for even more funding.

In early March 2024, the Aluminium Association of Canada asked the Quebec government to continue subsidizing electricity for aluminum and for more investments in Elysis.

According to him, more than three thousand subscribers in Nikopol and over 6.4 thousand in the district were left without electricity. He noted that the power supply in the area was allegedly restored.

On March 23, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council, Nikolay Lukashuk, stated that in Nikopol, infrastructure facilities and power transmission lines were damaged as a result of explosions.

Early in the morning on March 22, Russian military forces launched massive missile strikes on energy infrastructure facilities in various cities in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense referred to these attacks as ""retaliatory strikes.""

Russian military forces began targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, shortly after the explosion on the Crimean Bridge. Since then, air raid sirens have been regularly announced in various regions of Ukraine, often across the entire country. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the attacks target objects in the energy sector, defense industry, military command, and communication.

The regulation is designed to force two-thirds of new light-duty cars and 46% of medium duty autos sold in the United States to be electric vehicles by 2032, one of the more hare-brained schemes that make up the Biden Green New Deal energy policies.

In the press release accompanying the new rule, the EPA boasts that the new mandates ""will avoid more than 7 billion tons of carbon emissions and provide nearly $100 billion of annual net benefits to society, including $13 billion of annual public health benefits due to improved air quality, and $62 billion in reduced annual fuel costs,"" all of which is so much nonsense that no one really believes it. But this kind of fantasy narrative forms the very foundation of current Democrat party thinking on energy and climate policy.

In a statement, Tom Pyle, President of the American Energy Alliance, fired back at the EPA talking points, calling the regulation ""another example of President Biden's assault on the middle class."" Pyle correctly points out that the new rules ""will make cars more expensive and ultimately make fewer cars available for Americans. By now, we have gotten used to incredibly damaging and stupid rules from the Biden administration, but this one is in a class by itself.""

But of course, raising the price for a new car in the United States is a feature of the Green New Deal policies pushed by Biden and his regulators, not a glitch. According to data kept by the St. Louis office of the Federal Reserve, the consumer price index when Biden assumed office in January, 2021 stood at 150.131. By February of 2024, that had skyrocketed to 179.311, a rise of 14% in just three years. By contrast, the index rose by just 1% during the first term of Donald Trump.

It is no secret that increasing the cost of energy is a central goal of the climate-alarm activist movement, not just in the United States but across the globe. The conceit there being that if you can force energy costs high enough and fast enough to make them unbearable to ordinary consumers, you will force people to conserve, i.e., do without. As Pyle correctly points out, it is a direct assault on the middle and lower classes in society, given the fact that rising energy costs essentially function as a regressive tax that impacting the poorest classes the hardest.

This is the core belief system that controls policy in the Democrat party today. It is simply beyond question at this point - literally every action this administration takes related to energy policy is designed to intentionally increase the cost for energy for every American. Consumers see it in the rising price for gas at the pump - more than 50% higher today than it was when Biden took office. They see it in skyrocketing home utility bills. They see it in irrational Biden policy actions like pushing offshore wind industrial projects, where big developers continue to demand more subsidies and higher rate guarantees before moving forward. They see it in the administration's policies designed to depress the domestic oil and gas industry. They see it in policies intentionally designed to destroy reliability on the nation's power grid.

And now they see it in this new EPA power grab. It comes after U.S. automakers have spent the last half year scaling back their plans for EV development and begging the administration to reconsider its irrational, destructive approach in light of the slowing demand for such cars and the ensuing massive financial losses. The vast majority of Americans simply do not want to own an EV, and forcing automakers to manufacture them regardless of market demand is the surest way to create the ""bloodbath"" in the domestic industry that Trump predicted last week.

It is madness, plain and simple, and if voters give this administration another four years in office, disaster will become inevitable.

There's one plant celebrity gardener and horticulturist David Domoney urges gardeners not to cut away this spring if you want lush green lawns.

As spring arrives and the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, it's a great time to start getting your garden summertime ready - but according to the pro gardener, there's one mistake people are making with their grass.

As much as we all strive for a well-trimmed and pristine lawns, the pro suggests gardeners should avoid neatly cutting their grass for the first cut of the year.

Ahead of this year's Ideal Home Show, David Domoney spoke to The Mirror to share his top tips when it comes to all things lawn care.

Knowing gardeners may be wiping off the cobwebs on their lawnmowers this weekend, David gave some top words of wisdom tip for the first cut.

He urged green-fingered homeowners to leave some of your garden wild for the best results. ""Dandelions are a great food source for pollinators, so try to leave some areas a little wild to not cut out the positives and let them flourish,"" he explained.

Although many people class dandelions as weeds, the little yellow plants actually fertilise your grass. Instead of acting as a lawn killer, they work hard doing the opposite, as David highlighted, feeding birds, bees and butterflies. Their wide-spreading roots also help to loosen hard soil as well as aerate the earth.

Another top tip from David is avoid getting too chop-happy. ""The secret is to give it a high cut and not too short,"" he revealed.

After a wet winter, David reckons we're in for a lush green summer as he said: ""Spring is when the garden comes back to life, it hasn't been a cold winter but it has definitely been a wet winter so I think it will be a green summer, we are seeing a fluctuation nature and it's great.""

David also warned gardeners to not cut their grass when wet and also suggested the first cut should be done in a ""high setting"".

David Domoney was speaking from The Dream Home at the Ideal Home Show, taking place at Olympia London from Friday 22nd March to Sunday 7th April.

Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium will collaborate with two aquariums in Taiwan and the philanthropic foundation of a leading Taiwanese electronics manufacturer to advance research on heat-resilient coral and coral restoration, as well as expanding citizen scientists' impact on those efforts.

The partnership will proceed under an agreement Mote signed March 5 with representatives of Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation, Taiwan's National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA) and the National Museum of Marine Science and Technology (NMMST).

The memo of understanding, signed while Mote President & CEO Michael Crosby was giving a presentation in Taiwan, is the first of its type between a major U.S. marine research and science education institution and counterparts in Taiwan. It will allow for exchange of technologies and cross training for scientists, with training manuals generated in both English and Mandarin.

Delta, a global provider of power and thermal management solutions, strives to address key environmental issues with innovative technology and has developed a coral restoration project with the two aquariums in Taiwan with a goal of restoring 10,000 corals over three years through continued efforts in propagation and breeding.

The memo makes Mote a critical partner in that effort.

The key piece of technology developed by Mote is its Climate and Acidification Ocean Simulator - CAOS system for short - used at Mote's Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research & Restoration on Summerland Key.

That system allows coral biologists to test the impact of climate change - including ocean acidification and warming temperatures - and helps them predict what types can thrive as conditions degrade.

Underwater heatwave proved resiliency efforts work

The agreement follows a record-breaking underwater heat wave that started in July 2023 and devastated much of the Florida Reef Tract.

In the aftermath, Mote biologists documented how genetically enhanced cross-bred elkhorn corals planted at the Mission: Iconic Reefs site and genetically enhanced cross-bred staghorn corals survived the near catastrophic warming event.

""It's the genetic based resiliency approach that Mote really pioneered for coral restoration that is really the basis for this research collaboration,"" Crosby said. ""That's where we have advanced experience there and so we'll be helping them begin that effort as well in Taiwan.""

Mote biologists are still studying corals in the keys to expand their comprehensive asexual and sexual reproduction methods for producing genetically resilient coral, and share their findings with partners in Taiwan and around the world.

The Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation sent representatives to Mote last year to watch its coral bleaching rescue effort at work.

""We are honored to officially collaborate with Mote this year and will provide funding to support researchers at the NMMBA and the NMMST,"" Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation said in a news release. ""Additionally, we will send volunteers from Delta's coral restoration project to the United States for exchange and learning. We hope that by enhancing coral bleaching early warning and rescue mechanisms, we can better prepare for the next coral bleaching event in Taiwan.""

Crosby explained that some of the scenarios Mote scientists create with the CAOS system actually occur in the Western Pacific Ocean near Taiwan.

Taiwan is at the northern tip of one of the most highly diverse coral reef regions in the world, Crosby said. The thermal effluent of a power plant has heated the water in one portion of the reef tract, resulting in corals that have genetically adapted to the higher temperatures.

Meanwhile not far off the reef, the ocean gets deeper, with seasonal and tidal fluctuations producing deep water upwelling that can bring the corals in contact with significantly cooler water.

""So it's a little bit of a microcosm for what we might be forecasting are possible temperatures in the coming decades,"" Crosby said.

""We can do some very interesting compare and contrasts with what Mother Nature herself is doing with respect to the oceans,"" he added.

Revolutionary technology

A workstation developed by Delta and showcased at Crosby's presentation and the signing ceremony, allows biologists to study the skeleton of a living coral that otherwise would have to be killed and dissected.

Crosby explained that the microscope uses a sensor similar to that in a CAT scan that allows a scientist to look at the calcium carbonate skeleton where a coral polyp resides and measure the impact of ocean acidification. In the demonstration, the live coral sample was visible on a laptop screen while the lattice like skeleton was displayed on a larger monitor.

""This is a way to do it with a living coral sample and to follow that same individual polyp or colony of corals over the course of months, years and decades to follow the impacts of different ocean acidification levels - or Ph levels - and intersect that with questions of variability and temperature.""

An adjacent aquarium on that display demonstrated how brooding coral larvae can be captured in nursing and spawning tanks.

Marine science diplomacy

Expect to see those stations in a STEM workforce development lab and teaching labs on the first floor of Mote SEA - where volunteers and students will have a hands-on experience while learning about the ocean.

The partnership is the latest example of Mote's International Marine Science Diplomacy Initiative.

Mote is already working with Japan, Chile and Korea to expand its US Harmful Algal Bloom Control Technologies Incubator; its Global FinPrint project - a shark survey with 58 nations that prompted new international trade regulations - coral reef research in Mozambique and sharks and rays conservation work in Belize.

""Oceans and ocean resources really have no political boundaries other than to human beings who draw lines on a map,"" Crosby said. ""By working together we can share knowledge, exchange knowledge, learn from each other - not just the scientists but the entire communities and the next generation as well.""

While some of that education may include virtual partnerships across time zones, much of it will be accomplished through exchanges, with U.S.-based citizen scientists and students traveling to the sister aquariums in Taiwan and Taiwanese students and citizen scientists coming to Sarasota.

""Mote SEA is just going to be incredible,"" Crosby said. ""Everything is about science in that it is not our grandparents' aquarium - it is unlike any other aquarium in any place in the world and it's right here in our backyard.

""We're going to really enhance the experiential opportunities of these high school students in all aspects of the research that we do,"" Crosby said. ""The impacts of this international marine science diplomacy initiative go beyond the innovative science and technology.""

Current progress calls for a soft opening of Mote SEA later this year and an official opening in early 2025.

That opening will clear the way for expansion of research and hospital facilities on City Island.

Visions of an international research campus

Though not officially, Crosby has occasionally referred to the existing City Island site as the Mote International Marine Science and Technology Innovation Park.

Crosby declined to comment on a proposal by Ride Entertainment Sarasota to develop a portion of Ken Thompson Park through a public-private partnership but stressed that Mote is going to need all of its 10.5 acres there as the campus transforms.

""We are going to be adding 60,000 square feet of research infrastructure to what we already have,"" Crosby said. ""We will have over 100,000 square feet of state-of the-art research infrastructure.""

In addition to research facilities, Crosby said Mote's marine hospital and rescue and rehabilitation facilities will expand.

""There will be so much for people to see here that yes, there will be quite a few visitors,"" Crosby said. ""We ain't going nowhere; we're going to get bigger and better on City Island, once we give a rebirth to the Aquarium as the new Mote Science Education Aquarium.""

Mote's long-term strategic plan calls for City Island to become a catalyst for what Crosby foresees as an opportunity for Southwest Florida to really become a Silicon Valley of marine science and technology.

""It's going to attract scientists and engineers literally from all around the world to come here to Sarasota,"" he said. ""That intellectual property that comes out of all of this is going to be the foundation of growing new companies.

""Innovators and entrepreneurs can grow science and tech based businesses that can provide jobs for the next generation that are compatible with what we have as a culture here that is so intimately linked to our environment.""",eu.heraldtribune.com,news,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,,0.3098039215686275,448963665,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/20/NSHT/73042111007-sar-coraltaiwan-01.jpg?auto=webp&crop=9495,5344,x5,y332&format=pjpg&width=1200",eng-9414196

If you're looking for a flick that packs a punch and delves into the murky world of South African politics, mark your calendars for 29 March, when Heart of the Hunter makes its Netflix premiere.

Leading man Sisanda Henna, who plays Deputy President Ntima, the corrupt politician at the heart of the story, lets Drum in on what to expect.

Now, picture this: a post-democratic South Africa where a retired assassin (played by Bonko Khoza) is pulled back into action and has to fight to protect his family by morphing into a battle against a power-hungry politician eyeing the presidential seat.

That's the canvas upon which Heart of the Hunter, directed by Mandlakayise Walter Dube, unfolds. It's the on-screen adaptation of the gripping novel by South African luminary Deon Meyer.

As we chat, Sisanda, born on March 18, 1983, gives off an infectious energy.

He's been in the industry for 22 years yet his passion for storytelling is still palpable.

""I think Tim, the producer, Willem Grubler and Deon Meyer who are the writers, and Mandla, the director, were tapping into a lot of contemporary political themes through my character of Deputy President Ntima,"" Sisanda muses when asked about the relevance of the corruption theme today.

""For me, it was a lot of fun to draw inspiration from real-life characters,"" he continues.

When pressed about which current South African politicians specifically influenced his portrayal, he slyly deflects, leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.

""I think it's gonna be quite interesting to hear from viewers who they think my character depicts,"" he says with a grin.

But what drew him to the role in the first place?

""The team behind the movie,"" he answers without hesitation. ""I've always wanted to work with Tim and Mandla. And to top it all off, I wanted to work on a Netflix original,"" he adds with a chuckle.

As for what viewers should take away from the film, Sisanda keeps it refreshingly straightforward. ""The first thing is we want people to flippin' have a good time and just enjoy the proudly South African Netflix Blockbuster,"" he says, his enthusiasm infectious.

Beyond Heart of the Hunter, Sisanda has been keeping busy.

""There's another Netflix project called Soon Come the Night, which is a limited series and is already out,"" he shares.

But how did a guy who studied IT end up in the acting world?

His campus was in Auckland Park, a few blocks up from the SABC studios, where all the soapies where being filmed, Sisanda remembers.

One day he strolled from campus to the SABC and told them he wanted to give it a shot.

""Sure, it wasn't a leading gig, but it was a start. And you know what they say about being in the right place at the right time, right?""",snl24.com,news,Soccer Laduma,,0.1686274509803922,448963647,1,https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10951/72d6b87bb98146148eae17f6c7333144.jpg,

They then proceeded into the concert hall and similarly started to mow down the audience.According to the latest data from the Russian Investigative Committee, 133 people died. Suspects DetainedFollowing the wanton killing, the gunmen fled the scene unscathed leaving the concert hall on fire with hundreds dead and wounded - some burnt, some asphyxiated and others buried under falling debris from the roof.Soldiers of the Akhmat-Russia regiment of the Russian Ministry of Defense, stationed in the Bryansk region, detained the four shooters in the Bryansk region, about 340 km away from Moscow, and just 100 km from the border with Ukraine!They were in a Renault Symbol car which jumped a checkpoint. Security forces chased the car and fired upon it. While trying to escape, the car overturned.One terrorist was detained on the spot, the rest fled into the forest. As a result of the search, a second suspect was found and detained at approximately 3:50 a.m.A PM pistol, a magazine for an AKM assault rifle and passports of citizens of Tajikistan were found in the Renault car.The detainees have been transferred to Moscow.Investigation ResultsAccording to the FSB central intelligence centre, the weapons used by the terrorists at Crocus were prepared in advance in a cache.After the terrorist attack, the alleged perpetrators intended to cross the border and had relevant contacts on the Ukrainian side.The Alleged Perpetrators of the AttackAll four suspects apprehended are citizens of Tajikistan, reportedly registered in the Yaroslavl, Ivanovo and Samara regions. None of them have a Russian passport.Three of the four detainees do not speak Russian fluently. The fourth, not at all; he had to be interrogated through an interpreter.The suspects lived together in a hostel in the north of Moscow for close to a month before the terrorist attack.The handler, who referred to himself as a ""preacher's assistant"", asked Shamsutdin to ""kill people, no matter who.""Shamsutdin was promised ""somewhere in the region of a million"" for the killings of which half was transferred to his card.At the time of writing, it is not known if Shamsutdin's statements have been corroborated.US Withheld Specific Intelligence in TipoffOn March 7, the US had issued an advisory to its citizens not to travel to Russia and cautioned US citizens already in Russia not to participate in large gatherings, specifically mentioning concerts.The fact that the terrorists were still able to enter the concert hall easily and then escape could suggest serious lapses on the part of Russian security services.However, Russian officials have complained that US intelligence lacked specific detail.It is likely that the intel available with the US government was not adequately shared with the Russian government, in order to not reveal the source of the intel. But then, without some specifics, Russian security services could not have acted on the intelligence tip off.Also, the intel was issued 2 weeks ago, before the Presidential elections in Russia. Following the elections, Russian security forces may have lowered their guard, believing that the imperative for a sensational terrorist strike had considerably dissipated.The US has routinely discouraged its citizens from travelling to Russia for several years. So the additional cautionary issued to its citizens on March 7, as it is would not have alarmed Russian authorities.The MastermindsFollowing the attack on Friday, the Islamic State (IS)* group claimed responsibility for the attack. On Saturday, it released a photograph of what it said were the four attackers.The New York Times quotes Colin Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst based in New York, as saying, ""ISIS-K accuses the Kremlin of having Muslim blood in its hands, referencing Moscow's interventions in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Syria.""Russian authorities have not commented on the claim.The Tajikistan suspects who committed the heinous crime were likely hired guns motivated by money and indoctrination, and perhaps fueled by drugs.Investigation has revealed that the alleged perpetrators were headed towards Ukraine to avail of a ""window"" across the border.Ukrainian Connection?Following the arrest of the terrorists in Bryansk, on their way to the Ukrainian border, advisor to the head of Vladimir Zelensky's office, Mikhail Podolyak posted on X, ""Ukraine has nothing to do with the incident.""Intriguingly, US officials started giving a clean chit to Ukraine over any links to the Crocus City Hall terror attack almost immediately after the event, before Russian security forces had determined the sequence of events.The official representative of the White House National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, on March 24 repeated that Ukraine was not involved in the terrorist attack in Krasnogorsk.""ISIS bears full responsibility for this attack. There was no involvement of Ukraine,"" Watstone said in a statement obtained by RIA Novosti.ConclusionThe ISIS-K's, self claimed and US promoted, link to the Crocus City Hall terror attack has found little traction among analysts.The timing of the attack suggests that it was linked to Russia's war with NATO over Ukraine, not Russia's past interventions in muslim countries.The fact that the gunmen were unmasked may have been a ploy to lend credibility to the ISIS-K involvement claim.Admittedly, as yet, there is no clinching evidence that the terror strike was sponsored by an adversary state.It's likely that the US issued an advisory to its citizens on March 7 based on intelligence gathered through its sources in Ukraine, not its sources in Russia or elsewhere.Eventually, Russia will find out the masterminds behind the terrorist attack and as promised by President Putin - Terrorists will face retribution and oblivion.If Ukraine is involved, Russia could well use the Israeli template for exercising its right to self defence, destroying the nation, not just the leadership of the nation. The West, which wholeheartedly supports the Israeli template, would have no reason to complain.However, an Israel-like Russian response can be ruled out because Russia remains a civilised great power.*ISIS (ISIL/Daesh/Islamic State/IS), a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries",sputniknews.in,news,Sputnik India,Vijainder K Thakur,-0.6627450980392157,448963647,1,https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/images/sharing/article/eng/6930533.jpg?69226541711263468,zho-1584274

Fickle weather in March fails to offer necessary conditions for spring flowers to bloomBy Lee Hae-rin

Local governments, renowned for hosting iconic flower festivals every spring, find themselves grappling with flowerless venues this year.

The delayed blooming of seasonal flowers, primarily attributed to climate change, has resulted in a significant setback, leaving these venues bereft of their usual vibrant displays.

The Jinhae Gunhangje Festival, Korea's largest cherry blossom festival that is held in the southern port city of Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, kicked off on Saturday. However, as of Sunday, the city's flowering rate stood at only 15 percent, with the full bloom phase anticipated to occur later next week, according to the city government.

Another major cherry blossom fair, Jeju Cherry Blossom Festival on the southern resort island, which usually celebrates the country's earliest blooming of spring flowers, faced a similar situation this year as the event kicked off on Friday without full blossoms.

The Korea Meteorological Administration's (KMA) Jeju branch said the flowers bloomed on Saturday, a day later than last year. The weather agency expects the blossom to reach its peak on the island around the end of March.

The southern port city of Ulsan also started its cherry blossom without flowers, Saturday. Despite warm weather of around 23 degrees Celsius, cherry blossoms are still budding there. In the worst-case scenario, the flowers will blossom only around next weekend, close to when the event ends.

A popular cherry blossom street in Seoul's Yeouido plans to welcome visitors from this Friday until April 2, but the flowers are expected to blossom only around April 3, according to officials from Yeongdeungpo District.

Cherry blossom flowers are greeted with much excitement here and create ripple effects of some 300 percent surges in sales at sightseeing tourism districts, according to a report by KB Kookmin Card.

This year, many local governments moved up the dates for the festivals in response to last year's abnormally early blooming caused by warming temperatures.

Even a month ago, many anticipated the flowers to bloom earlier than usual, again, as abnormally high temperatures were recorded last winter. The country's average temperature last month was 4.1 degrees Celsius, registered as the highest in February since 1973.

But the weather changed suddenly in March, with abnormal subzero temperatures and lower precipitation levels, failing to offer the necessary and sufficient conditions for the spring flowers to bloom.

During the opening ceremony for the event in Jeju, Jeju City Mayor Kang Byung-sam said, ""Due to the last cold snap and shortage of sunlight, cherry blossoms failed to fully blossom,"" encouraging visitors to enjoy other cultural events featured in the festival, including live band performances, a singing contest, and magic shows instead.

In response to climate change, Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province, rescheduled its flower festival a week later than originally planned to sync with the belated blooming. The event will take place between April 6 and 7, instead of March 30 and 31.

""Around this time of the year, every year, Cheonan boasts a breathtaking cherry blossom spectacle stretching 15 kilometers. However, due to abnormal temperature, the city failed to predict the timing of flower blooming,"" the organizers said.

The World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Climate 2023 report released on March 19 confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature at 1.45 Celsius degree above the pre-industrial revolution baseline.

Talanoa Consulting director and principal consultant Marita Manley said the awards would be designed collaboratively over the next few months.

She said when thinking about sustainability, there was recognition that this subject was multifaceted.

Noting the multiple challenges faced by many in society, Ms Manley said businesses had a huge role to play in addressing those issues.

""Regardless of what you're doing, you have a role to play in addressing some of our society's most fundamental issues, even if it's very minor, even if it is making sure that we are properly managing our wastes.

""The last week has once again shown how disastrous climate risks can be both for our households, our families, as well as our business operations.

So we know that it is incumbent on all of us to be taking these risks more seriously.

""And one of the things that we really want to do is to acknowledge the work that has been done in this space, acknowledge the champions amongst all of you, who are leading the way because businesses are a massive massive part of the solution.""

Ms Manley said the words that were garnered from participants during an exercise on sustainability would be used to form the design of the Green Star Awards.

This setback has sparked concern within the crypto community, prompting discussions about transparency and resilience in the face of technical disruptions.

The platform, boasting two million followers, took to social media to reassure its users that efforts are underway to rectify the situation promptly. It clarified that the ongoing downtime specifically affects its zkEVM and does not extend to any other chains deployed using the chain development kit (CDK).

The issue originates from the blockchain sequencer, responsible for organizing and aggregating transactions into batches before forwarding them to the zkEVM smart contract on Ethereum's main network.

This unexpected downtime has not only disrupted its operations but has also stirred unease within the broader cryptocurrency community. Users and stakeholders, accustomed to the platform's reliability, are now expressing concerns about the implications of such technical glitches' reputation and the broader ecosystem's stability.

Despite the disruption, Polygon is actively engaged in resolving the matter and has pledged to provide a comprehensive ""post-mortem"" statement once the issue is resolved. The platform's assurance underscores its commitment to transparency and accountability in addressing technical challenges promptly.

As Polygon addresses the technical hiccup, community members within the crypto sphere are voicing growing concerns regarding the extended period of downtime. Across various platforms, including X, users have expressed confusion and frustration at the lack of communication surrounding the issue.

With questions and speculations circulating about the zkEVM's 10-hour downtime, there's a clear indication of the community's desire for transparency and clarity from Polygon.

This incident isn't isolated; it mirrors a similar disruption experienced by the Solana network, shedding light on the intricate challenges inherent in blockchain infrastructure. Polygon's zkEVM, introduced in March 2023, was designed to revolutionize smart contract deployment by offering increased finality and reduced costs.

Through the innovative approach of transaction batching, the open-source zkEVM aimed to propel decentralized application (DApp) scalability to new heights, promising enhanced performance and efficiency.

In the ever-evolving realm of blockchain technology, occasional disruptions such as the zkEVM downtime experienced by Polygon serve as poignant reminders of the sector's continuous evolution. These incidents underscore the critical need for resilient infrastructure and agile response mechanisms to navigate the complexities inherent in blockchain systems.

As Polygon diligently addresses the technical challenges surrounding the zkEVM downtime, the incident highlights the paramount importance of transparency, communication, and proactive measures.

Transparency ensures that users remain informed about the status of operations, fostering trust and confidence within the crypto community. Effective communication channels enable platforms like Polygon to provide timely updates and reassure users amidst disruptions, mitigating uncertainty and minimizing potential impact.

The proactive approach taken by Polygon in resolving the zkEVM downtime exemplifies the agility required to maintain operational resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges. By swiftly addressing issues and implementing corrective measures, blockchain platforms can uphold their commitments to reliability and performance, bolstering user trust and satisfaction.

The zkEVM downtime incident underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the imperative for continuous adaptation and improvement. By embracing transparency, communication, and proactive measures, platforms like Polygon pave the way for a more robust and resilient blockchain ecosystem, poised to meet the evolving needs of users and stakeholders alike.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1607843137254903,448963566,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9421060

Now, as resources like federal tax credits, state-funded rebates, and the growth of local professional services are invested in energy efficient home designs and solutions, more people than ever are doing what they can to build a sustainable environment inside and outside their homes.

""These are all good trends,"" said Heather Chandler, owner/founder of the SunriseGuide, which publishes Green & Healthy Maine HOMES magazine. ""We are reducing our carbon emissions, Mainers are saving money on heating costs and we are all benefitting from cleaner air.""

To meet this growing consumer interest, Chandler and the Green & Healthy Maine team are producing the Green Home + Energy Show on Saturday, April 6 in South Portland. This one-day expo will feature industry leaders

in the worlds of solar power, heat pumps, air quality, green building and design, electric vehicles, sustainable home products and more.

""If you have questions about any aspect of your home and future improvements, this is the place to be,"" said Chandler. ""Whether you are looking to build new or upgrade an existing property, you won't find a better collection of Maine businesses that specialize in healthy, efficient and high-performing homes.""

For people looking for resources and inspiration, here are the top energy efficiency trends in our state.

MORE HEAT PUMPS

Maine residents have fully embraced heat pumps. In fact, the state met an installation goal set by the Governor's Office two years early and installed 100,000 new heat pumps as of September 2023. Now the goal is to get another 175,000 installed by 2027. This goal includes pumps used for supplemental heating, but a growing number of single-family homes in Maine are heated solely with heat pumps, which saves the homeowner money and reduces emissions. According to Efficiency Maine, homes heated with ductless heat pumps have an average annual cost of $1,698 compared to $3,373 for homes heated by an oil boiler and $3,751 with an oil furnace.

Julia Bassett Schwerin, a green realtor with Advisors Living Real Estate, found that of all new construction properties from 2023 that were listed publicly for sale, 23% showed heat pumps as the sole heat source. These homes didn't spend more time on the market and had the same list-to-sold price ratio compared to homes heated with fossil fuels.

MORE SOLAR AND WIND

We're also seeing skyrocketing growth in homes powered by solar electricity. According to data from the Governor's Energy Office, the solar produced statewide in 2015 was enough to power 2,100 homes. Last year, the amount of solar produced was enough to power 130,000 homes. Meanwhile, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, wind power provided 23% of the state's net renewable energy generation in 2022.

Between electric and solar, this means fewer and fewer Maine homes are heated with fuel oil, which is important because Maine has the highest rate of heating oil use in the country. As of December of 2023, 56% of all homes in the state used it as a primary heating source (compared to 4% nationwide). This is down from nearly 65% in 2015.

MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

Electric vehicle use has also seen enormous growth in the last eight years. In 2015, there were 802 registered electric vehicles in the state. At the beginning of this year, there were 13,364, which has also led to increased home charger installations that add longer term value to homes. For those concerned with powering up on a road trip, Maine will be installing nearly 600 high-powered charging stations across the state in the coming years, using a federal grant of $15 million.

The earth's climate is at an inflection point and the stakes for the future are high. With federal tax credits for investments in home energy efficiency on the table through 2033, and the ongoing availability of state-level rebates, ""going green"" is a powerful home-building trend that will soon become the standard we expect and from which we will all benefit.

The World Health Organization estimates that 3.6 billion people in the world already live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change. As many as one million plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, and entire ecosystems are unstable. Mainers along the coast experienced the reality of climate vulnerability in January.

Why are candidates avoiding this issue? Follow the money. Candidates do not wish to risk losing campaign contributions by pointing out that many corporations have put profits ahead of the well-being of the Earth.

Historically, heavy carbon emitters have diverted attention from their practices by focusing on how private citizens can make carbon-saving changes. In her excellent book, ""American Breakdown,"" Jennifer Lunden writes, ""...while one individual can save 2.4 tons of carbon dioxide per year by going carless, in 2020 Shell alone emitted the equivalent of 1.38 billion tons of carbon dioxide.""

Major polluters need to be held accountable, and this issue belongs in local, state and national contests. The land we farm, the waters that sustain us and the air we breathe need to outweigh campaign dollars. We need to speak up and hold candidates accountable for where they stand.

Affectionately called the ""Green Tunnel"" for its dense, leafy green forest canopy in spring, summer and early fall, countless hikers from far and wide flock to the trail for recreational enjoyment. Many visit for a few hours, others for several days and even weeks, while some trek the entire 2,198-mile distance between Georgia and Maine over many months.

Mills Kelly is a professor of history and former executive director of the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Kelly is an enthusiastic hiker with a particular affinity for the Appalachian Trail and its rich history, a topic he has researched and written about since 2016. In 2019, Kelly's investigative work led to developing ""The Green Tunnel"" podcast, now one of the most popular digital audio programs in the U.S.

Hosted by Kelly, ""The Green Tunnel"" delves into the history and culture of the celebrated Appalachian Trail, which has been an important part of the American fabric since it was proposed by forester, planner and conservationist Benton MacKaye in his 1921 article, ""The Appalachian Trail: An Experiment in Regional Planning."" Incredibly, the Appalachian Trail was completed just 16 years later, the final 2 miles being cut near Maine's Sugarloaf Mountain.

""We're so proud of the work we're doing. We're appreciative of our audience and happy that people are enjoying the show,"" said Kelly. ""Podcasts like 'The Green Tunnel' allow historians like me an important opportunity to speak to the public in a very personal way. We're able to convey historical knowledge in an accessible manner.""

MacKaye's original concept for the Appalachian Trail was about getting city people out into the woods to breathe the fresh air and reap the benefits of quality time spent recreating in the mountains. ""The trail's appeal, its magnetism, is still rooted in this ideal that people want more nature, more wild in their lives, especially as the world becomes more technological,"" noted Kelly. It's little wonder then that 'The Green Tunnel' podcast has become so popular.

Now in its third season, there are more than 40 episodes of The Green Tunnel available for download from Apple Podcasts, Spotify and a variety of other such apps. You can also find it online at r2studios.org. The first season explores the 100-year history of the trail, while the second season takes a look at the many faces and facets of the people associated with the trail. The current season focuses on the trail's natural history.

The range of trail topics is remarkable. You'll learn about shelters and hostels as community gathering places, hiker trash (the problem of the real stuff, not the smelly individuals), hiker food (macaroni and cheese to freeze-dried meals), the many dangers (bears, snakes, lightning, ticks), pooping on the trail (""Crappalachian Trail"" is the episode name. How fun is that?), and, of course, the perennial favorite: gear.

There's the heart wrenching story of the people uprooted from their homes during the creation of Shenandoah National Park, how women helped shape the trail, the Indigenous peoples and their lands the trail traverses, hiker motivations, the increasing diversity of trail users, the comeback of the American chestnut tree, the role of the Civilian Conservation Corps in early trail building efforts, and the geology of the Appalachian Mountains.

In addition to the full-length episodes (generally 25-40 minutes), there are ""shorts"" of anywhere from 8-15 minutes that take you to iconic locations up and down the AT, places like Charlie's Bunion in the Smokies, McAfee Knob in Virginia, Mount Greylock in Massachusetts, and the trail towns of Damascus, Virginia, and Monson, Maine.

The episodes are narrative style (""we're telling a story,"" Kelly said), and each is a collaborative effort of faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, who do the research, writing and editing. Mills does the interviews, which are spliced into the narrative. There's more editing, and then it's put into audio. Interestingly, for every minute of podcast, there's roughly an hour of production time. The quality is evident.

From ardent hikers to armchair adventurers, if you're a fan of the Appalachian Trail, it's a good bet you're going to love listening to ""The Green Tunnel"" podcast. You might also want to check out Kelly's fascinating new book, ""Virginia's Lost Appalachian Trail.""

Investigation shows environmental gaps from Quebec to the Amazon | CBC News,"At times, Rio Tinto has spilled dangerous chemicals at several of its Quebec sites without disclosing it to the provincial government -- behaviour that contradicts the multinational's brand as an eco-friendly business.

Documents obtained by Radio-Canada's Enquête program through an access-to-information request reveal more than 100 environmental infractions doled out to Rio Tinto's aluminum division in Quebec over the past 15 years.

The company has also paid $2.1 million in fines in that same period, making it the third biggest environmental offender in the province.

The company was fingered eight times for either neglecting or waiting to report problems related to pollution to Quebec's Environment Ministry. The documents include infractions for obstructing the work of public officials and failing to provide mandatory documents when required.

These infractions took place at Rio Tinto's massive Complexe Jonquière, and other nearby sites located around the city of Saguenay. The Complexe Jonquière is an industrial site that employs 1,500 people. It includes two aluminum plants, and various other refining, chemical and research facilities.

Rio Tinto's environmental missteps have come just as the company amasses tens of millions of dollars in public money.

Enquête also corroborated the company's spotty environmental record through a whistleblower who works at the Jonquière complex and whose identity it agreed to protect due to fear of professional reprisals.

In addition to looking into Rio Tinto's environmental practices in Quebec, Enquête also travelled to the heart of the Amazon forest in Brazil -- to a mine in which Rio Tinto has a 22 percent stake. It is where the company sources some of its bauxite.

There, local residents expressed their concerns about the mine's effects on the environment and the long-term health of people who live near it.

According to the whistleblower, the company has often resorted to hiding spills and altering a substance's colour by using gravel or dirt.

""We hide things all the time, and sweep them under the rug. It will take time to see all the things that are hidden, but it's starting to come out,"" says the source.

""Only the severity of the fine can make the company react.""

Rio Tinto declined our interview requests. In an email, it denied these allegations.

Rio Tinto Aluminium said ""it operates with a strict culture of environmental compliance which includes reporting spills to the competent authorities.""

""If an incident occurs, it is thoroughly investigated and corrective measures are put in place to prevent it from recurring,"" the company said.

In a letter made public on Friday, Rio Tinto says allegations of cover-ups, obstruction or delays are ""not our values and this is not how we behave.""

""Our 4,300 employees in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, like those around the world, are concerned about the legacy they will leave to their children,"" the letter states.

The industry has for years emphasized its green bonafides by claiming it uses clean hydroelectricity. Quebec aluminum plants emit less carbon dioxide than plants in China and elsewhere that are powered using coal.

But critics say plans that could have further reduced Rio Tinto's carbon emissions sooner were either never implemented or only materialized much later than promised.

""Investments [were promised] to modernize all the plants, which were outdated, aging, polluting and at the end of their useful lives,"" says Jacques Dubuc, who is now retired and used to work as a spokesperson for Alcan, which was bought by Rio Tinto in 2007.

He said ""we have a history of broken promises, partially kept promises, with excuses or tricks to try to prolong the life"" of aging plants.

In 2007, with talks brewing about the implementation of a cap-and-trade system in Quebec for carbon pollution, ""green aluminum"" started to become a common industry term. Aluminum producers that were among the province's biggest polluters were expected to have to start paying into the scheme which would have had an impact on profits.

But by playing up the concept of green aluminum behind the scenes, those companies were able to get exemptions, according to Marie-Claude Prémont, a professor at the École nationale d'administration publique.

""Green aluminum is a marketing tool,"" she said.

""It's a label that was assigned to an industry that barely changed in the last few decades.""

According to Prémont, ""the public needs more than just marketing"" to understand what is going on and to make informed decisions.

Rio Tinto, with its four aluminum smelters and its alumina refinery, still ranks among the province's 20 biggest polluters, and since 2007 its CO2 emissions have hardly budged.

In 2018, Elysis, a joint venture that includes Rio Tinto and Alcoa, was established as a research initiative meant to create aluminum with a zero carbon footprint. Since then, the Quebec and Canadian governments have doled out $160 million in subsidies.

On its website, Elysis claims it is developing a ""revolutionary"" and ""disruptive"" technology, even calling it ""non-polluting"" aluminum. But the technology that was supposed to come into large-scale production in the mid-2020s has quietly been pushed back to beyond 2030.

In an email, Elysis did not divulge its new timetable, saying it was concentrating on research and development.

Even if Elysis was fully implemented, between 1.3 and 2 tonnes of CO2 are generated per tonne of aluminum. That's because bauxite has to be extracted, shipped and refined to alumina before it is made into aluminum -- and each part of that process has a carbon footprint.

The wide margin of CO2 produced depends on whether the alumina is refined in Quebec or imported.

Rio Tinto will testify before a Parliamentary committee in Ottawa in April to provide an update on its program. It also says that a commercial prototype will come out later this year.

The company also says it is working systematically to further reduce emissions at each production stage.

The aluminum industry is expected to grow worldwide by almost 40 percent by 2030 due largely to increased demand from electric car manufacturers.

Much of the bauxite used by Rio Tinto comes from a mine in the heart of the Amazon forest.

""To claim that your product is green is very serious, given the bauxite production chain. How can you call clearing the forest green? How can anyone say that digging up the soil is green?,"" asks Lilian Braga, a public prosecutor who works in the Amazonian state of Para near the mine run by Mineracao Rio Do Norte (MRN).

That ore deposit was discovered by Montreal-based Alcan in the 1960s. The mine has been shipping industrial quantities of bauxite to Quebec since 1979.

Because of the mine, ""people sometimes get sick,"" according to local activist Carlos Printes whose family has lived near the MRN owned mining town of Porto Trombetas for many years.

""Many people fall ill because of the company. But they do nothing for these people,"" he said.

Although there are no long-term public health studies that confirm this, other people living near the mine repeated these claims.

""People who drink this water get diarrhea and stomach aches. We can see that this is a water-related problem because not everyone has a well,"" says Raymundo Wilson, a village head who lives near Lake Batata.

MRN dumped 18 million cubic metres of bauxite residue into the lake from 1979 to 1989 in what some consider to be one of the most glaring cases of industrial pollution in the Amazon at the time. He told us that 60 out of 120 families living around the lake still don't have access to filtered well water.

Heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury can be released after bauxite is extracted from the ground. These can also get into water sources. Locals also worry about how safe the tailings dams are. These are similar to wet landfills and MRN has 29 of them where it put the tailings produced after bauxite was washed.

MRN's director of sustainability Vladimir Moreira told Enquête that mine tailings are inert and that there is no danger to human health. Asked if he would eat local fish, he replied: ""Of course I would.""

The company says it has ""around 250 monitoring stations for water, air and noise quality. And all these stations show that there is no contamination.""

""Our waste management system is absolutely safe,"" Moreira said. He added that the mine follows international standards and local communities participate in mine safety protocols.

In its open letter, Rio Tinto says it also works with MRN to ensure best practices are followed to improve environmental and social performance. These include robust reforestation efforts, and closely monitoring water quality and dam stability as well as health and education services to local communities.

Brazil has had a history of tailing dams ruptures with Mariana in 2015 and Brumadinho in 2019 which killed 19 and 272 people respectively. The latter had a type of dam construction known as upstream.

Vale, the company that owned the Brumadinho mine and was a 40 percent shareholder of MRN until 2023 said in a 2020 statement to the Security and Exchange Commission that MRN had dams similar to those at Brumadinho.

Tthe rupture of any of these structures could cause loss of lives and serious personal, property and environmental damages,"" Vale said in its statement.

Jose Domingos, a farmer who lives near Lake Sapucua, which is downstream of the dams, says the threat of an environmental disaster constantly hangs over local communities.

""If one day, there is a possible problem for the 16 communities of Lake Sapucua, it's over for us, you understand?"" Domingos said. ""We can't sleep at night during the winter, because it rains so much.""

MRN commissioned studies that allowed it to get its dam classifications changed with the Brazilian government's mining oversight body. Dams that were classified as upstream, a category widely considered more dangerous, were given a different designation.

Moreira says that the geography where MRN has its tailings reservoirs is different from what existed in Mariana and Bruhmadino.

But at least one expert questions those reclassifications.

If there's any doubt a dam, a preventative approach should be used to ""ensure the protection of people and the environment,"" said Andressa Lanchotti, who sat on the prosecution team in the Bruhmadino case.

Rio Tinto says it is aware of the concerns associated with bauxite mining in Brazil.

""We are working tirelessly to improve our operations by promoting a circular economy and furthering the environmental, social and governance best practices throughout our entire supply chain, from mine to consumer,"" said Nina Mankovitz, vice-president at Rio Tinto Aluminium.

""To call it green aluminum is greenwashing,"" said Martine Ouellet, a former Quebec minister of natural resources who now heads a small political party dedicated to fighting climate change.

Ouellet, who was also head of special projects at Hydro-Québec, estimates that with greenhouse gas fee exemptions, tax rebates and through use of their privately-owned dams, Rio Tinto gets about 1.2 billion dollars a year in subsidies .

Rio Tinto says that most of the projects it initiated since 2020, totalling $2 billion in investments, did not get government subsidies.

Elysis has gotten buy-in from major brands like Apple, Michelob and BMW, who plan to purchase this product once it is available.

But the aluminum industry is asking for even more funding.

In early March 2024, the Aluminium Association of Canada asked the Quebec government to continue subsidizing electricity for aluminum and for more investments in Elysis. These subsidies and financial benefits could cost taxpayers further billions over the coming years.",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,-0.2,448963487,18,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7153499.1711227564!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rio-tinto.jpg,

The Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI) has issued a plea to the government, urging against the imposition of export duties on low-grade iron ore. According to FIMI, such a measure would not only result in substantial revenue losses for the state but also adversely impact employment and foreign exchange earnings.

Highlighting the significant contribution of the mining sector to India's GDP, particularly iron ore among non-coal minerals, FIMI stressed on its role in job creation, employing approximately 5 lakh individuals, both directly and indirectly.

FIMI's representation to the government highlighted the adverse effects of the export duty imposed on low-grade iron ore fines and pellets in May 2022, which was later rescinded in November of the same year. The body underscored that any proposal to ban or restrict exports of iron ore and pellets would be detrimental to the industry.

More than 90 per cent of India's iron ore exports are directed to China, making it a critical market for the sector. FIMI stressed on the importance of maintaining the current status quo of zero export duty on these products to sustain industry growth.

Additionally, FIMI warned of potential production setbacks if export bans or duties were implemented, projecting a drop in production from 330 million tonnes to 225 million tonnes in FY'25.

The representation also highlighted the challenge of managing iron ore fines, which constitute a significant portion of mined ore. These fines, particularly those below 58 per cent Fe, pose logistical and environmental challenges, limiting their utility in the steel industry and hindering scientific mining practices.

KPEEL was started to reduce regional disparities in learning outcomes, improve the retention of girls in upper primary education, and strengthen systems at the national level to ensure learning for all.

The technical team led by senior officials from the Directorate of Projects Coordination and Delivery in the Ministry of Education are on a ten-day field visit to review the status of the four-year Program launched in 2022.

KPEEL Project National Coordinator Martha Ekirapa said the exercise which was under the fourth implementation support mission is expected to cover at least 13 counties between March 20 and 29.

She said the technical teams comprising officials from multinational organisations including the World Bank, UNHCR, and other stakeholders under the KPEEL are expected to submit their findings for discussions at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development at the end of the mission.

World Bank senior education specialist and team leader KPEEL Ruth Charo and the Director in charge of Directorate of Projects coordination and delivery Elijah Mungai last Thursday jetted into Lodwar town to kick off the countrywide exercise in Turkana County.

The team visited schools in the Kakuma refugee camps where the Department of Refugees services in collaboration with the UNHCR, Jesuit Refugee Services, and other partners put up new schools for the assimilated refugee community who were permanently resettled in the country.

Some of the counties enlisted for the review included Turkana, Samburu, Bungoma, Siaya, Kisii, Bomet, Narok, Kisumu, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru Mombasa and Kwale where the teams will assess sample schools and collate the impact of the KPEEL program on the learning environment.

A notable outcome realised during the mission was the positive impact the school feeding and scholarship component of the program had on learners within refugee communities at the UNHCR Kakuma Refugee camps.

This is after it emerged that the initiative had drastically improved the previously worrying retention and transition rates of girls.

The four-year multibillion project IDA credit of USD 160 Million and a USD 40 million grant from the refugee window was rolled out in 2022 for a four-year implementation in which the government was to contribute Sh1 billion to the kitty.

He, however, cautioned school administrators that the disbursement of the Sh480,000 grants under the 22022-2026 KPEEL Program will be pegged on the Performance for Results indicators whereby subsequent continuity in funding will be subject to the achievement of specific results, as measured by the seven Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs).

The program running concurrently with the government's NESSP II initiative was tailored to thaw out inequities in access to quality basic education with a deliberate focus on the girl child including those within and around the refugee camps.

The Program which intends to reduce disparities in learning outcomes, improve the retention of girls in upper primary education, and strengthen systems for equitable education outcomes is set to benefit at least six million learners in primary schools including about 221,529 children in refugee hosting counties.

However, the program encompasses components of infrastructure development, school meals, environment, governance and accountability to ensure that desired results areas including improved learning outcomes were realised.",the-star.co.ke,news,The Star,,0.1843137254901961,448963480,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cPC1mfTyLE_yemAIzhLSZaN2FSTn8cq8r67Zmd2nCEdY0Vg5HjFdm-4osbGKuXaIXF_fH9rOuCjlwxJpXhKcb5YBJ9STpqwJzlG0pDYt=s1000,

CREDIT: ANDREW BONE

On the 19th October 2023, a group of Just Stop Oil activists blocked a bus transporting asylum seekers to the Bibby Stockholm, a three-storey barge moored off the Isle of Portland in Dorset on which the Home Office plans to house hundreds of asylum seekers as they wait for their claims to be processed. In a repeat of incidents seen across the country, the bus drove into the protesters, forcing them to move.

Later, in Portland, the people on the bus were greeted by a small group of locals welcoming them to the town while at the same time protesting about their predicament. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson framed the action as a manifestation of the struggle for climate justice: 'There is no climate justice without justice for all people... When we take action against the Bibby Stockholm, we're taking action to defend people's right to move safely with dignity'.

As Andreas Malm and the Zetkin Collective research group into the far right have observed, there is a tendency to view the climate crisis as a rallying moment for the world, as it faces a threat to the survival of humanity as a species. However, this is a false hope. The far right is almost universally opposed to action on climate change; indeed, it is squarely lined up behind the fossil fuel industry. In any case, there are still trillions of dollars of oil reserves left in the world to be extracted, and fossil capital will seek to further existing political alliances with the right in order to maximise profits.

The incident that took place on the road to Portland is indicative of a broader trend of convergence that brings together the far right (manifest in its governmental, movement and terrorist forms) and the climate crisis. Intersections between these two points of seemingly separate politics are likely to increase in frequency and intensity as the crisis develops.

The escalation, diversification and broadening of the climate crisis is particularly concerning as fascism, in both its historical and contemporary forms, feeds off popular anxieties produced by crises. At the same time, it aligns itself with particular sections of capital to further its project. We can therefore expect to see the far right align itself with sections that will exacerbate the climate crisis, while also using the consequences of the crisis to stoke nationalist sentiments and further intensify border regimes.

Outright denial of a change in the climate has become rarer on the far right. However, other forms of denial, such as impact denialism, which denies the seriousness of the effects of the crisis, and, even more insidious, urgency denial, arguing that action is only needed some time in the future, have continued to carve out space for fossil fuel extraction.

In Germany, the far right Alternative für Deutschland is implacably opposed to climate action, calling in 2020 for an 'exit plan from Germany's coal exit' and withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, following the lead of the Donald Trump administration. On a governmental level, the climate struggle will necessarily involve a transnational struggle against the far right.

The climate crisis also presents opportunities for the far right to further its political agenda. As the crisis entrenches, some parts of the world will become increasingly inhospitable to human life, forcing people to move in large numbers. Here, climate struggles will increasingly intersect with the fight for a just transition for all - and against militarised borders, authoritarianism and an entrenchment of existing global systems of racial domination.

In its movement form, the far right has intermeshed with national border policing, including in recent times the Defend Europa boat that was positioned for a summer in the Mediterranean. A real danger may arise in not only how the far right uses increased climate-induced migration as fuel for its politics but also in more explicit alliances with neoliberal border regimes.

There are other scenarios, however, where fascism and environmentalism can come together to construct a more explicit eco-fascist politics, in contrast to climate denialism. The far right can hold contradictory positions on the climate crisis not only because of fascism's inherent irrationality, but also because it is diverse in its ideology and practices.

Climate struggles will increasingly intersect with the fight for a just transition for all

In the manifesto of the Christchurch mosque shooter, who slaughtered 51 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand in 2019 and described himself as an eco-fascist, a Malthusian solution to the climate crisis comes through the mass murder of non-whites, who he claimed were having too many children for the planet to sustain.

Such a position is not yet widely argued on the movement or governmental far right, but its influence is present in the hostility to non-white life that pervades far-right politics. As the crisis escalates, ideas based on far-right ecologism and the solving of the climate crisis through racial violence could come to the fore.

How should we, as anti-fascists, climate activists and leftists, respond? As we see increasing convergences between far-right politics and the climate crisis, so too must we begin to bring together anti-fascism with movements for climate justice. This does not only mean defending climate movements from threats from the far right but recognising that any just climate transition will not be consensus based but will involve protracted struggle between broadly defined reactionary forces and those that would oppose them.

Lastly, the left more broadly must learn to adapt to the dizzying array of disasters and protracted crises that will come to the fore in the years to come. Only through organising against a far right willing to push the environment to the brink can we realise justice and, ultimately, a better world.",redpepper.org.uk,news,Red Pepper,Gerry Hart,0.0980392156862746,448963453,1,https://www.redpepper.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bibby-stockholdm.jpg,

But along with this change of seasons also comes a change in the clocks, with the hand on your watch set to move forward by one hour at the end of next weekend, meaning the sun will not set until after 8pm on Sunday week.

While many will welcome this, the change can have an impact on people's sleep-syncing routines and overall sleep quality as the change shifts an hour of daylight in the morning to the evening.

Rhysa Phommachanh, Health and Personal Care Specialist at Landys Chemist, said: ""The transition to Daylight Saving Time (DST), when clocks go forward by one hour in the spring, can significantly impact people's sleep syncing routines and overall sleep quality.

""This change effectively shifts an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening, which can disrupt the body's internal clock or circadian rhythm.

""The sudden change means that the external cues your body uses to regulate sleep, such as natural light and darkness, are now an hour off from what your body expects.

""This mismatch can disrupt sleep cycles, making it harder to fall asleep at your usual time and even harder to wake up feeling refreshed.""

To help minimise the impact on your health and body when the clocks go forward, Rhysa outlines four simple steps to avoid feeling groggy when the clocks change:

Gradually wake up earlier

In the days leading up to the change, you can prepare by gradually shifting your bedtime and wake-up times closer to the new schedule in 15 to 20-minute increments. This gradual shift can help ease the transition for your body's internal clock.

Increase exposure to natural light

Alternatively, you can expose yourself to natural light in the morning to help adjust your circadian rhythm to the new time. Going to sleep with your blinds or curtains ajar can help you achieve this.

Reduce exposure to artificial light

In the evening, reduce exposure to artificial light, especially from screens, to encourage your body's natural production of melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleepiness.

Avoid caffeine in the evenings

Another helpful tip is to avoid caffeine and other stimulants late in the day, as they can further disrupt your ability to fall asleep at the new time.

Brad Wall says yes - National | Globalnews.ca,"Is it time for a ""middle ground"" on carbon reduction as the looming increase to the federal carbon price continues to stir growing concerns among both progressive and conservative political leaders?

Former Saskatchewan conservative premier Brad Wall says yes, and that any potential changes to how Canada tries to reduce carbon will need to weigh both what's affordable for families and what technology can be used.

""If there's a change at the federal level, a new government is going to have to look at the financial state of things. Look at the books, so to speak, of the country and determine what is affordable,"" said Wall, who is a longtime opponent of the federal carbon price.

""I do think there's a middle ground somewhere between a carbon tax that's really not good for the economy and not very good for families in an inflationary environment, and an approach to technology that might take a price signal, but also has some market elements of it and some provincial-federal investment.""

As an alternative, Wall pointed to American legislation aimed at addressing climate change, which carries large costs but no economy-wide carbon price. This includes the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes several green measures and is expected to cost the American treasury $780 billion over 10 years.

The political fight over the carbon price has taken centre stage in the House of Commons over the past week -- the last sitting week before the annual increase takes effect on April 1, as Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre frames it as a major driver of cost-of-living challenges.

Since the plan for a federal pollution price was first announced in fall 2016, conservative-leaning politicians have opposed the measure, with the first major challenge starting with Wall.

""Our position was never that Canada shouldn't be doing its share on the climate change front, that provinces shouldn't be doing a share,"" Wall told Global News in an interview from his home in Cypress Hills, Sask.

""We just thought a tax on 1.6 per cent of global emissions was inferior policy to a focus on technological investments that could help solve the problem globally.""

If the Conservatives form government after the next election, Poilievre has pledged to ""axe the tax"" and put an end to the Liberals' signature climate measure.

Poilievre has not released a platform plank on how the party would address climate change but has said he sees the solution through technological measures like carbon capture and nuclear power.

And with Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Fury and Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie also voicing concerns with the carbon price increase this week, the concerns even among Liberals raise questions about what an alternative could look like.

Wall has been a proponent of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as one alternative.

This still comes with a significant public price tag.

The Boundary Dam CCS facility opened in the province in October 2014, making it the first commercial facility of its kind in the world. At opening, it carried a $1.35-billion price tag, with $240 million coming from the federal government and $1.1 billion from the Saskatchewan government.

Since it became operational, the Boundary Dam CCS facility has captured nearly 5.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to Crown electrical utility SaskPower. But the plant has missed key targets and been hit by significant outages, and some environmental advocates have questioned the high costs of the project.

In the 2021 federal election, then-Conservative leader Erin O'Toole campaigned on removing the carbon price with an alternative plan. This would cap the fuel charge at $50 per tonne, as opposed to $170 per tonne in 20230 under the current Liberal policy.

O'Toole maintained this was ""not a tax"" because no money collected would go to the federal government, instead being syphoned to individual ""carbon savings accounts,"" which people could use to make green purchases.

Even for opponents of the Liberals like Wall, the pitch was confusing.

""O'Toole before (Poilievre) was going to replace it with some sort of an air miles-like program. I couldn't even just explain it to people when they asked me during that election campaign,"" he said.

Now, even progressive-leaning provincial politicians are wanting to at least see changes to the Liberal policy.

In addition to Furey, Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie came out Tuesday saying that if elected her government will not use the federal carbon price. She said a policy is still being developed, but the mandate she gave her team is to be different than the federal backstop.

""We said, 'Please evaluate all measures, all opportunities, look broadly, look abroad.' What's being done that we can adopt and emulate that won't cost Ontario families that are already burdened, that can't handle more taxation, but polluters are held accountable,"" Crombie said Tuesday.

After being elected as Manitoba premier, Wab Kinew told The West Block that he wants to revisit the role of the federal carbon price in his province. Kinew cited the fact 95 per cent of Manitoba's electricity comes from hydro power. Manitoba is one of three jurisdictions where the federal backstop applies to both heavy emitters and fuel.

The earliest this can take place is 2027, the next time the federal carbon price is up for its legislated review.

On Tuesday, Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault said the increase cannot be paused because you can't pause climate change.

Wall says he believes there's been a change in attitude on the carbon price recently due in part to inflation putting a greater focus on affordability and credits Poilievre's messaging on the subject.

But Wall attributes an announcement from Trudeau as the main inflection point - when he announced a three-year pause on the charge for home heating oil.

""I think that was an inflection point where Canadians said, 'Wait a minute.' If this is really about climate change and really about the environment, then how can you exclude this sort of very heavy-emitting source of energy and not do the same for others across the country?"" Wall said.

""That seems more political than it does environmental, and I think it really has hurt the federal government on this.""

Most recent public opinion polls give the Conservatives a sizable lead over the Liberals in support.

With the Liberals, NDP and Bloc Québécois voting against Conservative carbon price-related motions over the past week, Wall says it would take a Tory majority to actually ""axe the tax.""

""It's looking good right now, but I remember from my time in politics there's no lead that's safe. And even if there is a lead in the polls, you want to make sure you're working extra hard, like you're 10 points behind,"" Wall said.

When a tree falls in the forest, lianas hear an opportunity. Figuratively, at least. These long-stemmed woody vines hitch a ride to the canopy by climbing up trees, rather than investing in their own structural support, i.e. a trunk. Evolving an impressive arsenal of adaptations, lianas compete aggressively with other plants for nutrients, water and sunlight -- especially near gaps in the canopy. This botanical battle plays out in forests across the world, but it's particularly prevalent in tropical forests, where lianas can comprise up to 25% of woody plant species.

Researchers have known for decades that woody vines are becoming more abundant, with negative impacts on tree growth and carbon sequestration. Now, a new study published in the journal Global Change Biology shows that forest disturbance and climate change are driving lianas' dominance over trees in a way that could intensify harm to forest recovery and carbon drawdown.

""These changes could lead to a shift in the balance of competitive power between lianas and trees, altering forest structure, dynamics, and function, with negative consequences for forest biodiversity and carbon storage,"" says study co-author Alain Ngute from the Forest Research Institute at Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast.

According to a growing body of research, lianas are getting too good at what they do. The new study analyzes data from more than 1,000 previous liana studies conducted all over the world, untangling some interesting trends: forest disturbance and rising heat are powerful predictors of lianas outcompeting trees. When forests lose trees (naturally or due to human activity), it opens up new space in the canopy. Opportunistic woody vines thrive in these disturbed areas, especially at lower elevations. The analysis also confirmed that lianas gain competitive advantages in forests with low precipitation, higher temperatures, and lengthy droughts -- conditions already intensifying due to climate change and expected to worsen as the world continues to heat up.

2023 was the hottest year on record so far, and very likely the warmest year in at least 125,000 years. Climate change, coupled with more resource demands from a growing human population -- including the deforestation and forest degradation associated with agriculture -- are putting enormous pressure on Earth's forests.

""Lianas can seriously depress forest biomass by limiting tree growth and survival,"" says study co-author Bill Laurance of James Cook University in Australia. ""They can shift forests toward hyper-disturbed states with reduced carbon storage, stunted structure, and altered ecological dynamics.""

Previous research shows that lianas can significantly reduce the amount of carbon stored in tropical forests by stifling the ability of trees to sequester CO2. This is especially important to consider for tropical forests, some of the most carbon-rich environments on Earth.

With a better understanding of what gives lianas their competitive edge, forest managers and conservation agencies may be able to implement better restoration strategies for recovering forests. However, this isn't as simple as chopping away at every liana in sight.

According to Robyn Burnham, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan in the U.S., lianas bring a host of benefits to local ecosystems.

""Some whole lineages of lianas (for example, the genus Passifloras) add tasty fruits for animals and have a strong pollination system that provides for insects,"" Burnham, who studies lianas in the Amazon Basin but wasn't involved in the new paper, told Mongabay by email. ""So, they increase biodiversity with very little extra space needed.""

Lianas bring plenty of good things to the table. They boost the biodiversity of insectivorous birds, and provide shelter for plants and animals. They even enhance soil fertility through the shedding and decomposition of their leaves.

""We should not aim to eliminate lianas from forests, but rather to maintain a balance between lianas and trees that allows for both forest recovery and biodiversity conservation,"" Ngute says.

He adds that effective liana management may look like monitoring vine dominance and keeping them below a certain threshold to allow for faster tree regeneration. Forest managers may even include lianas in restorative plantings when certain species boost ecosystem functioning. Forests in regions vulnerable to liana dominance, like the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and the Borneo-Mekong Forest Basin, should also be prioritized by forest managers, Ngute says.

While there's still plenty to learn about how to manage these increasingly abundant crafty vines, this new research can help inform conservationists and policymakers about the best ways to restore and protect the world's forests.

""This work means a lot to me, as it addresses a global challenge that affects millions of people and ecosystems,"" Ngute says. ""I believe that understanding the role lianas play in forest dynamics is crucial for developing effective and sustainable forest restoration strategies.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",britainnews.net,news,Britain News,,0.3098039215686275,448963252,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

These halving events happen roughly every four years, but the exact date can vary slightly due to minor fluctuations in block creation times on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin halvings are incredibly significant because they directly impact the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. When the next halving happens, the reward miners receive for successfully validating transactions and adding blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain will be cut in half from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This mechanism is hard-coded into Bitcoin to enforce its finite supply - only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist.

Halvings can potentially influence Bitcoin's price due to increased scarcity. When new Bitcoins become harder to get, existing ones become proportionally more scarce. If demand for Bitcoin remains high or grows, this increased scarcity could lead to upward price pressure. Additionally, halvings help ensure the long-term security of the Bitcoin network by keeping the mining process profitable. This continued incentive keeps miners dedicating their resources, maintaining Bitcoin's security and integrity.

Bloomberg reported yesterday that as the next Bitcoin halving event approaches, thousands of older mining computers in the US are set to be decommissioned for resale and relocation overseas. SunnySide Digital, a Colorado-based wholesaler, is preparing its facility to refurbish and export these machines to locations where electricity costs are significantly lower. With electricity being the primary expense for miners, publicly-traded giants like Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) are under pressure to maximize efficiency for continued profitability. Older machines simply may not generate enough Bitcoin revenue to justify US operating costs. Taras Kulyk, CEO of SunnySide Digital, revealed they've sold machines to buyers in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Luxor Technology estimates that around 600,000 S19 series machines, a widely used model, are being relocated overseas.

As Forbes reported last month, on February 15, the Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the government's investment arm, signed a $250 million agreement with Hong Kong-based West Data Group's Center Service PLC. This partnership aims to establish state-of-the-art infrastructure dedicated to Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence. This landmark deal, as noted by Kal Kassa, CEO for Ethiopia at Hashlabs Mining, aligns with Ethiopia's broader strategy to stimulate economic development through technology and attract foreign investment. With the African data center market projected to reach $5.4 billion by 2027 (according to Aritzon Advisory and Intelligence), Ethiopia is positioning itself for significant leadership in this sector.

Miners who choose to export their older machines often do so due to the allure of drastically lower energy prices, Bloomberg explains. This potential cost reduction becomes even more critical in the face of Bitcoin's halving, which could make it unprofitable to operate less efficient machines in the US. Luxor Technology's Ethan Vera believes buyers are strategically looking for the cheapest electricity possible.

Bloomberg notes that not all US-based miners sell their older machines. Some, like Nuo Xu, choose to physically relocate to areas with lower costs. Xu intends to explore options in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and other countries, hoping to cut operating expenses, including labor and building materials. Jaran Mellerud, CEO of Hashlabs Mining, echoes this sentiment, highlighting Ethiopia's competitive hosting fees and increasing appeal to miners due to relaxed regulations.

Bloomberg acknowledges potential risks for US miners operating overseas, including machine damage during transport, security concerns, and the complexities of international logistics. Publicly traded companies also face stricter scrutiny from shareholders, making relocation more complex. Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital Inc., exemplifies this by revealing their practice of keeping older machines in storage in case high Bitcoin prices make them temporarily profitable again.

Despite hurdles, the pre-halving upgrade cycle is in full swing. Bloomberg highlights that Bitcoin miners have been preparing for years. The 13 largest public mining companies have apparently invested over $1 billion in new machines since February 2023.",cryptoglobe.com,news,CryptoGlobe,,0.2549019607843137,448963247,1,https://media.cryptoglobe.com/2022/11/bitcoin-g01e7c9c54_1920-768x539.jpg,eng-9420526

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

Scientists are warning climate change could affect the size and price of your chocolate Easter eggs.

Extreme weather in West Africa - which supplies more than 60 percent of the world's cocoa - has seen prices soar to record highs.

This decadent sweet treat could soon become a luxury item as cocoa prices soar.

""Unfortunately this month we've seen that, that price is now being passed on to us and therefore eventually it will result in a few price increases,"" said House of Chocolate sales manager Tori Connell.

Cocoa hit a record US$8653 (NZ$14,430) per metric tonne this week - a 200 percent increase on the same time last year.

And like many, this boutique chocolatier on Auckland's North Shore relies heavily on produce from West Africa.

""We have a great relationship with our supplier, we've been doing this for 25 years, so have been working alongside people for a very long time, and they've absorbed a lot of the increase up until now,"" Connell said.

Scientists say it's an ominous sign of climate change as extreme weather affects the fragile ecosystem cocoa needs to grow.

Torrential rain in December caused one West African farmer's crop to be blighted by fungus.

The damage done then is now being exacerbated by drought - with temperatures exceeding 40C last month.

""If we don't stop burning fossil fuels now and also invest in making cocoa plantations more resilient, chocolate will become much more of a luxury product,"" climate scientist Dr Fredi Otto warned.

In the spirit of Easter, House of Chocolate is absorbing the cost increase this year - but knows they'll have to innovate in the future if they're to keep the price of their handmade delicacies down.

""We're really working on new techniques and revised products that would allow us to, not pass on too much of a price increase for our customer,"" Connell said.

But not all companies will be able to sweeten the deal - a worrying sign for our wallets, but far more serious for the West African nations now confronting climate change.",newshub.co.nz,news,Newshub,Lucy Thomson,0.1137254901960785,448963139,1,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/lifestyle/2024/03/climate-change-sparks-concerns-for-chocolate-s-future/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1711263949920/getty-CHOCOLATE-GENERIC-1120.jpg,eng-9414228

Introducing biodegradable microplastics -- a groundbreaking solution to one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Recent research conducted by the University of California - San Diego and Algenesis has unveiled a promising alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics and microplastics. Unlike their persistent counterparts, these plant-based polymers biodegrade within a remarkably short period -- under seven months.

The urgency of finding substitutes for conventional plastics cannot be overstated. Microplastics, those tiny, virtually indestructible particles, pervade our oceans, soil, and now, even our bodies. With decomposition periods spanning centuries, the accumulation of microplastics poses a significant threat to our environment and health.

The innovative breakthrough lies in the development of algae-based polymers, conceived six years ago with complete biodegradability as the primary goal. Through meticulous experimentation, researchers confirmed that these polymers disintegrate even at the microplastic level, offering hope for a cleaner future.

To validate their findings, the team subjected the material to rigorous testing methodologies. Utilizing respirometry, water flotation, and chemical analysis, they observed a remarkable degradation rate, surpassing industry standards for biodegradability.

Notably, the algae-based microplastics exhibited a stark contrast to their petroleum-based counterparts. While the latter remained virtually intact even after 200 days, a staggering 97% of the former had vanished, leaving no trace of harmful residues.

Moreover, this revolutionary material eliminates the production of microplastics during its usage, marking a significant milestone in sustainable plastic manufacturing. With meticulous scanning-electron microscopy revealing the colonization of biodegradable microplastics by beneficial microorganisms during composting, the ecological benefits are undeniable.

Transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives presents challenges, particularly in retrofitting existing manufacturing infrastructure. However, partnerships with leading companies demonstrate promising progress towards integrating plant-based polymers into various consumer products, from coated fabrics to cell phone cases.

While there is much work ahead, the success of this research underscores the feasibility of a plastic-free future. By harnessing the power of nature, we can mitigate the environmental and health risks posed by traditional plastics, offering a glimmer of hope for generations to come.",gadgets360.com,news,NDTV Gadgets 360,,0.1372549019607843,448963129,1,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-03/1n233t4g_plastic-unsplash_625x300_23_March_24.jpg,eng-9414388

In an inspiring display of environmental stewardship, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) made a significant contribution to the global Earth Hour initiative on March 23rd, 2024. Marking a pledge to sustainability, the airport turned off its non-essential lighting from 20:30 to 21:30 hours, showcasing a united front in the fight against climate change. This deliberate action covered various sectors of the airport, including the Juliet apron, Runway 32, and both departure and arrival areas of the Duty-Free, along with international and domestic lounges.

The event saw a comprehensive engagement from multiple on-ground teams such as E&M, Apron, Terminal Operations, Environment, Non-aero commercial, Duty-Free lounge, and MLCP. These teams were instrumental in ensuring the meticulous planning and execution of this initiative, maintaining a seamless operation while adhering strictly to safety protocols throughout the hour-long event. Their collaboration highlighted the airport's internal coordination capabilities and its commitment to executing eco-friendly initiatives efficiently.

CSMIA's participation in Earth Hour is more than a symbolic act; it's a testament to their ongoing dedication to sustainable practices and environmental responsibility. By switching off non-essential lights, the airport not only contributed to energy conservation but also aimed to spark a broader conversation on the importance of sustainable actions among its stakeholders and the wider community.

This initiative is a clear reflection of CSMIA's commitment to balancing operational excellence with environmental stewardship. Importantly, the observance of Earth Hour at the airport did not affect flight operations, demonstrating that environmental initiatives can coexist with the demands of maintaining high standards of service and efficiency.

Fijian climate activist Fenton Lutunatabua is no stranger to the climate change scene, having done environmental work since he was a teenager and throughout his youth.

However, this is his first time being a part of the world's largest indigenous film festival, Maoriland where his short film Vakaraitaka had its world premiere.

The storyteller heard about how important the festival is for indigenous filmmakers. His four-part visual poem touches on climate justice, climate activism and community organising in the Pacific.

As an activist and a community organiser, his project of love was born out of the Covid-19 pandemic and took three years to make.

""I dreamed about it for over a year...I really wanted to be in that space,"" he said.

""So much of this film is about Pacific identity... it just makes a lot of sense that the world premiere would be at such a prestigious festival.""

Vakaraitaka means to reveal - the idea of how we uncover something.

""It's often like who voices whose story. Often the climate activist story is a white story, right?""

Growing up in the climate movement, it was difficult for Lutunatabua to see himself in that space.

""It's really hard. It's also really hard to do activism whilst being deeply rooted in culture.

""As I near my forties, I really want to just be like: 'Hey, this is my journey as a young indigenous man from the Fiji islands, who grew up in a predominantly white climate movement'.

""We're in the climate space. We're in this movement, we're having these hard conversations and fighting these giant fights.""

The first poem is called Tinaqu = the Fijian word for mother.

""It's an ode; like our elders and ancestors who have done the hard work protecting our homes and we inherit all the beautiful places that we call home from them.""

Lutunatabua specifically wrote about his mothers and aunties; reminiscing about memories on their front porch on a mat. His mother and her sisters would talk about where they used to go and bathe and pick guava and coconuts from.

""I was sitting there and just thinking about how important the place is to [our] story. We were in this village, surrounded by family, surrounded by community and hearing so much of the past.""

""So it's like storytelling and poetry and dance,"" he says.

""The climate crisis is huge and real and we will lose a lot of important things. How do we as Pacific people grapple with that? How do we still hold on to hope as we hold on to grief?""

Lutunatabua has done photography work and created social media content. He shares his background in radio and his podcast Beyond the Narrative.

""I dabbled with different platforms and I think it's time for me to push myself and challenge myself with film. I wanted it to also be multidisciplinary.""

He worked with the local Fijian dance group Wehi and renowned fashion designer KuiViti, who specifically works with masi (Fijian tapa cloth). He also worked with a young man from Guam who scored the film.

""Everyone that touched the film had proximity to the Pacific.""

The places and locations shot are very important places for Lutunatuba. He says when his son gets older he can show him the film, these places of significance and why.

""My wife and I eloped in the mountains and we got married in the mountains where we shot.""

All the props in the film have a special connection to Lutunatabua and were either owned by his mother, were gifted by a friend or had a cool background story.

""I wanted to represent different parts of my life as a climate activist and different gifts that I've been given from people across the Pacific and for my family.""

He hopes the next generation is curious and inspired to join the climate movement.

Climate policies have become the biggest point of contention between Labor and the Coalition, with the two sides warring over which achieves a combined outcome of emission reductions and provision of energy relief to financially burdened households.

Members of the opposition have dismissed the government's assertions of nuclear being an expensive and environmentally-detrimental means of power, along with being an industry that would take too long to get up and running in Australia.

The Coalition is questioning why the government cannot look to incorporate nuclear in the energy mix by building small modular reactors (SMR) like its other Western counterparts including Canada, UK, and the US.

Canada, which has embraced nuclear in both small and large-scale capacities and cemented its status as a world leader in research and technology of the electricity source, generates about 15 per cent of its total power through SMRs.

Discussing the nation's energy operations exclusively with Sky News Australia, Energy Minister for Ontario Todd Smith said Australia should model itself on Canada's thriving nuclear industry which was ""at the forefront of the Western world"".

""One of the things that we have been able to do is eliminate coal from our system and I know that's something that you're aiming to do in Australia as well,"" he told Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood in an exclusive interview.

""The biggest reason why we were able to eliminate coal was because we have that reliable, baseload, emissions-free nuclear fleet that we continue to build on, to ensure that we have a green system in Ontario. And it's one of the cleanest electricity grids in the entire world, at about 90 per cent emissions-free.""

In Ontario, which is Canada's most populated state, about 50 to 60 per cent of electricity generation comes from 19 operable Candu reactors - a model pioneered by Canada - including what is the world's largest operating nuclear facility at Bruce Power.

Mr Smith said nuclear had not just helped bring down the cost of electricity but also helped tackle the ""intermittent, unreliable"" issues of generating renewable power amid periods of unfavourable weather including lacking sunlight and slow winds.

""Wind and solar installations just aren't there when you need them,"" the Canadian energy minister said.

""This sounds elementary but the sun doesn't shine at night. So your solar disappears at night. The wind... quite often, only produces at night.

""Both of them have capacity factors, meaning they are there only about 25 to 35 per cent of the time, whereas the nuclear facilities that we have in Ontario are there 94 to 97 per cent of the time, 365 days a year, 24-seven. You can count on them and we have counted on them for the last 40 to 50 years in Ontario.""

Mr Smith was also questioned about declarations by Australia's Climate Council that developing nuclear power would take too long to make a significant difference to energy output and the positive climate change and decarbonisation result Australia is seeking.

In response, the energy minister said an SMR which has been under development in Ontario's Darlington since 2022 was expected to be completed and functioning by late 2028 or early 2029.

This time period is in stark contrast to figures floated by the Albanese government, who claim it would take a minimum of 19 years to build a nuclear power plant.

Meanwhile, the Coalition's timeline for nuclear power to be instated in Australia is 10 years.

Mr Smith said embracing nuclear also had far-reaching benefits for the economy and would complement a renewable energy market, as it was a lucrative industry for investments, including from automakers, EV battery manufacturers, and green steel-making producers.

""Our population is growing as fast as it is, is because we have reliable, affordable electricity that comes from our nuclear facilities, our hydro facilities... we're preparing for the future so we can continue to see these types of investments and growth,"" he said.

""(We realised) if we want to hit the climate targets that have been set by the federal government, that there's really only one way that you can do that, and that's with reliable, affordable baseload power that really only comes from small modular reactors or large reactors.""

This has been achieved by using 'double composite' structures which use less concrete and steel.

The news comes as engineers at Westbury, on the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire border, were installing the second viaduct deck.

This design change followed the early success of HS2's first double composite viaduct at Wendover Dean.

The new method draws on experiences from high-speed rail projects across Europe.

Unlike traditional single composite structures, where steel beams support a reinforced concrete deck, the double composite design adds a concrete bottom, drastically reducing the overall amount of concrete and steel used.

The production of steel and concrete is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in construction.

This move allowed the team to reduce the embedded carbon in the five viaducts - Westbury, Turweston, Wendover, Small Dean and Lower Thorpe - by between 52 and 66 per cent.

HS2's head of civil structures, Tomas Garcia, said: ""HS2 will improve journeys between Britain's two biggest cities while freeing up more space on the most overcrowded parts of the existing mainline for more local services.

""The double composite approach - which combines the strength of steel in tension and with concrete in compression - has huge potential to cut carbon in construction by enabling more efficient bridges.

""I look forward to seeing them completed and hope the lessons we have learnt can be successfully applied to other bridge projects across the UK.""

One of the viaducts at Brackley is currently having its 320-metre-long double composite deck positioned.

The viaduct is part of HS2's project to better connect London, Birmingham and the North, with the potential to provide more train services on the busy southern end of the West Coast Main Line into London Euston.

Changes in the bridge's craftsmanship, including the use of low-carbon concrete and steel along with alternative foundations, helped the design panel cut the viaduct's embedded carbon by 60 per cent.

EKFB, made up of Eiffage, Kier, Ferrovial Construction and BAM Nuttall, is delivering civil engineering work on 80km of HS2.

Jose Candel, EKFB's design delivery director, said: ""The double composite design of this group of viaducts spanning Bucks and Northants is exemplary here in the UK.

""This industry-leading approach is innovating and paving the way for future infrastructure projects which will not only benefit on-site construction but supports EKFB's drive to reduce a huge amount of carbon in the process.""

He pointed out the lack of motivation and irresponsible behavior among young students, along with a declining interest of teachers in their profession.

He said this while addressing a training session for visiting teachers held under the supervision of Professor Dr. Saeed Akhtar (Dean, Faculty of food and Nutrition) at the Department of Human Nutrition, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. Dr Tauseef maintained that a large number of students in Pakistan possessed degrees but unfortunately many lacked practical skills. They are faced with difficulty to deal with any challenges or present their viewpoints effectively, said Tauseef.

The session was attended by distinguished guests including Dr. Aamir Riaz as a trainer who addressed the general issues faced by students and faculty members.

Dr. Aamir Riaz, in his motivational lecture, highlighted that only 10% people worldwide were truly successful, while the remaining 90% merely strive for success without proper direction thus leading to failures due to lack of focus.

He stated, nature has not destined anyone to failure rather, success or failure depends on individual choices. Success is essentially a continuous effort, as each failure brings one step closer to success, he claimed.

He encouraged incorporating positive thinking into life and stating that success was not a miracle but a reflection of one's mindset.

Highlighting the importance of talent acquisition, he stated that talent was a divine gift that did not necessarily require formal education.

He urged students to define their mission statements, as this serve as a guide towards achieving goals and establishing identity.

Dr. Riaz remarked that the participants should not care fear of failure as it was a major obstacle to success. He provided some more useful guidelines to the participants, describing the qualities of an excellent teacher.

Dr Aamir observed that character and abilities were crucial factors for establishing one's position in society.

With South Africa possessing all the ingredients to make and export hydrogen, the country could become a major world player, with benefits even extending to farmers.

The Netherlands' coastline is a cool and windy place on the best of days. It's hardly the kind of beach destination South Africans are used to, but it does have monumental benefits: wind power generation.

The Dutch have certainly capitalised on this gift from nature, and wind turbines span across the ocean as far as the eye can see. But it's not enough.

READ Wind farms: a massive opportunity for SA's farmers

Shortly after the Russians declared war on Ukraine, the EU shunned Russian gas. The urgency to reduce carbon emissions has also driven the continent to seek more green energy, with the Netherlands shutting down their own gas fields last year.

Erecting enough wind turbines across the North Sea to meet their green energy requirements, and transforming the mostly gas-suited energy infrastructure, could take up to 10 years to establish, and come at a considerable cost.

Green hydrogen poses an ideal solution, but only if they can procure enough of it. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity in an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.

The Dutch's attention has therefore shifted south, where sunshine is abundant, and South Africa's west coast presents an ideal location for using desalinated water and solar energy to produce hydrogen, which can then be exported through purpose-built ports.

Should investment in green hydrogen production in South Africa materialise, and the country does indeed become the hydrogen powerhouse it is realising it could be, benefits to African and European economies will be plentiful.

President Cyril Ramaphosa recently stated that the hydrogen economy has the potential to add 3,6% to South Africa's GDP by 2050, and around 370 000 jobs.

Should South Africa use green hydrogen in its own energy mix, Ramaphosa estimates that it would remove 10% to 15% of our domestic emissions and contribute to the country's long-term energy security.

Benefits for South Africans and the Dutch aside, it is estimated that green hydrogen would need to make up 10% to 20% of the global energy mix to limit global warming to less than 1,5°C. With demand this high, South Africa will need to prioritise hydrogen production to scoop up the enormous benefits.

The Minister in the Presidency for Electricity, Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, stated that existing infrastructure like ports and renewable energy sources can be leveraged for green hydrogen production.

READ Energy storage can enhance SA agriculture

""The Western Cape plans to develop Saldanha Bay into a green hydrogen production centre, with the Atlantis Special Economic Zone as a key hub for green hydrogen value-chain components.

The Northern Cape has finalised its Green Hydrogen Roadmap, with potential investments ranging from R5,7 trillion to R9,5 trillion by 2050. The Eastern Cape plans to implement its strategy primarily in the Coega Special Economic Zone.

Green hydrogen can contribute significantly to the national revenue funds of many African countries. Ramokgopa put the figure at R380 billion annually.

""It's revenue that can be used to expand social infrastructure, improve the quality of life of our people and ensure that we put Africa on a pedestal for significant growth going into the future.""

The estimated cost to produce hydrogen in South Africa, coupled with closer proximity to Europe than countries like Chile and Australia, makes it more cost effective for the Dutch to import this energy from South Africa.

Ramokgopa said Sub-Saharan Africa's renewable energy resources have the capacity to produce between 5 000 and 13 000 million tons of green hydrogen per year, at a cost of around R38/kg, by 2050. This would make green hydrogen financially competitive against other energy sources.

But getting to the R38/kg price point will take time and considerable investment in new, leaner technologies. For now, the price is expected to be around double that, which could dampen global appetites for South African hydrogen.

Ramokgopa said the cost of green hydrogen for the end user would be so prohibitive for South Africans that it had not been included in the updated Integrated Resources Plan.

The road to mass hydrogen production is eye-wateringly expensive as it requires an entirely new industry to be built.

This includes all the infrastructure that goes with it: new ports that can handle gas exports, solar and wind farms that are connected to a grid that can receive power, rather than provide, pipelines and railways to transport gas across the country, desalination plants, and the hydrogen plants themselves.

South Africa has plans to launch the SA-H2 Fund, a blended finance fund that will facilitate the development of the hydrogen sector.

The aim is to attract R19 billion in funding. With Africa being favourably looked upon for assistance with Europe's green transition, financing has become readily available.

But Jörg Gigler, director of TKI New Gas in the Netherlands, raised a red flag for anyone wanting to profit from hydrogen projects and the money changing hands.

""Provisions for green financing take the stability of the country, and the global transparency and corruption rankings into account. There are countries in South America that would make excellent candidates for hydrogen production, but corruption is so rife that the banks refuse to finance them, so they can't get their projects off the ground,"" Gigler said.

He cautioned the South African government and private officials against corruption if they were to attain the financing they needed to make the hydrogen dream a reality.

While government has released information on hydrogen production targets, there have been no implementation plans to date.

In late October this year, Cabinet approved the Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy for implementation, with the goal of positioning South Africa as a major producer and exporter of green hydrogen.

This falls under the Department of Science and Innovation's Hydrogen Society Roadmap, which has set a target of having 10GW of electrolysis deployed and at least 500 000t of hydrogen production per year by 2030.

By 2040, capacity should be expanded to reach 15GW. On the demand side, the short-term focus is on the transport sector and demonstrating industrial technologies. The long-term roadmap envisions sector coupling and use of hydrogen in the power sector.

Private sector investments have also been slow, with Sasol being the only company in South Africa that has a hydrogen production facility up and running.

The facility, in Sasolburg is however only at the pilot stage, producing 150kg of green hydrogen per day since the plant started running in June this year.

They have set a target of reaching 5 500kg per day in 2024. Sasol however expects that it will take at least a decade for green hydrogen to become a fuel of choice for the company, as cost, infrastructure and regulations pose hurdles.

Going halfway around the world to procure green energy but then creating carbon emissions during the transport proses would be pointless. The hydrogen sector is therefore just as busy developing ways in which hydrogen can be shipped, in ships run on hydrogen-derived fuel.

Gigler noted that 90% of the Netherlands' hydrogen requirement will need to be imported. With deep sea transport contributing to 3% of global emissions, dirty transport will need to be addressed.

While hydrogen is relatively light, it does take up a lot of space, and Gigler stated that ships carrying 100 times the cargo they currently can, needed to be constructed to make transport safe, efficient and affordable.

South African challenges aside, there is one detail that plagues global hydrogen production, which could very well stifle any hopes of fully utilising this green energy.

Iridium is a vital ingredient in the electrolysis process that turns water and electricity into hydrogen. But the world is running out of this scarce metal.

Peter Paul van 't Veen, business development director of innovation for development at research organisation TNO in the Netherlands, says that South Africa currently supplies 90% of all the iridium used in the EU.

South Africa is, in fact, the largest producer of iridium in the world, which bodes well for developing our hydrogen sector. But since demand for iridium is already high, prices will continue to rise as hydrogen production increases globally, making the cost of producing this energy more expensive.

Unless iridium can be entirely replaced by another technology or ingredient that is more abundant, hydrogen production could be stopped in its tracks before we even reach 2050.

Talk about expanding solar production in South Africa is bound to grab the attention of farmers in the Northern and Western Cape. With rain being scarce, and fires common, earning a living from this dry land is challenging.

The abundant sunshine could however be the golden goose that will allow farmers to farm simply for the enjoyment thereof.

Willem Symington, president of Agri Northern Cape, said the region's farmers were excited by the economic injection the hydrogen sector would bring the province.

""Farmers could erect their own solar plants and sell the electricity, or they could rent the land to solar power companies who need to erect more solar farms. In certain areas, wind turbines are also feasible.

""With so many droughts, and with the climate set to get drier, it will be a huge benefit for farmers to have an alternative source of income.""

Possible benefits stretch beyond rental income, and the development of rail networks and ports that would come with a thriving hydrogen industry will have benefits for farmers too.

""If the port development in Boegoebaai goes ahead, it would be far closer for the Northern Cape's export-focused farmers to send their fruit there rather than to Cape Town. If railway lines were developed, we could see the mines shifting their cargo off the roads, which would ease the detrimental impact that the trucks have on our road infrastructure, Symington said.

A big caveat to the development of a hydrogen industry would be the assurance that the region's fresh water sources would not be touched.

""It is said that seawater will be desalinated and used in the hydrogen production process, but it is expensive and could make the cost prohibitive. Every drop of water flowing down the Orange River has already been accounted for, so using it is not an option.""",farmersweekly.co.za,news,Farmer's Weekly,Lindi Botha,0.3568627450980393,448962721,1,https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/app/uploads/2024/03/WIND-TURBINES.jpg,eng-9420914

The seventh-year veteran signed a 10-day contract Saturday as the team continues to struggle with depth following the season-ending injuries of Patrick Williams and Zach LaVine.

Green, 30, is a familiar face, having logged 113 games in Chicago over the last three seasons. He was a crucial contributor over that time, but a right knee injury in 2022-23 limited him to only 32 games.

Saturday night's matchup against the Boston Celtics marked his return to the Bulls and the NBA.

But the real reunion happened two weeks ago in San Francisco after a game against the Golden State Warriors.

Green spent the last two months playing with Santa Cruz, the Warriors' G League affiliate. So it was a natural decision to attend the March 7 game when the Bulls visited the Warriors.

Green waited outside the locker room for coach Billy Donovan, who wrapped him up in a hug upon seeing his former player.

Green's entry to the locker room that night was met with enthusiastic shouts as he greeted his former teammates.

""I just felt the love,"" Green said.

Barely two weeks later, Green received a call from the Bulls about coming back to Chicago on the shortterm deal.

It has been more than a year since Green played in an NBA game. He underwent an arthroscopic debridement in his right knee in January 2023, then played roughly 30 minutes over four games scattered from March 20 to April 7.

Many Ukrainians were plunged into darkness across several cities, at least five people were killed, and damage to the country's largest hydroelectric plant briefly cut off power to a nuclear plant that has been a safety risk throughout the war.

Russia fired off more than 60 exploding drones and 90 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as the most brutal attack against its energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began in early 2022.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, sustained the most damage, officials said, and the attack came a day after Russia had fired 31 missiles into the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Western allies for weeks to provide it with additional air-defense systems and ammunition, a period in which $60 billion in U.S. aid has been held up by divisions in Congress.

Smoke and fire are seen around high-voltage lines at a site of a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, outside Kharkiv, Ukraine, March 22, 2024.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state,' Zelenskyy said. ""It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions.""

Russia's defense ministry called the Friday attacks ""strikes of retribution."" Ukraine has increased shelling of Russia's Belgorod region along its northeast border and has launched drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries and other energy facilities.

Ukraine's latest strike inside Russia on Friday killed one person and injured at least three, according to local officials.

Putin has described Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod and other regions as an effort to frighten residents and derail the highly orchestrated election that ended Sunday. And he vowed to strike back.

The day after he declared victory, Putin said Russia would seek to create a buffer zone inside eastern Ukraine to help protect against long-range strikes and cross-border raids.

Russia has made progress on the battlefield in recent months against exhausted Ukrainian troops struggling with a shortage of manpower and ammunition along the front line that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).

When Putin invaded in 2022, he called it a ""special military operation,"" and his officials have mostly eschewed the word ""war."" But in a change of rhetoric Friday that may herald a new escalation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian newspaper that ""when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.""

In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts across the country. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat the strategy this winter, but Russia instead focused its strikes on Ukraine's defense industries.

While launching the strikes, Russia has combined sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles with waves of cheap Iranian-made Shahed drones in a bid to oversaturate and weaken Ukrainian air defenses.

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, head of the national utility Ukrenergo, described Friday's barrage as the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he said.

Kudrytskyi said that Russia 'tried to destroy every significant energy object powering the city of Kharkiv,"" leaving at least 700,000 without electricity. He estimated that several hundred thousand customers in other regions were also left without power.

In this photo provided by Telegram Channel of Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, smoke and fire rise over the Dnipro hydroelectric power plant after Russian attacks in Dnipro, Ukraine, March 22, 2024.

Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, said that 31 people were injured in the strikes, which also left 200,000 people without constant access to electricity in the Odesa region. He said that power supplies for most of 400,000 customers in the Dnipropetrovsk region were restored.

The huge Dnipro hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine's largest, halted operation after sustaining at least six missile hits that caused massive damage. Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhidroenergo company overseeing the country's hydroelectric plants, said it lost about a third of its generation capacity in a ""significant loss for the Ukrainian energy system.""

Syrota said that the extent of damage to the plant remained unclear because its equipment has been buried under concrete and metal debris from the blasts, noting that the repairs will be a ""long process.""

The strikes sparked a fire at the Dnipro plant, which supplies electricity to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. Power to the nuclear plant was lost for several hours before it was restored, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian troops since early days of the invasion, and fighting around it has raised the risk of a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding like what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper River collapsed.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.6941176470588235,448962479,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711197367.jpg,

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced the establishment of a bipartisan Artificial Intelligence Task Force in February.

The task force's members, including Florida Republican Kat Cammack, have already had a few organizational meetings and met with AI leaders to discuss, among other topics, November's election.

""This is a critical issue that is going to really have an impact in every aspect of our lives, from here moving forward into the future,"" Cammack told Fox News Digital.

""I think [members are] pretty much on the same page as far as we recognize both the challenges but also the opportunities that come with AI. ... Folks on the task force have a very pragmatic, forward-thinking, optimistic view of AI. But we are not blind to the fact that there are challenges""

AI WEAPON DETECTION COMPANY SEEKS TO PREVENT SCHOOL, OTHER SHOOTINGS: 'A PROACTIVE MEASURE'

Cammack says one of the immediate concerns of the task force is the impact AI will have in the 2024 election.

AI image tools generate election disinformation 41% of the time, and AI tools generate images promoting voting disinformation 59% of the time, according to a recent report published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Cammack says the task force is ""looking [to identify] some of the challenges that people are opening with AI-generated content, disclaimers [about] what that will mean in terms of deepfakes, how do we authenticate and watermark AI-generated content, images, videos, etc.""

SPEAKER JOHNSON MEETS WITH OPENAI CEO, SAYS CONGRESS 'NEEDS TO PLAY' ROLE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

The Center for Countering Digital Hate report found examples of image disinformation, such as a photo of President Biden sick in a hospital bed and a photo of former President Trump sitting in a jail cell.

Tech giant Meta requires paid users to disclose when potentially misleading AI-generated or altered content is featured in political, electoral or social issue ads.

""You'll have all these discussions about [how content] should be watermarked. ... We've already seen where AI can take off a watermark on an AI-generated product. That's just a Band-Aid,"" Cammack said. ""We need to get to the root solution and establish a protocol in place that will prevent mass confusion.""

Cammack says she and her team are working on a framework that would allow for a blockchain authentication model to exist.

""I see blockchain as a future mechanism to help authenticate material, and that will be really important for candidates and for legislators in such a rapid environment. Having your photos, your videos, all of your content authenticated with a very secure technology like blockchain, that will be very, very important,"" she said.

The Florida Republican said the task force should be wary of the overregulation of artificial intelligence, saying her focus will be to protect access in the marketplace for some of the smaller players and ensure there is no bias.

Fans often praise series that stick as close to the source material as possible, and shows like ""The Queen's Gambit"" and ""Sandman"" how taking a very faithful approach can be done well.

However, some of the most successful adaptations in recent years have been ones that transform the work substantially, staying true to the spirit rather than the letter of the novel. ""Good Omens,"" ""Interview With the Vampire"" and ""Watchman"" are all great examples of shows that introduce new storylines and characters while playing within the sandbox of an established world.

Netflix's newest series ""3 Body Problem"" falls somewhere in between these two extremes, managing to hit the major plot points of the novel that inspired it, while making substantial changes to the characters and settings of the book series.

Liu Cixin's mega-popular, award-winning ""Remembrances of Earth"" trilogy of novels was thought by many to be un-adaptable, due to its hard science fiction concepts and frequent timeline shifts. However, thanks to some smart structural and character changes, Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" shows how good adaptations can stay true to the source material while also creating a bold new vision at the same time.

Book readers might be initially shocked by the first episode of ""3 Body Problem,"" which introduces characters Jin, Saul, Jack, Auggie, and Will, a group of friends collectively known as the Oxford Five. None of these characters are present in the ""Three Body Problem"" book, but several of them serve as a stand-in for that book's protagonist, Professor Wang Miao, an applied physicist who unravels the conspiracy behind the Trisolaran threat.

By breaking Miao's character into several different people, there is more chance for dialogue and exposition, which makes the series a bit easier to follow. The wildly different timelines and settings can seem a little overwhelming, even for the most meticulous book reader and trying to cram all of that into one character (who doesn't appear after the first book) would have made the TV series a lot harder to follow in the future, if it continues beyond its inaugural season.

Other book characters from later in the series, including Cheng Xin and Yun Tianming are also repurposed into existing characters introduced in the series' first season, which should hopefully make future series easier to adapt as well since audiences will have familiar characters to follow from beginning to end.

And speaking of future seasons, another smart change from the book series that helps ""3-Body Problem"" is bringing future events from the sequel novels in the ""Remembrance of Earth's Past"" trilogy forward into season 1.

While they get new names, several characters that we meet in season 1 of the TV show take over roles and events from the sequel books, helping to flesh out the timeline and make a clear path forward, should further novels be adapted, without the need for additional flashbacks or timeline changes. ""3 Body Problem already has a very intricate plot, and introducing these characters earlier can help streamline the story in future seasons, making the separate timelines easier to follow.

One of the reasons why Liu Cixin's ""Remembrance of Earth"" trilogy is so beloved among sci-fi fans is because it doesn't shy away from complex, real world scientific concepts like celestial mechanics, theoretical physics and chaos theory.

Though the book does a good job of giving readers the basics so they can understand the plot, the TV show gives further explanations of these complex concepts on screen, complete with visualizations, making these difficult concepts feel much more accessible for a general audience.

""3 Body Problem"" may not be exactly like the book that inspired it, and while purists might miss Professor Wang Miao, the show's structural and character tweaks serve the narrative well. By making complex science digestible and streamlining the story for future seasons, Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" proves that bold adaptation can be a powerful tool for bringing beloved sci-fi epics to the small screen.",tomsguide.com,news,Tom's Guide,,0.4509803921568627,448962230,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iaPQ8eQiZp4eNRvVb9TJiX-1200-80.jpg,

To brush their teeth, wash vegetables or clean a bottle they have to use bottled water. A circumstance that has disrupted their lives and that has no easy solution (it is not expected that they will be able to drink from the tap until summer) nor a cheap one.

Compromís deputy Vicent Marzà asked about this issue in the last control session in Les Corts, who denounced the inaction of the regional government and the lack of response to the dozens of letters from neighbors asking for help. The Minister of Environment, Water and Infrastructure, Salomé Pradas, replied that the Executive is working on it and that the problem has been going on for a long time and that the left did nothing to solve it.

The mayor of Palma de Gandia, Paula Femenia (Compromís), explains to La Vanguardia that the Sant Miquel water well from which the municipality was supplied was declared unfit for consumption in 2019. As a temporary solution, an agreement was signed with the neighboring municipality of Ador to connect to its network provisionally and as long as both locations could be supplied. However, the mayor says, in 2023, due to Ador network problems, this drive was canceled leaving the residents of Palma without water in their mouths. Since October 11, the water is no longer drinkable.

The difficulties are evident for the almost 1,500 residents who were connected to this network (there are urbanizations with another connection that have been spared), but also for industries and businesses such as the oven or the bars of the municipality that consume more water. Since then, Femenia explains, the neighbors have been supplied with two and a half liters a day through 5-liter jugs. Before, a delivery was made four days a week, but now it has been reduced to two (Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.).

""In the town we all know each other, just come up and give your name and surname and the place where you live,"" says the first mayor. Businesses and industries are given an extra 15 bottles per week (75 liters).

The problem is that this formula does not work for companies like Coques de Dacsa Susana, an industry that produces the area's traditional corn cokes and which, explains its owner, Susana Serra, consumes 1,500 liters a week to produce 6,000-7,000 cokes a day. that it did before the water crisis.

Serra spoke to this newspaper a day after Thursday's distribution where he did not receive the 15 bottles he expected to have because ""there were no leftovers."" She tells how the situation has affected her ""100%"" although she prefers not to do numbers so as to ""not get sick."" Water is her raw material because to make the cocas she has to boil a large amount of water before making the dough.

That is another handicap because the bottled is at room temperature and boiling it from that temperature means a delay in production. ""It costs me twice as much to make them,"" he explains while pointing out that, to all the extra expenses, he has had to add the purchase of more machinery to try to maintain the production rate and meet his clients.

Faced with this complicated situation, the mayor of Palma de Gandia complains that they have asked the administrations for help and direct and nominative help to the Provincial Council of Valencia without success. The provincial institution refutes that the Pla Obert d'Inversions for the next four years foresees an investment in Palma de Gandia of 1,036,000 euros, 220,000 euros more than in the last legislature. To this, she argues, we must add the part that she will receive from the Municipal Cooperation Fund, which in the last legislature greatly exceeded half a million euros.

However, the mayor doubts that this money can be used on this issue. The City Council, at the moment, the only solution it has found is to connect to the well of the Mancomunidad de la Safor that is in Villalonga, for which a pipeline of more than one million euros is necessary, explains Femenia. If we take into account that the City Council's budget is barely 1.9 million and more than half goes to chapter 1 of personnel expenses, we can see the investment that this represents for a town hall as small as Palma de Gandia.

Despite this, after a financing agreement with its water manager, the City Council has managed to finance the work that has already begun to be built, with the idea of being able to have water again in the summer, when the town's population grows and, In addition, more water is consumed. However, this work is not free for residents who have to pay 6.26 euros per month on their bill for 25 years (more than 1,870 euros), unless the City Council first finds a source of financing that allows this to be amortized. investment and reduce the years of mortgage.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,Oliver Thansan,-0.0117647058823529,448962228,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_88821.png,

The Indian auto industry is gearing up to roll out an array of electric vehicle models over the next few years amid a renewed push by the government to encourage environment-friendly mobility solutions with the unveiling of a new policy.

Mass market players like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors are lining up new models to cater to the demand across segments.

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs. ""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc. ""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV. Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026. The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV. Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said. This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030. The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

With cruise operators set to start contributing to the European Union's emissions trading program, the global Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, wants ""countries to be able to reinvest all, or at least some, of this extra revenue into infrastructure,"" Europe Director General Marie-Caroline Laurent said in an interview.

The sums are not inconsiderable.

Europe's cruise sector is slated to contribute more than $655 million to the emissions program, known as ETS, starting in 2026, Laurent said.

But at least part of that total would be better used if it were redeployed toward clean infrastructure for the industry -- in areas from reduced emissions at berth and at sea, to programs for sustainable facilities at destination ports, Laurent said.

Infrastructure is a ""key concern,"" Laurent said, as electrification of ports and refueling facilities will be essential for the industry's future.

Few industries have faced a tougher post-pandemic challenge than cruise lines. Even after a sharp rally last year, shares have yet to snap back to pre-pandemic highs. Non-fuel costs -- fleet maintenance, food and onboard services -- are also expected to rise in coming quarters.

Currently about half of the industry's vessels are set up for next-generation shore-side electricity, Laurent said. That puts the onus on ports to update facilities.

""We obviously need the ports to be equipped with the newest outlets and to have electrification capability,"" she said.

For a possible model, Laurent pointed to the aviation sector, where sustainable SAF fuel is rated zero-emission and doesn't count toward emissions calculations.

For cruise operators, ""this kind of mechanism would be a good way to accelerate the deployment of alternative fuels,"" Laurent said.",nwaonline.com,news,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,,0.05098039215686279,448961878,1,https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/206809042_cruise_3FGRN77AVVHWPMDIRUOQO7M4X4_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676,

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Among these, the Ethereum presale of 2014 stands out as a landmark event. A select group of investors gained early access to Ether tokens at a discounted rate of $0.31 per ETH. Imagine how lucky these savvy investors were to snatch up this undervalued crypto gem and turn their modest investments into fortunes.

Why Is It a Good Idea to Buy Presale Tokens?

The crypto market is notorious for high volatility, but presale projects stand out as a beacon of predictability, as their price is pinned to a certain level until they get listed on a DEX. So, they are immune to market fluctuations.

The second reason is the low price. As in the Ethereum example above, its presale price was exponentially lower than its post-listing price. Similarly, most emerging projects aim to raise some capital, so they try to attract investors with highly favorable offers.

Why Is It a Good Idea to Buy BlastUP Tokens?

A myriad of emerging projects are vying for investors' attention. The competition is fierce, but certain contenders with a strong concept and high utility clearly stand out. Unlike many junk tokens, such as meme coins, whose value is based solely on the hype around them, the projects with real practical use have a more solid foundation.

BlastUP is the first launchpad on the Blast blockchain, a unique Layer 2 solution offering a native yield of 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. This groundbreaking approach has made Blast quite popular, and it has already attracted a huge army of fans, hitting a $1 billion in TLV in just one month. Moreover, the recent launch of the Blast Mainnet has pushed it to the top 10 projects in terms of TLV. Being a part of such a robust ecosystem, BlastUP is already ticking the boxes for its reliability.

The presale of BlastUP tokens ($BLP) is currently running, and buying them now could be compared with investing in ETH during its presale. The current BLP value is pinned at merely 5 US cents, while its listing price is set at $0.1, which already makes a 50% ROI.

Those who buy BlastUP tokens at the presale stage get access to exclusive early benefits including participation in an Airdrop to get free $BLP tokens. The utility of BlastUP tokens spreads far and wide, offering its users access to:

Moreover, $BLP holders get Booster Points, special tokens that BlastUP is launching to support the community. Booster Point is a fuel for the Community Incentives Program (CIP) intended for the creation of a solid base for launching projects and making them successful.

In just one month, BlastUP has attracted over $2.5 million in investments, which speaks much for its wide recognition. The presale runs until the end of May, so it's not too late to buy a possible crypto gem at the best price.

In this piece of great investigative journalism, we learned from interviewed experts that proposed technologies for characterizing the seafloor in support of understanding the feasibility of turbine anchoring/infrastructure have been/are employed by a multitude of organizations, with negligible impact to sea life. Onboard marine biologists will temporarily stop the survey if endangered species are observed. Biological surveys are planned for environmental impact studies along with identifying potential mitigating actions.

Yet the Morro Bay Group REACT is against the ocean surveys and plans to protest offshore wind at every step. REACT's leader indicated that they would consider taking money from the fossil fuel industry if it came down to a lawsuit. Really? REACT is open to taking money from an industry that has spread disinformation about climate change for decades and now admits to plans for unfettered oil and gas production going forward? That is extreme.

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for the excellent ""reality check"" article on the environmental impact of surveys conducted for proposed offshore wind (OSW) projects. Having worked for the city of Morro Bay, I know many of the folks in the REACT group and worked side-by-side with some of them to make Morro Bay the beautiful place that it is today. It saddens me to see them taking positions against OSW based on inaccurate information and, in turn, spreading that misinformation in the community.

I, too, have concerns about OSW and its impact on the local environment, but I try not to forget the bigger picture. Whales and other marine creatures are facing a present and growing threat from climate change fueled by the burning of fossil fuels. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt feeding grounds, alter migration patterns and harm vital ecosystems. As krill populations shift due to warming, whales struggle to find food, impacting their health and reproduction.

The transition to clean energy such as OSW is needed now and can be done responsibly. The future of the whales and the health of our planet depends on it!

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for your vital new ""reality check"" series and for including offshore wind development as the first topic of interest. We know that the climate crisis is largely caused by fossil fuels. As we work to preserve a livable world for future generations, we need to be well informed on the facts about sustainable energy sources, including one of the cleanest: wind energy. For constructive public discourse and sound decision-making to take place, we should inform ourselves with facts from trustworthy sources and data-driven research.

Your well researched articles clarify that the ocean surveys off the San Luis Obispo County coastline will be following safe, established practices. When it comes to our oceans, we should remember that it is climate change caused by using fossil fuels that is threatening marine life.

It is good news that many nations are adopting offshore wind as a major tool to transition to carbon free electricity. Just this month, America's first commercial scale offshore wind farm began delivering clean power to New York's electric grid. Later this year, another offshore wind farm will begin powering homes and businesses in Massachusetts. We need to be equally forward-looking in California.

""SLO readers opposed battery storage plant in Morro Bay,"" (sanluisobispo.com, Sept. 22, 2023)

Under Assembly Bill 205, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022, energy bills would take into account customers' incomes. People protested to the California Public Utilities Commission, asking them to either reject the proposal (partly because it would not reward customers who work hard to reduce energy usage) or provide guidance to the Legislature to change the law in a way that does not harm the middle class.

Reality Check: Is this law going to be implemented? Are rates going to be based on customers' incomes? Is that section taking effect? If so, when?

Another section of AB 205 applies to the permitting process of green energy projects, providing an expedited pathway for approval of projects that address climate change. The California Energy Commission could conceivably intervene and fast-track such a project.

Has this process been utilized by the CEC? How will this affect local control (such as in the case of the Morro Bay battery storage plant)?

That said, Hur is an experienced prosecutor who is qualified to assess how a prosecution would go in front of a jury -- which is what he did. He followed the facts and the law and concluded that Biden should not be prosecuted, noting the huge differences between this case and the classified documents case against Donald Trump.

While we may feel that statements in Hur's report about Biden's memory were political, we should celebrate the fact that the Biden White House allowed a Trump appointee to do his job without political interference -- a process which would not have happened under the prior administration.

This should also put to rest Republican claims that the Department of Justice has somehow been ""weaponized"" against Trump and his cronies. In fact, Biden has bent over backwards to keep prosecutorial decisions at the DOJ from being politicized. As a country, we should be very proud of that.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.06666666666666665,448960941,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/san_luis_obispo_tribune_mcclatchy_articles_722/c764dcf57c330313b3b61c4248baa32a,

""As we are invited to meditate on Jesus' journey to the Cross and beyond, this is also an opportune time for devout Catholics to reflect on how plastic pollution caused mainly by single-use plastics (SUPs) is affecting the People and the Planet,"" said Ochie Tolentino, zero waste campaigner of EcoWaste Coalition.

""We appeal to the faithful to steer away from the insidious throw-away culture that is turning our lands and oceans into dumping grounds and observe climate-friendly and SUP-free practices for the sake of our environment,"" she added.

EcoWaste Coalition expressed concern about the potential increase in plastic waste generated by religious activities during Holy Week, including visits to churches, pilgrimages, and the traditional ""pabasa.""

In previous years, the coalition documented widespread littering at churches and pilgrimage sites. The most common discards were disposable plastic items, cigarette butts and food containers.

""We hope that unlike the previous Holy Weeks, the pilgrims will take 'cleanliness is next to godliness' to heart, lessen their usage of SUPs and never drop any litter during their observance of the Holy Week,"" Tolentino said.

He added that it lift Australia's profile as a destination for global sustainable finance and be used has a point of reference for other securities to be issued off.

""The issuance will create increased global interest in Australian dollar denominated green bonds, and encourage state governments and corporates to expand their own green bond programs,"" Liddell said.

The manifesto highlights key areas such as the revitalization of the Assam tea industry, enhancements in education and healthcare, employment generation, and addressing flood-related challenges.

During the event, Timarpur MLA Dilip Pandey, the party's chief whip, criticized the BJP government for its failure to fulfill promises made to the people.

""Since coming to power in 2014, the BJP has made numerous commitments but has fallen short on delivery. In contrast, under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, our party has diligently pursued developmental initiatives. Unfortunately, the BJP seems more interested in hindering progress.

""The recent arrest of Arvind Kejriwal by the Enforcement Directorate is a blatant misuse of power and a violation of constitutional norms,"" Pandey remarked while campaigning for Manoj Dhanowar, the AAP's candidate for the Dibrugarh Lok Sabha seat.

Pandey also highlighted the contrast between the education policies of the AAP-led Delhi government and the actions of the Assam government.

""While Assam is witnessing the closure of government schools, we are dedicated to bolstering them. Delhi's government schools serve as a model for providing quality education with all necessary facilities. Unlike others, we believe in delivering on our promises, not making hollow commitments,"" Pandey emphasized.

Manoj Dhanowar, the AAP's candidate for the Dibrugarh Lok Sabha seat, pledged to prioritize public service if elected.

""Our struggle transcends mere political rivalries; it's about safeguarding democracy, which is currently under threat. The neglect of the tea industry by the government is concerning.

I must confess, this week, I felt pretty fed up. It was the council tax bill that did it.

I'd been going through the bills for the year ahead and I was updating my spreadsheet so I could see what I had to pay in 2024 and adjust my spending. After a massive water bill increase, the council tax bill was the final straw.

If you're feeling the same, don't despair. I've written quite a bit about how to get back on top of your finances. You can also find my guide on what to do if you're overstretched financially at the end of this article.

However, if like me, you're fed up with the bills, you might be tempted to do a bit of spring cleaning with your life more generally. April is a great time to turn over a new leaf not only with money, but with health, work and leisure too.

The problem with making plans is it's easy to get overwhelmed and give up. So speaking as someone who's made many, many false starts, here's my guide to making attainable plans that will make you feel better and help make your good intentions come true.

Know what you're likely to stick with

Sometimes the act of writing things down - or even talking through your plans with a friend - can help you figure out what it is you want to do in the year ahead. By all means make long lists, download apps and have big plans. Then stop and ask yourself: can you update these lists in less than 15 minutes each week? How much time a day would it take to do everything you want?

Psychologically, failing to succeed with even one aspect of a plan can set many people spiralling down a cycle where they give up on all their good intentions. So start small and make your goals attainable. You can always add more things from your 'big list' in to your plans as you make progress.

Divide your lists in to groups

My current ""to do2 list currently features 156 different tasks. That's way too much for me to realistically process. So divide up your lists in to separate chunks to make them more manageable. My list breaks down in to: bills, finances, complaints, health and lifestyle, fun stuff and friends and family. You might want to add an ""urgent"" column too for things that you absolutely have to prioritise.

Tackle what's annoyed you

Negative emotions aren't healthy, but if a business has annoyed you, use that to motivate you to find a better deal elsewhere. Have a think about the poor service you've experienced over the last year and note down the businesses that you've had enough of.

Next up, make yourself a complaint template. All this needs to involve is three things. A one-line overview of the main issue, a summary with around five bullet points setting out the main problems and one line specifying what you want to resolve the matter. Sticking to this template means it'll take five minutes to draft up a complaint, which you can then email or simply spell out on the phone. How a business deals with your complaint can help you get a decent resolution... or find the determination to go elsewhere.

Don't shell out for resolutions

If you're feeling motivated and ready to make some positive life changes, it's tempting to fork out some cash on the projects you've committed to. But resist the urge to spend money until you've proved to yourself you can meet a few basic targets.

We waste millions on membership schemes, health plans and life improvements every year because businesses know that we are less inclined to cancel subscriptions - because that means admitting defeat. So use free, trial versions of apps or contracts first to see if they work for you before committing. Try YouTube exercise videos that don't require equipment to get you started and check out our podcasts and mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram>Instagram posts to get motivated. You can also experiment with some free online recipes before spending lots of cash on a monthly delivery of healthy or exotic food ingredients.

To fail is to be human

As anyone who is avoiding booze or fags, or is trying to live a healthier life will know, there will be setbacks on the road to changing your life for the better. If you fall off the wagon or fail to meet the targets you've set for yourself, don't give up or think you've got to start over. Get a cheap wall calendar in the sales and mark off the days you've (mostly) achieved your goals along with those you haven't. You'll see you're winning more than you think. And give yourself a break.

What to do if you can't pay the bills

Sometimes when you do the sums, it turns out you don't have enough cash to pay for all the bills. Don't despair. This means you need practical, realistic help now. If you only need a short breather to get back on top of your cash, speak to your bank to see if they can give you a temporary overdraft for a month.

If you don't meet their criteria for credit, explain you're experiencing financial difficulties. Your bank has an obligation to do what it can to try to help not make the situation worse. They aren't going to write off everything you've spent, but they can give you a break on charges and interest until you're back on top of things. If your bank or credit provider refuses to help you, or makes the situation worse, make a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman for free.

If you need longer-term help, you meet the definition of financial difficulties. That's where the free debt charity StepChange can step in. I can't tell you how amazing StepChange is. They have helped millions of people tackle financial problems that seemed impossible to escape from.

StepChange will ask you for that budget information you've already prepared and will set up a tailored plan, working out what you can afford to pay each month. They then contact all your creditors on your behalf. Oh and don't ever go to a business that charges for this or for things like IVAs or bankruptcy - StepChange is totally free.

In this piece of great investigative journalism, we learned from interviewed experts that proposed technologies for characterizing the seafloor in support of understanding the feasibility of turbine anchoring/infrastructure have been/are employed by a multitude of organizations, with negligible impact to sea life. Onboard marine biologists will temporarily stop the survey if endangered species are observed. Biological surveys are planned for environmental impact studies along with identifying potential mitigating actions.

Yet the Morro Bay Group REACT is against the ocean surveys and plans to protest offshore wind at every step. REACT's leader indicated that they would consider taking money from the fossil fuel industry if it came down to a lawsuit. Really? REACT is open to taking money from an industry that has spread disinformation about climate change for decades and now admits to plans for unfettered oil and gas production going forward? That is extreme.

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for the excellent ""reality check"" article on the environmental impact of surveys conducted for proposed offshore wind (OSW) projects. Having worked for the city of Morro Bay, I know many of the folks in the REACT group and worked side-by-side with some of them to make Morro Bay the beautiful place that it is today. It saddens me to see them taking positions against OSW based on inaccurate information and, in turn, spreading that misinformation in the community.

I, too, have concerns about OSW and its impact on the local environment, but I try not to forget the bigger picture. Whales and other marine creatures are facing a present and growing threat from climate change fueled by the burning of fossil fuels. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt feeding grounds, alter migration patterns and harm vital ecosystems. As krill populations shift due to warming, whales struggle to find food, impacting their health and reproduction.

The transition to clean energy such as OSW is needed now and can be done responsibly. The future of the whales and the health of our planet depends on it!

""Morro Bay group claims offshore wind surveys kill marine life,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 13)

Thank you for your vital new ""reality check"" series and for including offshore wind development as the first topic of interest. We know that the climate crisis is largely caused by fossil fuels. As we work to preserve a livable world for future generations, we need to be well informed on the facts about sustainable energy sources, including one of the cleanest: wind energy. For constructive public discourse and sound decision-making to take place, we should inform ourselves with facts from trustworthy sources and data-driven research.

Your well researched articles clarify that the ocean surveys off the San Luis Obispo County coastline will be following safe, established practices. When it comes to our oceans, we should remember that it is climate change caused by using fossil fuels that is threatening marine life.

It is good news that many nations are adopting offshore wind as a major tool to transition to carbon free electricity. Just this month, America's first commercial scale offshore wind farm began delivering clean power to New York's electric grid. Later this year, another offshore wind farm will begin powering homes and businesses in Massachusetts. We need to be equally forward-looking in California.

""SLO readers opposed battery storage plant in Morro Bay,"" (sanluisobispo.com, Sept. 22, 2023)

Under Assembly Bill 205, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022, energy bills would take into account customers' incomes. People protested to the California Public Utilities Commission, asking them to either reject the proposal (partly because it would not reward customers who work hard to reduce energy usage) or provide guidance to the Legislature to change the law in a way that does not harm the middle class.

Reality Check: Is this law going to be implemented? Are rates going to be based on customers' incomes? Is that section taking effect? If so, when?

Another section of AB 205 applies to the permitting process of green energy projects, providing an expedited pathway for approval of projects that address climate change. The California Energy Commission could conceivably intervene and fast-track such a project.

Has this process been utilized by the CEC? How will this affect local control (such as in the case of the Morro Bay battery storage plant)?

""The Hur interview transcript offers a window into the life of 'frustrated architect' Joe Biden,"" (sanluisobispo.com, March 15)

Special Counsel Robert Hur is probably not qualified to assess cognitive function, and his report contains statements about President Joe Biden's mental state that are gratuitous and political.

That said, Hur is an experienced prosecutor who is qualified to assess how a prosecution would go in front of a jury -- which is what he did. He followed the facts and the law and concluded that Biden should not be prosecuted, noting the huge differences between this case and the classified documents case against Donald Trump.

While we may feel that statements in Hur's report about Biden's memory were political, we should celebrate the fact that the Biden White House allowed a Trump appointee to do his job without political interference -- a process which would not have happened under the prior administration.

This should also put to rest Republican claims that the Department of Justice has somehow been ""weaponized"" against Trump and his cronies.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",kenyastar.com,news,Kenya Star,,0.3098039215686275,448959549,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

Coal, often considered the dirtiest fossil fuel, is experiencing a resurgence despite global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. More than two years after climate negotiators attempted to phase out coal, the industry is proving remarkably resilient, fueled by a mix of factors including China's energy insecurity, rising Indian demand, the fallout from the Ukraine war, and challenges in international programmes to reduce fossil fuel reliance.

China's energy insecurity has pushed Beijing to rely more on trusted power sources, including coal, leading to a record-high output last year. Prices, while lower than the 2022 peak after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, remain high, with benchmark Newcastle coal futures trading at around $130 a tonne.

Asia, particularly China and India, will play a significant role in the coal resurgence, accounting for more than 70% of global coal consumption by 2026. These countries, along with Indonesia, are operating new coal power plants and have proposed additional ones, according to Global Energy Monitor.

Rob Bishop, CEO of Australian miner New Hope Corp, highlighted the continued demand for coal in Asia, indicating that coal will remain a significant energy source for the foreseeable future.

This extended reliance on coal is a vindication for fossil fuel executives, who have long argued against swiftly shifting away from carbon-intensive power, citing benefits in terms of reliability and cost. However, this trend is concerning for efforts to curb carbon emissions and reach global climate goals.

Despite expectations of coal production plateauing, recent events like power shortages in China and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have bolstered coal demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects coal output to stabilise through 2026, aligning with industry forecasts of a gradual decline.

In China, miners are struggling to maintain growth rates as low-cost reserves have been tapped, leading to the need for deeper and more expensive mines. However, the growth of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, is expected to exceed the growth in electricity consumption, providing a lifeline for coal as a reliable baseload option.

India is forecast to see growth in coal output this year, surpassing 1 billion metric tonnes for the first time, as the country aims to meet growing energy demand while reducing reliance on expensive imports.

Indonesia, the top thermal coal exporter, expects stable production for the next two years, driven by domestic demand from the nickel processing sector. However, accelerating the end of coal remains challenging in economies with newer plants, rising energy demand, and a need to create jobs.

Advancements in solar, wind, batteries, and energy storage systems are making renewable energy more affordable and could transform the energy mix in the future. However, the transition away from coal is expected to be gradual, testing previous expectations of a rapid decline in coal usage.

While coal's days are numbered, the world will need operators to mine coal and support the transition to renewable energy over many decades.

The government's five-year target, part of the National Housing Accord agreed to by the states and territories, begins mid-year.

BuildSkills Australia - a group tasked by the government to find solutions to the workforce challenges facing the construction industry - said that to stay on-track, the government would need to build 60,000 new homes each quarter, which would require a workforce of 90,000 people more than currently exists.

The group's executive director of research and planning, Robert Sobyra, said attracting that many workers in such a short time frame was impossible.

""Clearly next quarter we're not going to be able to achieve that 60,000 run rate, which means that in future quarters, we're going to have to deliver more to make-up for what we don't do at the front-end of the program,"" he said

Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said the analysis by BuildSkills aligned with what she was hearing from the industry.

""I'm concerned that there is no way known we can get 90,000 [workers] in three months, unless we had a radical change in the way upon which we are looking at our migration system, and our skill recognition system to support a fast-tracked migration solution,"" she said.

As well as boosting the number of migrants with trade skills, Ms Wawn said it also needed to be quicker, cheaper and less convoluted for overseas qualifications to be recognised.

""We're pushing constantly for trades to be on the skilled priority list - it's critical that we do that,"" she said.

But Ms Wawn said there also needed to be a push to attract more women to the sector, and encourage it as a viable career to school leavers, too.

""Only four per cent of apprentices at the moment are female, yet we complain in this country that we have gender pay-gap problems,"" Ms Wawn said.

But she remained optimistic the five-year target could still be achieved by 2029, and on time, because of how needed it is.

""The federal government should be commended that they've actually focused their attention around supply, not demand,"" she said.

""[But], we now need to focus on how we can actually get there.

""The issue really is: how do we actually encourage more people into our sector?""

Mr Sobyra agreed that while the analysis from BuildSkills put into focus ""how ambitious the target is,"" it was still possible.

""The level itself is not out of the realms of possibility, but getting up to that level as quickly as we need to, that's going to be the very difficult part,"" he said.

""So, we really need to be looking at every lever at our disposal to mobilise the workers that will be needed to achieve this objective.""

Housing Minister Julie Collins told Sky news it was an ambitious target, but the government was making progress.

""We know we've got a lot of work to do,"" she said.

""We're working right across government - I know the skills ministers had a meeting just over two weeks ago, where they talked about the skills required to meet the housing demand in Australia and the challenges we currently have.""",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,0.1843137254901961,448959212,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/585a09d513bc8c18c26dae159a508d11?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",theafricanews.net,news,The Africa News,,0.3098039215686275,448959010,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

The findings were part of the team from Cadent community Engagement officers based out of Bangor Street Community Centre.

The data was collected during 2023 and spanned 12 months where officers spoke to more than 750 residents by door knocking, at public fun day and charity events, Cadent Safety Awareness Sessions hosted at the centre and Warm Nights events.

Energy saving and issues relating to carbon monoxide safety were addressed as participants filled in household engagement forms.

The majority of those surveyed were in and around the Brookhouse and Bastwell wards but people from across town also featured as and when they attended wider events.

The survey found there was a high population density with larger families in homes, with 46 per cent of households having five or more people residing in homes, while 89 per cent used gas as the main source of heat.

The survey said 24 per cent were 'not aware' of the dangers of CO and 32 per cent were not aware of the signs to look out for over the dangers it could pose.

Of the symptoms nearly a third of those questions were not aware of the typical symptoms associated with CO poisoning.

Of the residents survived 80 per cent did have a smoke alarm but a third did not get their appliances checked.

There was also a lack of awareness when it came to energy saving, with 49 per cent 'not aware' or 'aware a little' over improving energy efficiency.

More than half of people surveyed were also 'not aware' or 'aware a little' over the grants and assistance available.

Ali Hussain who is helping to manage the project said: ""Some of the results were surprising.""

""It has been important for us to gather valuable insight into how much people are aware of these safety messages.

""The main focus was to reach to families and the elderly.

""Working alongside Cadent we are sharing safety advice on the dangers of carbon monoxide and energy saving and anyone can pop in anytime to speak to the team.

""People can fill in the household engagement form and if they are eligible they may qualify for a carbon monoxide alarm or other energy saving or home safety equipment.""

The survey found 53 per cent were not aware of the Priority Services Registrar.

The Priority Service Register (PSR) is a free support service for customers in vulnerable situations.

This is an industry wide register which supports energy companies to better look after customers who have additional communication, safety or access needs.

Ali added: ""It was surprising to realise that so many people did not this service existed.

""It is especially beneficial to the vulnerable and the elderly.""",lancashiretelegraph.co.uk,news,Lancashire Telegraph,Shuiab Khan,0.2313725490196079,448958922,1,https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/resources/images/17591427/,

This happens whether or not income growth puts taxable income into a higher marginal rate bracket.

Historically, governments of both stripes have allowed this mechanism to keep going until average rates - and marginal rates at average incomes - became so high that the burden became politically intolerable. This is when we finally get tax cuts.

One important test of such cuts is how much they do to offset past bracket creep.

On this issue, various claims were made about the Coalition government's three-stage personal income tax plan that began in 2018-19 and was to be completed this July.

The focus has always been on stage three; how it delivered a $9000 gain to high-income earners and allegedly over-compensated them for bracket creep.

This was despite stage one concentrating tax cuts on lower incomes, and high incomes not receiving significant relief from bracket creep since 2010-11.

Simple comparisons of average tax rates in 2024-25 with those in 2017-18 - just before the tax cut plan started - did reveal a reduction in average rates from around $90,000 compared with seven years ago.

However, such calculations fail to take into account the extra tax paid in each of those years as a result of bracket creep. Indeed, this failure of measurement applies at all income levels.

Using a more comprehensive methodology, CIS research has recalculated the cumulative effect of bracket creep and discretionary tax cuts over those seven years and found that even under the Coalition's original plan, the main beneficiaries of tax policy since 2017-18 have been those on incomes between $50,000 and $224,000.

Far from ""$9000 gifts to the rich"", those with incomes above $224,000 are slightly worse off over the period - and that's if they had received the original stage three tax cuts in full.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts

The Albanese government's re-design of stage three lowers the range of incomes that have been over-compensated for bracket creep to around $48,500-$214,000, and also delivers a cut to those on $34,000-$39,700 they would not otherwise have received.

However, if we look back further to 2010-11 - the year the last major tranche of tax cuts were fully implemented - the results are dramatically different.

The Coalition's three-stage plan undercompensates everyone above $35,000; while Labor's revision increases the extent of undercompensation above about $146,000 and slightly reduces it below that level.

The conclusion is that while any government is free to shape the distribution of a tax cut as it sees fit, relief from bracket creep is one important criterion, which provides no justification for the Albanese government's stage three renovations.

As a result, the bottoms of the 37 per cent and 45 per cent brackets ($135,000 and $190,000) will become pressure points sooner than otherwise.

Second, to the extent some taxpayers are being over-compensated for past bracket creep, future bracket creep will eventually devour that benefit.

The government's stage three tinkering might buy those taxpayers who benefit some more time, but not much.

Third, if thresholds were indexed to inflation annually, relatively small reductions to tax would be made each year thereby avoiding the accumulation of revenue to fund larger but illusory ""tax cuts"" every several years.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts - not merely the return of the additional money the government had taken in previous years.

And fourth, if indexation is not adopted in future (and there is no sign that it will be) there has to be a better understanding that under the practice of widely spaced discretionary tax cuts, larger absolute dollar cuts at higher incomes are necessary unless average tax rates are to increase inexorably above a certain income level.

Over time, that ""certain"" level will become lower in real terms, capturing an increasing number of taxpayers; with all that implies for the effect of the tax system on incentive and aspiration.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,-0.1843137254901961,448958849,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2856%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/339ac969c87b7c54a552aa731bba749a46922fda,eng-9411982

N.W.A, short for ""Niggaz Wit Attitudes,"" was formed in 1986 by a group of talented young rappers from Compton, California. Growing up in the inner city, they experienced the harsh realities of life and sought to express their frustrations and experiences through music.

The original lineup of N.W.A consisted of Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and DJ Yella. Each member brought their unique style and perspective, contributing to the group's dynamic sound and powerful lyrics.

In 1987, N.W.A released their first album, ""N.W.A and the Posse."" This album showcased their raw talent and unfiltered approach to addressing issues such as police brutality and gang violence. It was a departure from the dominant East Coast hip-hop sound at the time and marked the beginning of N.W.A's influence on the genre.

""We wanted to make music that represented our reality, the good and the bad. We wanted to bring our stories to the forefront and let the world hear what we had to say."" - Ice Cube

N.W.A's music resonated with their audience, as it shed light on the struggles and challenges faced by young African Americans in their communities. Their lyrics were a reflection of their experiences, providing a voice to those who were often unheard.

With their provocative lyrics and hard-hitting beats, N.W.A captivated listeners and challenged societal norms. They addressed topics that were considered taboo and brought attention to the social issues plaguing their neighborhoods.

N.W.A's First Album and the Emergence of Gangsta Rap

In 1988, N.W.A released their debut album, ""Straight Outta Compton."" This album was a game-changer for the music industry, introducing the world to gangsta rap, a subgenre that focused on the harsh realities of inner-city life. ""Straight Outta Compton"" was controversial due to its explicit lyrics and themes of violence and misogyny, but it went on to become a double-platinum success. This album solidified N.W.A's place in hip-hop history.

N.W.A's Message and Influence on Police Brutality and Racism in America

One of the most significant aspects of N.W.A's music was its commentary on police brutality and racism in America. Through their lyrics and powerful delivery, N.W.A addressed these deeply rooted societal issues, sparking a much-needed dialogue.

Tracks like ""Fuck tha Police"" boldly criticized law enforcement's mistreatment of African Americans, highlighting the urgent need for change. The powerful lyrics of this iconic song served as an anthem for those who had long suffered from unfair treatment at the hands of the police.

Another noteworthy song, ""Express Yourself,"" encouraged individuals to voice their thoughts and emotions freely. It emphasized the importance of self-expression and the need to break free from the oppressive constraints imposed by society.

By speaking out against police brutality and addressing the pervasive influence of racism in America, N.W.A became a catalyst for change. Their unapologetic stance resonated deeply with young African Americans who faced daily struggles and discrimination.

N.W.A's music not only shed light on these critical issues but also galvanized communities to take action against injustice. Their songs acted as a rallying cry, prompting individuals to question the status quo and demand accountability.

The influence of N.W.A's message reverberates even today, with their music continuing to inspire artists and activists. Their willingness to confront uncomfortable truths and challenge societal norms set a precedent for future generations to speak out against police brutality and racism.

The impact of N.W.A and their message on police brutality and racism in America cannot be underestimated. Years after their groundbreaking debut, their music remains relevant and serves as a testament to the power of art to drive social change.

Through their fearless expression, N.W.A sparked a conversation that continues today, providing a platform for marginalized voices and shedding light on the inequalities that persist.

N.W.A's Legacy and Continuing Impact

N.W.A's cultural impact on hip-hop and American culture is undeniably significant. Their music not only entertained but also shed light on the pressing issues faced by young African Americans, sparking a vital conversation about race, police brutality, and systemic racism.

Through their groundbreaking approach to music and uncompromising lyrics, N.W.A set the stage for a new era of hip-hop that challenged the status quo. Their influence can be seen in the countless hip-hop artists who followed in their footsteps, carrying on their legacy and pushing boundaries.

One such artist is Tupac Shakur, who was heavily influenced by N.W.A's unapologetic style and fearless storytelling. Tupac went on to become a legendary figure in hip-hop, using his platform to address social issues and advocate for change.

Kendrick Lamar, another artist inspired by N.W.A's impact, emerged as a leading voice in modern hip-hop. Known for his thought-provoking lyrics and introspective storytelling, Lamar continues to push the boundaries of the genre, carrying the torch that N.W.A ignited.

N.W.A's cultural impact on hip-hop and American culture is undeniable. This iconic group, comprised of Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, revolutionized the genre with their unapologetic message and raw lyrics. Through their music, they spoke directly to the experiences of young African Americans, shedding light on the challenges and injustices they faced in their communities.

N.W.A's fearless approach to addressing sensitive issues like police brutality and gang violence sparked a conversation about race and systemic racism in America. Songs such as ""Fuck tha Police"" and ""Express Yourself"" became anthems for a generation, inspiring new artists and activists to use their voices for social change.

Today, N.W.A's legacy lives on in the countless hip-hop artists who have been influenced by their groundbreaking sound and unapologetic approach. Artists like Tupac Shakur and Kendrick Lamar, among many others, have followed in their footsteps, using their music to challenge societal norms and shine a light on the realities of life for marginalized communities.

With their music and powerful message continuing to resonate with audiences, N.W.A's legacy will endure for many years to come. Their impact on hip-hop, American culture, and the fight against injustice cannot be overstated. N.W.A's influence remains a testament to the power of music in shaping society and inspiring change.

The places mentioned, and some others all over the island, have a history of controversy.

Besides the controversial history of how the land was purchased or gifted, they all are part of the Dubaisation of our country. They all offer glitz, shininess and the sickening taking over of space to accommodate international brands, the sameness of design seen all over the globe.

Aesthetically the edifices mostly look boring; even the slightly interesting ones feel ugly because of their context and the space they inhabit.

However, beyond all this groaning and the controversies behind them, few can deny that they are kept well. Maintained so well that some of them seem clinical. Most are good enough to let children, toddlers, adults of all ages, run free.

Their open spaces are car-free, well-organised and not the riot of horrors our roads have become. Most of our piazzas are filthy, taken over by vehicles which are a menace to all. Even the briskest of us must avoid all the obstacles that constantly confront us on our roads.

There is one locality which comes close to this well-kept dream. Birgu is, and has been, well looked after. The people living there seem to have more civic sense than most of the rest of the islanders. The mayor, who has held that position forever, is another secret to the success.

New Delhi: The Indian auto industry is gearing up to roll out an array of electric vehicle models over the next few years amid a renewed push by the government to encourage environment-friendly mobility solutions with the unveiling of a new policy. Mass market players like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors are lining up new models to cater to the demand across segments.

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30% of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20% of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around INR 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 % of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

""This will help accelerate the EV ecosystem in India,"" he stated.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.223529411764706,448958343,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108745398,imgsize-13244,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/passenger-vehicle/auto-players-line-up-array-of-new-ev-models-in-coming-years-on-govt-push-to-green-mobility.jpg",

Singapore: Emphasising the complex situation of dealing with a neighbour like Pakistan, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that Islamabad uses terrorism as an instrument of statecraft and does not even hide from the fact.

He affirmed that India will not skirt this problem anymore and the mood in the country is not to overlook the issue of terrorism.

The EAM, who is in Singapore as part of his three-nation visit, was speaking at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore on his book 'Why Bharat Matters'.

Speaking at the event, Jaishankar said, ""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...we have been unfortunate, or ill-starred to be blessed with the one we have to our west. How do you deal with a neighbour, who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""

Taking a veiled dig at Pakistan, the EAM said that in the country, terrorism exists almost at ""industry level"" and ""assembly line"".

""It's not a one-off, different countries at different points of time have experienced this. But, a very sustained, almost an industry level, assembly line...people whose job is to do bad things at night,"" he said.

Jaishankar added that India has decided that it will have to find a way to address the problem because dodging it will only invite more trouble.

""I don't have a quick, instantaneous fix, but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore...if we have a problem, we must be honest enough to face up to the problem. If you have to have those discussions, we should, if it's hard to find a solution, we must work through. We should not give the other country free pass...in India the mood is not to overlook terrorism,"" the EAM said.

""If you look at the changes that have happened in the last decade, the great deal of public anger to lack of response to terrorism threat is one factor,"" he added.

Jaishankar is on an official visit to Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia from March 23-27.

The visit will focus on enhancing bilateral relations with the three countries, and would provide an opportunity for engagement on regional issues of mutual concern, a Ministry of External Affairs release said earlier.

Gergely Fábián attended a European Commission working lunch in Brussels on the outlook of the bloc's steel industry together with the representatives of other member states, a dozen European companies and the head of the European Steel Association. The EC was represented by Maros Sefcovic, executive vice-president for European Green Deal, interinstitutional relations and foresight, and Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age and competition.

Speaking to MTI after the meeting, Fábián said keeping steel production in Europe and specifically central and eastern Europe alive and transitioning to carbon-neutral green steel production were strategic goals.

The state secretary said Hungary's increased industrial capacities also required steel.

The steel industry employs tens of thousands of people in central and eastern Europe, Fábián said, and cited the head of the European Steel Association as saying that every direct steel industry job adds seven more indirect jobs on the industry value chain.

The state secretary said that after Friday's meeting it had become clear to the EC as well that more resources were needed to make the steel industry greener, and that these programmes needed to be streamlined so that they are easier for stakeholders to access.

Fábián said there were multiple types of EU resources that could be used to support the green transition, such as the modernisation and innovation funds.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.4274509803921569,448958143,18,https://dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EU-steel-industry.jpg,eng-9413077

At least 1,000 residents across Kiikuuta Village in Kakabara Sub-county, Kyegegwa District, are celebrating after finally getting a clean and protected water source for the first time in 90 years.

The residents, who have inhabited the area since before the country's 1962 independence, said ""for generations, they have relied on water collected from runoffs along the roadside or endured over 15km-journeys to reach the Nyakabiso River.""

Over the last near-century, residents have endured the burden of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea and typhoid due to the lack of access to safe water, according to local authorities.

Sixty-year-old Kikuuta Village resident Joseph Bareekye told Monitor that ""majority of his village mates lived and died without ever accessing safe water.""

""All that we use for our domestic needs is contaminated water. Those who can afford use boda-bodas or bicycles to fetch water from nearby streams for Shs1,000 per jerrycan. For those of us who can't afford it, we resort to either sharing water with animals or relying solely on rainwater,"" he remarked on Saturday.

Now, residents like Wilbroad Rubaramira say they are optimistic ""they will no longer have to spend money on treatment, as a new clean water source promises to improve their health and well-being.""

""I have told my people that we must protect it to see that it can serve us for more than 20 years, leaders have ignored us for years,"" he reacted a day after a new borehole was commissioned in the area on Friday.

Authorities say the Shs6.6 million clean water project was enabled by MTN Foundation Uganda under the Change Makers program in partnership with Soul Rescue Mission.

Kyegegwa District assistant water officer Sarah Nakachwa decried little government funding.

""The district receives little funding and cannot extend water to all villages. We have a window for all development partners to come to work with the district,"" she said.

She added: ""Also, our plan for next year's financial year is to construct one water source point in this area. We are now looking for a place where we can establish it.""

Facts

According to data from the Ministry of Water and Environment, the overall access to safe water in Kyegegwa District is at 30 per cent, with rural areas at 29 per cent and urban areas at 48 per cent.

The district currently has 661 domestic water points, serving a significant portion of the population in rural areas. However, a concerning statistic reveals that a total of 131 water points have been non-functional for over 5 years and are considered abandoned.

In terms of specific sub-counties, access to safe water varies: Hapuuyo sub-county stands at 55 percent, Kabweeza-Kyegegwa at 31 per cent, Kakabara at 27 per cent, Kasule at 36 per cent, Kyegegwa Town Council at 48 per cent, Mpara at 33 per cent, Rwentuha at 21 per cent, and Ruyonza at 20 per cent.",monitor.co.ug,news,Daily Monitor,Alex Ashaba,-0.01960784313725494,448958136,1,https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/4566774/52d53d498c5c9a5a230d59a4c825509e/latest02pix-data.jpg,eng-9412856

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",nigeriasun.com,news,Nigeria Sun,,0.3098039215686275,448958113,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

Jalen Green erupted for a game-high 41 points at Toyota Center as the Jazz held no chance against a fiery Rockets team. He was just one point shy of his season-high as Fred VanVleet joined him to take their team on a runaway win.

Talking to Houston's sideline reporter Vannessa Richardson, Green talks about what helped them get them going. ""It's defense. That's the main part...Offense, not even; that's the last thing we worried about. So it's really good defense and just really being aggressive and staying together.""

It was a game of season highs and records for the Rockets. VanVleet tied the franchise record for three-pointers, knocking down 10 from downtown. He further tallied a season-high 34 points while dishing out seven assists, and grabbing three rebounds. The veteran guard and Green came together for 75 of the total points. Aside from VanVleet, Jeff Green also posted a season-high 21 points off the bench.

The Jazz was without Lauri Markkanen and Jordan Clarkson, but they started strong, only for Houston to take off with a 20-3 run that resulted in a 40-19 lead. And unsurprisingly, Jalen and Fred shone during the breakout. The two of them combined for 16 points with Green hitting a jumper, a trey, and an alley-oop dunk. As for VanVleet, the point guard hit three triples in that time.

With that, the Rockets finished the first quarter 47-21, just one point shy of the Pelicans for the highest first-quarter points this season.

Jalen Green joins Rockets' veterans in solidifying run

In his third season now, Jalen Green is averaging 19.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game on 54.4% true shooting in 2023-24. The Rockets entered this season with serious goals for their team. And it was obvious with the addition of veterans like VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks and the hiring of hard-nosed coach, Ime Udoka.

With Houston preparing to build a contending team around Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun's breakout was a welcome surprise. But with the center encountering multiple injuries, Green has assumed the role quite well.

The 22-year-old is averaging 34.4 points and 7.4 rebounds per game while shooting 56.5% from the field and 50.0% from beyond the arc. As Green mentioned to Richardson, his veteran teammates' advice was to just keep shooting when he got hot. But he also credited his recent surge to his soon-to-be-born baby girl and family.

Whatever Jalen's motivation is, it has given a hope for a playoff berth. The Rockets are just 1.5 games behind the Warriors for the 10th position. Though a long run to the top, continued momentum might keep the Rockets' hopes alive.",essentiallysports.com,news,EssentiallySports,,0.1372549019607843,448958073,1,https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-03-24T004945Z_1013393463_MT1USATODAY22849557_RTRMADP_3_NBA-UTAH-JAZZ-AT-HOUSTON-ROCKETS-472x315.jpg?class=watermark,eng-9421057

According to reports from January 2024, 4.9 million demat accounts were opened in December of 2023 itself, with the year ending at a total tally of 139 million. This boom can be attributed to many aspects, such as an increase in overall income and a greater interest in the stock market. However, this influx of investors requires brokers to keep one very important factor in mind: transparency.

The evolving financial landscape demands that we as brokers ensure the well-being and interests of our clients. People and outlets have already labelled the money we handle for our clients as ""A cheap and easy source of funding"", a sentiment that may seem harmless but can impact client trust. Transparency is the cornerstone of any financial transaction.

Investors need to have peace of mind knowing their money is safe and the information they are provided with is accurate. A World Economic Forum report states transparency not only fosters trust but also greatly affects market efficiency and stability.

I find transparency to be key when it comes to fee structures. Hidden charges and complex fee breakdowns can almost instantly turn away a potential client and erode existing investor confidence. SEBI has previously instructed all brokers to disclose the most important terms to investors, as a majority would not be aware of the various fees associated with the broking service.

We should also go one step beyond the fees and disclose any potential conflicts of interest to investors. Factors such as commissions or third-party partnerships can be beneficial to the broker but should not supersede the responsibility a broker has to their investor. Proactively disclosing such information may end in some clients walking away, but the transparency will encourage others to stick around for much longer.

Transparency should permeate every aspect of the broking industry, including the execution of trades. Technological advances such as algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading are now raising doubts in the minds of investors regarding market integrity.

A study conducted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange found that higher levels of transparency resulted in increased trading activity in Shanghai stocks. This sentiment can be applied to every stock market in the world; the better people understand how trades function and operate, the more likely they are to trade. Providing clients with real-time information on trade executions can significantly enhance trust in market integrity.

Risk and reward are two sides of the same coin in investing, but both sides must be shown to the investor. So, risk management frameworks within brokerage firms are essential to ensure peace of mind for clients. Risk management frameworks enable investors to understand protocols and procedures brokers have implemented to safeguard their funds. These frameworks can include both technological and manual failsafes to ensure investor interest protection is of paramount importance.

Regulatory authorities play a great role when it comes to instilling transparency within broking. I've already mentioned how SEBI is always revising policies to safeguard investor interest. But it also falls on us brokers to ensure we play by the rules. By promoting fair and transparent trading practices and constructing effective risk management systems while disclosing every conflict of interest or risk, we create an even and welcoming playing field that will entice investors.

To sum it up, transparency is not just a buzzword; it requires active and consistent work to put into practice. Prioritizing transparency is the key to ensuring investors are not alienated or pushed away from the investing space. Not only will this benefit the investor, but it has a ripple effect on the entire economy. More investors mean more money flowing, which results in a stronger economy and more opportunities for brokers. Transparency might seem like a risk to some, but it is a net good we should inculcate.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.3490196078431373,448958009,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108745313,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-34152,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

'He shaped our history. He got the big things right,' Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. 'He had a huge impact.'

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

'To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,' McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers - Jean Chretien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

The immediate family of Brian Mulroney look on as RCMP pallbearers carry the casket to the funeral of the former prime minister, in Montreal, March 23, 2024.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

'Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,' Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. 'He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.'

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

'Brian Mulroney chose to spend his political capital. He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,' former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",northernirelandnews.com,news,Northern Ireland News,,0.3098039215686275,448957903,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260402.jpg,

Mass market players like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors are lining up new models to cater to the demand across segments.

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

In legal realms, the term ""collateral sources"" emerges frequently in discussions concerning damage compensation. Despite its apparent intricacy, grasping collateral sources is pivotal for adeptly maneuvering through legal procedures. This article aims to demystify collateral sources, delving into their essence, significance, and ramifications on legal adjudications.

Collateral sources denote funds or benefits received by an injured party from entities other than the defendant in a legal case. These encompass insurance payouts, governmental aids, employer-backed benefits, and philanthropic contributions. The salient feature of collateral sources lies in their capacity to furnish financial relief to the injured party sans diminishing the defendant's liability for damages.

Instances of Collateral Sources

Collateral sources encompass an array of benefits and disbursements that can influence the financial landscape of the injured party. Instances encompass health insurance reimbursements for medical expenditures, governmental disability benefits, workers' compensation aids, and disbursements from private insurance policies such as life or disability coverage. Additionally, charitable aids like donations or grants earmarked for medical expenses or sustenance are deemed collateral sources.

The Pertinence of Collateral Sources in Legal Milieus

Impact on Damages Awarded

In legal litigations concerning personal injury or wrongful demise, the presence of collateral sources exerts a palpable influence on the damages awarded to the aggrieved party or their survivors. Courts may factor in collateral sources when quantifying the damages owed by the defendant, given their potential to alleviate the financial strain borne by the injured party. However, the magnitude of collateral source impact on damages awards varies contingent on state statutes and judicial precedents.

Subrogation and Reimbursement Dynamics

Another salient facet of collateral sources pertains to subrogation and reimbursement dynamics. In instances where the injured party garners recompense from collateral sources like health insurance or workers' compensation, these entities may assert the prerogative to seek reimbursement from any damages awarded in a legal settlement or decree. This procedural underpinning, dubbed subrogation, empowers collateral sources to recoup the funds disbursed on behalf of the injured party.

The treatment of collateral sources in legal arenas undergoes pronounced variation contingent on state statutes and judicial precedents. Some jurisdictions espouse statutes or court doctrines permitting the deduction of collateral source disbursements from damages awards, whereas others restrict or proscribe such deductions. Grasping the legal milieu encompassing collateral sources within a specific jurisdiction assumes pivotal importance in effectively advocating for the rights of injured parties.

Hurdles in Presenting Collateral Sources

Presenting collateral sources in legal proceedings poses challenges for both plaintiffs and defendants alike. Plaintiffs may encounter hurdles in procuring and divulging information pertaining to collateral sources, particularly if they possess limited knowledge of their entitlements or if the sources evince reluctance to cooperate. Similarly, defendants confront challenges in accurately gauging the impact of collateral sources on damages awards and adeptly presenting this information before judicial fora.

Strategies for Mitigating Collateral Source Challenges

Thorough Documentation and Disclosure

In navigating the complexities surrounding collateral sources, meticulous documentation and transparent disclosure assume paramount importance. Plaintiffs must diligently gather and organize evidence pertaining to collateral sources, ensuring comprehensive disclosure to all relevant parties. Conversely, defendants should adopt a proactive approach in scrutinizing the veracity and relevance of disclosed collateral sources, leveraging legal mechanisms to challenge any discrepancies or inaccuracies.

Strategic Negotiation and Advocacy

Effective negotiation and advocacy are instrumental in navigating the intricacies of collateral source dynamics. Plaintiffs' attorneys should adeptly leverage the knowledge of collateral sources to bolster their clients' claims, articulating compelling arguments that underscore the necessity and legitimacy of compensation. Conversely, defense counsel should employ strategic tactics to scrutinize and challenge collateral source assertions, ensuring equitable adjudication of damages.

The Evolving Landscape of Collateral Source Law

Legislative Reforms and Judicial Precedents

The legal landscape governing collateral sources continues to evolve, with legislative reforms and judicial precedents shaping the contours of applicable law. Legal practitioners must remain vigilant to emerging trends and developments in collateral source jurisprudence, adapting their strategies and advocacy techniques accordingly. By staying abreast of evolving legal standards, attorneys can effectively navigate the complexities of collateral source litigation and secure favorable outcomes for their clients.

Advocacy for Reform and Clarity

Given the complexities and inconsistencies inherent in collateral source law, advocacy for reform and clarity is warranted. Legal professionals, advocacy organizations, and policymakers should collaborate to streamline collateral source rules, enhance transparency, and promote fairness in damages compensation. By advocating for legislative reforms and judicial clarity, stakeholders can contribute to a more equitable and efficient legal framework for addressing collateral source issues.

Conclusion

The Collateral source rule represents a nuanced and consequential aspect of damages compensation in legal proceedings. By understanding the intricacies of collateral source dynamics, legal practitioners can effectively advocate for their client's rights and navigate the complexities of collateral source litigation. Through strategic negotiation, diligent documentation, and advocacy for legal reforms, stakeholders can foster fairness and transparency in collateral source adjudication, ultimately contributing to more equitable outcomes in legal disputes.",goodmenproject.com,news,The Good Men Project,,0.1294117647058823,448957648,1,https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iStock-1453037517.jpg,

At Cherokee Nation, we have a long history of supporting farmers and ranchers. From distributing relief payments to farm and food workers during the worst of the pandemic to filling market gaps for ranchers through the 1839 Cherokee Meat Co., we know how important it is to prioritize the people who grow, raise and process the food on our tables.

At the same time, Cherokee values tell us we have a duty to protect the land and waters that bring life to the whole community. Farmers, large and small, join in that responsibility to be good neighbors and not to pollute our shared resources. That's why Oklahoma law includes a common-sense prohibition against discharging large amounts of poultry waste into the waters of the state.

Never miss Indian Country's biggest stories and breaking news. Click here to sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.

It is disturbing to see a push by Oklahoma lawmakers to undo that protection. I recently joined with the leaders of the Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole nations to speak out against House Bill 4118, which, if passed into law, would severely threaten Oklahoma's water. The bill would remove the prohibition on discharging waste, shield polluters from all liability, and replace these protections with vague rules to be developed by a relatively small state agency that does not have the capacity to monitor poultry farms across the state.

Not so long ago, we saw what happens when this waste is allowed to go unchecked. The pollution led to algae blooms that clouded the water, killed numerous fish, endangered drinking water, and threatened recreational areas. Lake Tenkiller, just south of the Cherokee Nation's capital in Tahlequah, was one of the worst affected bodies of water, and the damage extended to many other waterways. That's why a federal judge ruled against the handful of large companies controlling the poultry industry in a lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma attorney general in 2005.

HB 4118 would take all of the teeth out of that ruling and remove other safeguards against pollution. In its current form, this legislation poses a serious threat to the environment and water quality on the Cherokee Nation Reservation. It also undermines the ability of property owners, including thousands of Cherokees and our neighbors across northeast Oklahoma, to protect their land and water from pollution by poultry waste.

Our commitment to preserving our environment is unwavering, and this bill threatens this precious resource for future generations. In effect, HB 4118 would allow the industry to regulate itself and just hope that every farmer and poultry corporation does the right thing, with little to no recourse by the state or local communities if they violate that trust.

Cherokee Nation proudly supports farmers and other agricultural producers, but we cannot support a bill that would grant immunity to polluters, threaten our water, and harm communities and recreational areas across the Reservation. For all of these reasons, I am urging state lawmakers to not allow HB 4118 to advance any further.

New Delhi: The Indian auto industry is gearing up to roll out an array of electric vehicle models over the next few years amid a renewed push by the government to encourage environment-friendly mobility solutions with the unveiling of a new policy. Mass market players like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors are lining up new models to cater to the demand across segments.

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

The task force's members, including Florida Republican Kat Cammack, have already had a few organizational meetings and met with AI leaders to discuss, among other topics, November's election.

""This is a critical issue that is going to really have an impact in every aspect of our lives, from here moving forward into the future,"" Cammack told Fox News Digital.

""I think [members are] pretty much on the same page as far as we recognize both the challenges but also the opportunities that come with AI. ... Folks on the task force have a very pragmatic, forward-thinking, optimistic view of AI. But we are not blind to the fact that there are challenges""

AI image tools generate election disinformation 41% of the time, and AI tools generate images promoting voting disinformation 59% of the time, according to a recent report published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Cammack says the task force is ""looking [to identify] some of the challenges that people are opening with AI-generated content, disclaimers [about] what that will mean in terms of deepfakes, how do we authenticate and watermark AI-generated content, images, videos, etc.""

The Center for Countering Digital Hate report found examples of image disinformation, such as a photo of President Biden sick in a hospital bed and a photo of former President Trump sitting in a jail cell.

Tech giant Meta requires paid users to disclose when potentially misleading AI-generated or altered content is featured in political, electoral or social issue ads.

""You'll have all these discussions about [how content] should be watermarked. ... We've already seen where AI can take off a watermark on an AI-generated product. That's just a Band-Aid,"" Cammack said. ""We need to get to the root solution and establish a protocol in place that will prevent mass confusion.""

Cammack says she and her team are working on a framework that would allow for a blockchain authentication model to exist.

""I see blockchain as a future mechanism to help authenticate material, and that will be really important for candidates and for legislators in such a rapid environment. Having your photos, your videos, all of your content authenticated with a very secure technology like blockchain, that will be very, very important,"" she said.

The Florida Republican said the task force should be wary of the overregulation of artificial intelligence, saying her focus will be to protect access in the marketplace for some of the smaller players and ensure there is no bias.

""The worst thing government can do is stamp out innovation through overregulation. My hope is to really address some of the language model challenges on the front end to make sure that we're weeding out bias. We're not inherently pushing answers to fit a political agenda,"" she said.

But now, they're adding another crucial element to their identity: sustainability. While climate change headlines paint a grim picture, millennials are increasingly choosing action over anxiety. We're embracing a greener future, and that includes the energy powering our lives. But between navigating careers, relationships, and a rapidly changing world, where does one even begin with green energy?

Why Go Green?

Let's be honest, climate change isn't exactly ""trending."" But beyond the headlines, it's about building a healthy planet for us and future generations. And guess what? Green energy isn't just good for the Earth; it's good for your wallet. Renewable sources like solar and wind are becoming increasingly affordable, and the government even offers incentives for adopting them.

Beyond Buzzwords

So, you're on board with the green idea, but the technical terms can sound like another language. Let's break it down:

Renewable energy: Energy sources that naturally replenish, like solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower. Think sunbeams powering your phone.

Sustainable energy: Meeting our energy needs without compromising the planet's ability to meet future needs. Think efficiency and responsible consumption, not just switching sources.

Carbon footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gases our activities generate. Reducing this is key to combating climate change. Think of leaving a lighter footprint, literally and figuratively.

Empowering Your Choices: Practical Steps for a Greener Lifestyle

Knowledge is power, so here are some actionable steps to incorporate green energy into your life:

Switch to a green energy provider: Choose energy providers committed to renewable sources. Research options and make the switch! Invest in energy efficiency: Invest in energy-efficient appliances with Energy Star labels. Your wallet and the planet will thank you.

Explore solar power: Consider installing solar panels on your home or supporting community solar projects. Rooftop sunlight can become your power plant. Reduce your energy consumption: Every watt counts! Unplug unused electronics, embrace natural light, and air-dry dishes when possible. Small actions have a big impact.

Be a green influencer: Knowledge is power. Share your green energy journey with friends and family, inspiring them to join the movement.

The Role of Technology

Technology plays a pivotal role in the green energy revolution, and millennials are at the forefront of technological

innovation. From blockchain-enabled energy trading platforms to smart grid technologies, millennials are leveraging digital tools to optimize energy efficiency and promote renewable energy adoption. Apps and online platforms provide millennials with information and resources to make informed choices about their energy consumption and support sustainable practices.

Educating and Empowering Future Generations: Millennials recognize the importance of education in fostering a culture of sustainability. They are actively involved in initiatives to educate young people about renewable energy and environmental conservation. Through school programs, workshops, and community outreach events, millennials are empowering future generations to embrace green energy solutions and become stewards of the planet.

Remember, going green is a marathon, not a sprint. Start small, celebrate your progress, and be part of the generation that powers a sustainable future. By embracing green energy solutions, we can collectively create a brighter tomorrow, not just for ourselves but for the planet we call home.",thehansindia.com,news,The Hans India,,0.1372549019607843,448957142,1,https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/03/24/1433100-bags.jpg,eng-9415511

Having won 58-4 in Super League in the capital last weekend, The Wire's 42-0 victory at The Halliwell Jones Stadium took them to exactly 100 points scored across the two fixtures.

It allowed them to book their spot in the quarter-final draw, which takes place on Monday evening.

Our Wire reporter Matt Turner picked out five key talking points from the game here...

There may not have been any Challenge Cup shocks this weekend, but a few of the big boys made heavy weather of ties many considered straightforward.

That was particularly true of Wigan Warriors, who were given quite a fright by Sheffield Eagles before eventually pulling away on Friday night.

With that in mind, it was pleasing to see Warrington Wolves avoid falling into the trap by delivering an efficient and professional performance.

The result was never in doubt quite literally from the first minute onwards, with the very first set of the game leading to Josh Thewlis' opening try and from that point, it was a case of how many Wire would score.

London were definitely much improved on what they showed six days prior in the capital, but Warrington showed up with the right attitude.

Big tick for the defence

Wire piled on the points once again but as Sam Burgess himself said post-match, perhaps the most pleasing part was the zero they conceded.

They had to ride their luck at times, particularly in the second half when Matt Dufty was beaten in the air by Alex Walker only for the London full-back to loose grip of the ball in the in-goal.

They also had to scramble, the best example of that being Matty Ashton somehow holding Gideon Boafo up over the line with the score at 6-0.

Defensively, they were tested much more than they had been the previous week but they were aggressive, organised and connected both in the middle and on the edges.

Greater tests are to come but structurally at least, Burgess will be pleased with what he saw off the ball.

Try Tai-me

Wire fans finally got a look at their new centre, and they will have been pleased with what they saw.

Rodrick Tai may still be well short of full fitness but the Papua New Guinean still produced an encouraging display on both sides of the ball.

In marking the occasion with a try, he demonstrated the pace and power that was promised when his signature was confirmed while it was his deft tip-on which opened up the London defence for Thewlis to send Matty Nicholson over late on.

Defensively, he did his job with a highlight reel hit thrown in there too.

He will no doubt get better in time, but this was a promising first outing for the 25-year-old.

Philbin's big stint

One point of pre-match deliberation was whether or not Burgess may opt to leave his interchange middles out for longer spells.

That proved to be the case, with Zane Musgrove and particularly Joe Philbin spending a hefty amount of time on the field.

Having started on the edge, Nicholson's introduction moved Philbin back to the middle and he produced an impactful stint that did not end until the very late stages of the game.

Musgrove too get plenty of time under his belt and considering Joe Bullock was deemed too ill to come on, leaving them an interchange down, Burgess will be happy with how his rotation worked.

There was no need to flog James Harrison and Paul Vaughan after their opening stints, with both only returning briefly late on, so that ever-crucial starting middle should be fresh for what is to come.

Now the fun begins...

Have we learned much about Warrington Wolves as an on-field unit over the past couple of weeks?

Probably not - anything other than two convincing wins over London would have been considered a disappointment and that is what they delivered, but the mentality and attitude shown in both matches lends weight to the idea that the dressing room culture may really be changing.

Now, though, the tests go up a notch with Catalans Dragons - the only team to blot their copybook thus far - arriving in a week for what should be a keenly contested affair.

As platforms like Facebook witness a surge in the circulation of AI-created images, concerns about misinformation and susceptibility among older demographics have come to the forefront.

With AI algorithms like DALL-E and Midjourney now accessible to the public, the digital landscape is inundated with images that blur the line between reality and fabrication. From seemingly ordinary scenes with surreal elements to uncannily realistic faces that never existed, the proliferation of AI art has reshaped the way we perceive visual content online.

Understanding the perception gap

While younger users often exhibit a discerning eye when encountering AI-generated content, older demographics, particularly Generation X and beyond, seem more susceptible to its deceptive allure. Research suggests that this divergence in perception stems not from cognitive decline but from a lack of familiarity and experience with AI technology.

According to a study conducted by AARP and NORC, only a fraction of adults aged 50 and above reported being well-versed in AI, indicating a significant gap in awareness compared to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, experiments examining participants' reactions to AI-generated images have revealed a tendency among older individuals to attribute them to human creators, highlighting the need for increased education and awareness in this demographic.

Navigating the digital terrain: A call for awareness and regulation

As the prevalence of AI-generated content continues to grow, so do concerns surrounding its potential for exploitation and misinformation, particularly among older users. While older adults may possess a wealth of knowledge and critical thinking skills, they remain vulnerable to sophisticated scams and deceptive practices facilitated by AI technology.

To address these challenges, experts advocate for increased awareness and education initiatives aimed at helping older individuals discern between genuine and AI-generated content. Additionally, calls for regulation and corporate accountability have gained traction, with lawmakers introducing legislation to mitigate the risks posed by deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media.

In the face of an evolving digital landscape, individuals and policymakers are responsible for safeguarding against the proliferation of AI-generated content and its potential impact on society at large. By fostering a culture of critical thinking and equipping users with the tools to navigate the digital terrain responsibly, we can mitigate the risks posed by deceptive AI creations and ensure a safer online environment for all.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1607843137254903,448956918,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character Bullwinkle made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Standing 1.8 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 453.5 kilograms, moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 20 Celsius.

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 805 kilometers from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s, but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,Associated Press,0.05098039215686279,448956661,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-53e2-08dc4bb9c706_cx0_cy10_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg,

The proposals also include almost 35,000 sq m of business space.

Developers Quadrant initially wanted to put 600 homes on Eureka Business Park in Kennington site for its Trinity Lakes estate but scaled it back to 375. The 128-acre site is between Trinity Road and Sandyhurst Lane.

The land is earmarked for housing and commercial space in Ashford Borough Council's (ABC) Local Plan. At a meeting of ABC's planning committee on March 13, councillors met to decide on the bid.

A planning officer explained to members that as an ""outline"" planning application, it gives consent for up to 375 homes, with the exact details of layout and design to be decided later. ""Importantly, the development is able to deliver nutrient neutrality,"" the officer said.

Problems with nutrient levels in the Stodmarsh Nature Reserve have held up the building of thousands of homes in east Kent - with developers not allowed to proceed until they or the government propose ways of mitigating nutrient levels.

The officer continued to say that the mitigation ""includes taking 8.2 hectares of existing arable land out of agricultural production, and that will be set aside as lightly managed grassland to maintain a natural, rural environment"".

Patrick Reedman, director at DHA planning and an agent for the developers, attended the meeting to speak in favour of the plans. The estate will be a ""relatively low density, spacious and very nice living environment,"" he said.

He added: ""We are in the midst of a housing crisis and in this case housing delivery in the borough means that the presumption does apply."" This refers to the ""presumption"" in favour of development - which councils are put into if they consistently fail to deliver enough housing.

Mr Reedman continued: ""This means prioritising housing on sites like this. The application presents you with an opportunity to deliver a nutrient-mitigated, policy-compliant level of housing, affordable housing, and employment, which can be approved now.""

It is proposed that 30% of the homes - or 113 - are to be affordable. The development has been controversial, however, with 74 residents writing letters of objection to ABC's planning department.

Doreen Titmuss, of Boughton Aluph & Eastwell Parish Council, attended the meeting to speak against the project. She said: ""This application represents the largest development expected within the parish over the next decade.

""Development at this scale does not come without impact - there are still concerns over the volume of traffic which may be generated. Rest assured the parish council will be closely monitoring the increases in traffic and any additional congestion.""

Cllr Charles Ellish, of Kennington Community Council, also criticised the plans at the meeting, saying: ""We believe it will not produce a net benefit to the residents of Kennington. This site does not appear to be designed with the needs of Kennington in mind beyond national housing targets.""

The maximum height for buildings on the estate is set at 14 metres, but an officer assured members that only the commercial buildings would reach this height. A Kent County Council highways officer also explained to members that ""the developer will be providing a half-hourly bus service and we have secured funding for it for at least a seven-year period"".

Cllr Ken Mulholland (Con) told the committee: ""I welcome this development. It's quite adventurous in many ways and it's certainly going to help with the housing numbers.""

Another planning officer told members that because of the nutrient neutrality measures ""there's a good chance this site can be brought forward in a reasonable timeframe"". He continued: ""This is potentially one of our flagship sites in the town. It's one of our largest local plan allocations and the ability to bring it forward for a good and high quality of development is really important for the status of the town in my view.""

ABC's planning committee voted unanimously, with 11 votes in favour to grant outline planning permission for the development.

Jaishankar spoke about how machines for the manufacture of semiconductors have started coming (to India) and also how India is progressing towards establishing the first three plants for this multi-billion dollar industry.

""There is a degree of purpose and seriousness as well as investment going into manufacturing that has not been seen for a long time,"" the Minister told a 300-plus audience, mostly Singapore-based members of the business community.

He was answering questions at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of the National University of Singapore (NUS) after a lecture on his book 'Why Bharat Matters.'

""A very productive interaction with leading Singaporean Corporate figures. ... Appreciate their positive feedback on the India growth story, based on investment experiences. ... Confident that their commitment to doing more business in India will further increase,"" Jaishankar later posted on X along with some photos from the event.

Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore and reached here earlier in the day, highlighted ""a very good global manufacturing response to the Production Linked Initiative (PLI) Scheme,"" but at the same time reminded the audience that India had missed the manufacturing bus in the previous decades.

Semiconductors are an essential component in almost everything, from electronic gadgets to consumer goods and from solar panels, satellites to weapons. Currently, India imports almost 90 per cent of its requirements of semiconductors.

Combining the two primary focus areas, the 'Digital India' and 'Make In India,' the Modi government has launched 'India Semiconductor Mission' as a specialised and independent business division to enable India's emergence as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design.

Jaishankar told the investor audience about three semiconductor plants being set up in India and said, ""We have started to get machinery for semiconductors today to start to build in India.""

The manufacturing message is being taken across the country, and clearly with better logistics and better talent, he pointed out.

Jaishankar also informed the guests that the government of India has entered into agreements with the country's universities for training by modernising and tweaking engineering courses in a way in which the resources for the semiconductor industry would start to flow.

""Right now, we are actually looking at a plan which would give us in the coming years at least 85,000 new people for jobs in the semiconductor zone .... it is something which we expect to grow.""

Jaishankar elaborated on the decade spent on building a foundation and goals set for achieving target-driven economic growth saying India has set 25-year goals for itself.

""That is something which is happening, the 2030 goal, and there's a 2040 goal. And there's a 2047 goal,"" said Jaishankar, calling on people to get more invested in all these changes happening (as development progresses within these goals), and urged people to start preparing themselves for what is to come.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.1372549019607843,448956493,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108744927,imgsize-10656,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/auto-technology/jaishankar-urges-singapores-business-community-to-invest-in-indias-semiconductor-manufacturing-sector.jpg",

The NASA-led analysis is based on more than 30 years of satellite observations, with the initial satellite launching in 1992 and the latest in 2020.

Overall, sea levels have risen by around four inches since 1993. The rate of increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches per year in 1993, to the current rate of 0.17 inches per year.

""Current rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050,"" said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.

That would be double the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous century, she said, creating a future where flooding is far more frequent and catastrophic than today.

The immediate cause of the spike is the El Niño weather effect, which replaced the La Niña from 2021 to 2022, when the sea level rose around 0.08 inches.

El Niño involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific.

""In El Niño years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily,"" said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

But there is also a clear human footprint evident in the underlying trend of acceleration.

""Long-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Niño, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,"" said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA's sea level change team at JPL.

Technological innovations have brought greater accuracy of measurements over the years. For example, radar altimeters bounce microwaves off the sea surface, then record the time the signal takes to travel back to the satellite, as well as the strength of the return signal.

They also cross-check their data with other sources like tide gauges and satellite measurements of atmospheric water vapor and Earth's gravity field.",manilastandard.net,news,Manila Standard,,0.2156862745098038,448956359,1,https://cdn.manilastandard.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cracked_dry.jpg,eng-9415213

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

""These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,"" he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next seven to eight years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around ₹26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

The world is at a pivotal moment as the ship of global climate action finally turns to face in the right direction. Armed with its 2024 climate action plan, the Government has declared that it wants Ireland to be a leader in navigating the stormy waters that lie immediately ahead.

That determination could become undone by a planet destabilised due to human-caused climate change, with ever-rising global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse gas levels not seen for two million years. Yet the availability of known solutions has reached critical mass, suggesting doomspeak should be parked and we should get on with their deployment.

Crucial questions arise: Will we act fast enough to avoid our unsustainability pushing us to extinction? Is Ireland's climate plan ambitious enough to transform its economy within decades? Are we adequately prepared for rapidly growing climate risks? We can be the first generation to achieve a sustainable world - but are Irish people sufficiently equipped to do so?

Known as CAP24, Ireland's Climate Action Plan is a roadmap for halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2050; a climate playbook with hundreds of time-bound actions. It is out for public consultation, with the Cabinet due to sign off on it in weeks. It coincides with unprecedented public support for ramping up responses to the climate crisis, though often there is a gap between willingness and doing.

The Irish Times asked leading climate and energy experts to provide their assessment of CAP24.

Rising emissions have long been a stick with which to beat Ireland over its poor record but Sadhbh O'Neill, senior climate adviser to Friends of the Earth (FoE), highlights indications that emissions have potentially peaked.

""The EPA's projections for 2030 are now for significantly lower emissions than they estimated in 2020,"" says O'Neill.

Lower emissions mean we should expect improved air quality, warmer homes, better public transport, more energy security, lower energy prices, green jobs and opportunities to restore nature, she adds.

""But we should not be complacent. Ireland is dangerously off track to stay within the binding limits on emissions set on a cross-party basis, and many of the Government's proposed measures are not grounded in reality.""

She argues that these rely on wishful thinking, technologies not available at scale and the achievement of 80 per cent renewable electricity, which is unlikely unless dedicated resources are placed in key agencies and grid barriers and planning/regulatory delays addressed. We should learn from what has worked and what hasn't.

""What we can learn from implementation of the annual climate action plans to date is that political will, coupled with a strong and co-ordinated governance framework and legally binding limits on emissions are all essential to drive climate action. If any one of these is lacking, progress will slow and stagnate,"" she warns.

We're still not seeing the paradigm shift in policies, investment and behaviours that climate action demands

-- Sadhbh O'Neill

New infrastructure - wind farms, grid improvements, Metrolink - take years to come on stream, so planning is needed now for what will be in place in the 2030s.

Climate governance, policy co-ordination and consistency have improved dramatically, O'Neill says.

""Emissions are starting to fall in some sectors - and against a backdrop of sustained economic growth, high employment and a growing population,"" she adds. ""This is not insignificant achievement ... 2023 was an impressive year for renewable electricity, with record levels of wind powering Ireland's electricity system.""

However, the list of what hasn't worked is long. ""Many measures delivering emission reductions are targeting 'low hanging fruit' or marginal decreases and won't achieve the scale of emission reductions required under national and EU law for 2030, never mind 2040 or 2050,"" says O'Neill. ""We're still not seeing the paradigm shift in policies, investment and behaviours that climate action demands.""

The plan does not explicitly address the challenge of fossil fuel infrastructure, generation, supply or subsidies. Some carbon-intensive projects likely to lock in fossil fuel demand are still going ahead or being promoted - Dublin Airport expansion, intensive agriculture, new roads and some building projects.

Emissions are still rising or not falling fast enough in some sectors, driven by lack of infrastructure; planning delays are affecting renewable energy projects, public transport and active travel; while growth is driving up energy demand that outpaces renewable energy deployment. There is a lack of incentives or sufficient skilled labour ""and reliance on technofixes and efficiencies that don't exist at scale"", says O'Neill.

Pathways to net zero have to actually reach zero, she adds. ""Winning slowly is the same as losing - this is the inconvenient truth of atmospheric physics. The pace of change is as important as the target. We need to be charting pathways to bring emissions down to net zero and that will require pathways that go well beyond the 2030 target ... Front-loading climate investment is disruptive in the short term but economically prudent.""

As long as ""growth and profits are trumping sustainable investment strategies"", aggregate demand is likely to continue to grow and emissions will creep up again, says O'Neill.

CAP24 is ambitious but ""only as good as its monitoring and implementation"", says Dr Clare Noone of the University of Galway. A more holistic Government approach would be welcome, with ""just transition"" at its heart, she says.

""Transformational change and co-benefits could be better highlighted,"" says Noone. ""Renewable energy is a keystone enabler and the benefits of cleaner air, energy security and climate action need to be taken into account and communicated to the public. This will be particularly important as the required electricity infrastructure is rolled out and opposition may become a barrier to implementation.

""More research and outside-the-box thinking is needed to transform the way we live, in a way that is fair and has benefits - not just climate benefits - for society.""

CAP24 is not accessible to most people, Noone says. The public needs to be able to see the importance of collective action and how they can support it.

Noone points to California, which introduced a law for accessible dwellings (sometimes called 'granny flats'), which had social, economic and environmental benefits, and helped alleviate its housing crisis.

""These new dwellings contributed to sustainability goals because they encouraged density in existing neighbourhoods, which allowed them to tap into existing infrastructure, communities, and services,"" says Noone. ""They also lead to fewer emissions by encouraging shorter commutes. And, because they are smaller, they also require fewer building materials and use less energy to heat.""

Agriculture's impact needs to be better addressed, she says, the key question being: ""How can we feed the world while not damaging it?""

""Agriculture is our main greenhouse contributor ... While [it] is a necessity, we need to find the right balance. This will take many areas working together to figure out. A more holistic cross-Government approach would be welcomed to maximise the benefits for land use, biodiversity, air and water quality - and to ensure a just transition for the farming community.""

Effective climate action requires cutting emissions and adaptation, ie adjusting to present and likely future impacts while avoiding harm to people. The latter is about being resilient, says Dr Stephen Flood, of the Climate Change Advisory Council secretariat.

""Resilience asks how we can shift from short-term, incremental, project-focused and reactive approaches in dealing with climate change to planning and action that is long-term, transformative, holistic and forward-looking,"" he explains.

""Flood adaptation strategies that are informed by resilience thinking include a range of actions for reducing risks, such as analysing hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability before flood events. This forward thinking can help to enhance preparation, response and recovery capacities for when a flood occurs.""

In CAP24 a vision for resilience is set out that includes a proposed national strategy for nature-based - rather than heavy-engineering - solutions to manage increased rainfall and surface-water runoff in urban areas.

""We will need to ensure that our cities and towns are designed to cope,"" says Flood. ""We need so called 'sponge cities' that can absorb the heavy rainfall by increasing the permeability of urban surfaces. ""

Successful climate action will have benefits ""but we must now start asking important questions around risk ownership and the distribution of actions across society"", says Flood.

Energy specialist Brian Ó Gallachóir, of UCC Environmental Research Institute, welcomes stronger focus on local government in CAP24. With the ""national climate objective"" set in law, carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings in place and responsibility allocated to Government departments, new focus must be on the role of local government, ""in implementing measures to meet Ireland's national climate targets and also in supporting and mobilising climate action at the regional and local levels"", he says.

Ó Gallachóir welcomes attempts to bridge the gap between Ireland's emissions ambition and current trends.

The Climate Action Plan's previous iteration had carbon budgets and ceilings but subsequent EPA projections ""showed Ireland is not on track to meet any of the agreed sectoral emissions ceilings or the total carbon budgets"".

CAP24 attempts to bridge this gap to ensure each sector adheres to its emissions ceiling through new policies and identifying corrective actions to ensure delivery of existing measures, he says.

These should include increased targets for retrofitting and heat pumps; further shifting of freight towards rail; managing data centre growth demand; deploying carbon capture and storage technology; and using ""biogenic woody residue"" to produce biochar, which can be used in water treatment, land reclamation and carbon sequestration.

The plan commits to a national campaign of communication and engagement.

""This has the goal of strengthening the social contract between the Government and the Irish people that has arisen through collaboration on climate action, which is both laudable and essential, given the challenges ahead in meeting the ambitious agreed goals,"" says Ó Gallachóir.

Mobilising collective and individual action is welcome, as is acknowledgment that ""different groups have difference capacities to act, and the focus on new, targeted measures to support those who have less access to resources than those who do"", he adds.

However, there is a need to look beyond economic growth, Ó Gallachóir says.

""There are some measures in CAP24 that focus on managing demand growth but discourse around them is difficult, as we see in societal discussions surrounding animal herd numbers, increased flight capacities at airports, restricting data centres growth, etc,"" he explains.

""We need to find a better way to engage on these contentious topics and CAP24 is largely silent on this. Discussions that question our focus on economic growth are difficult.""

In many ways, Ireland currently has two narratives. On our GDP growth and employment it is world leading but ""on our housing crisis, health-system constraints and our performance on climate and biodiversity Ireland is a basket case"", Ó Gallachóir says.

A way to discuss these conflicting narratives together has to be found, he adds.

Climate policies have relied on ""nudges"" in the form of taxes and grants, but to get the urgently needed paradigm shift, much bolder and braver actions are needed, FoE's O'Neill says.

""These should be seen as opportunities to shift to a fossil-free green economy,"" she adds.

Upcoming elections are unnerving for those driving climate action; political turbulence is inevitable. Already there are worrying signs of rollback on Common Agricultural Policy commitments to align EU policies and payments with its biodiversity strategy.

""All of this is as a direct result of lobbying by the agricultural sector that is not adequately scrutinised,"" O'Neill says.

""There's no guarantee political parties won't flip-flop on climate to garner a few votes ... despite strong public support for climate action and the support of most of the political parties for the climate law and carbon budgets.""

Against that backdrop the potential for policy reversals fuelled by climate denial and disinformation on social media platforms is very serious, she says - and certainly not in Ireland's longer-term interests.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,Kevin O'Sullivan,0.1058823529411765,448956181,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/u6eG_FyQyLiAuXRH2TvZ1tU2s3Y=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/37CLGVLTRH5Z4SAYHDTYKSEDKM.jpg,

Notes of concern haven't been completely silenced within the music industry, but after nine consecutive years of sales growth - confirmed in this week's Global Music Report from recording industry group IFPI - the overall tone is now much more upbeat.

A generation in search of ""exciting"" employment is noticing, according to Konrad von Löhneysen, founder and director of German music label Embassy of Music. Speaking at an IFPI panel launching the report on Thursday, he offered this turnaround metric: friends of his are increasingly requesting internships for their children.

""They all want to work in the music business, they all want to work in a record company. No one wanted to do that 15 years ago, they would have rather worked at Google or wherever,"" he said.

""Fifteen years ago we were like a dying breed and now we are the hottest employer for young people so it shows that we are doing something right.""

So, too, of course, does the industry revenue increase of 10.2 per cent for 2023. This was driven largely by growth in paid streaming subscribers, but physical revenues and income from performance rights also climbed, taking total trade revenues of $28.6 billion (€26.4 billion).

Taylor Swift, naturally, was the top artist across all formats, with K-pop boy band Seventeen - which had the biggest album - in second place. Every region worldwide grew, with five of the seven posting double-digit percentage gains.

Fending off the threat to copyright monetisation posed by the ascent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) now looms as the large challenge ahead, but for industry veteran von Löhneysen, the ""fantastic"" nine-year recovery already contrasts sharply with the preceding doom.

""You look at how the atmosphere was in the music business 15 years ago or something, it was very gloomy. It almost felt like the last person in the room was supposed to switch the light off.""

Dr. Phan Tuan Hung, Director of the National Extended Producer Responsibility Council Office, called the EPR an economic tool that follows market principles, and a new policy approach to deal with waste problems.

The EPR also promotes the recycling industry and provides economic and employment opportunities, and helps the Government achieve its environmental goals, he continued.

If properly and fully implemented, the EPR would ensure the circulation of resources between the input and waste stages in the production process and help achieve the goal of no emissions, Hung explained.

""No matter what form of recycling a manufacturing enterprise chooses, cash will flow to businesses that collect and recycle waste,"" he said.

But only advanced and modern recycling technologies that meet environmental standards would benefit from the EPR policy, he stressed, adding that small recyclers who struggle to acquire advanced technologies should join hands.

This is the first year of EPR implementation in Vietnam, and the hope is to create a change in the process of promoting the circular economy.

Local manufacturers and importers have embraced EPR quite early.

In 2021, nine enterprises, including TH Group, Coca-Cola, Friesland Campina, La Vie, Nestle, Nutifood, Suntory PepsiCo, Tetra Pak, and Universal Robina Corporation established the Packaging Recycling Organisation Vietnam.

Its mission is to develop a strong packaging collection and recycling ecosystem that helps increase recycling rates and minimise the rate of packaging discharged into the environment.

It has helped raise consumer awareness about recycling and waste classification and strengthen the existing packaging collection ecosystem.

In addition to the organisation's efforts, its members have also actively responded and signed cooperation agreements with recyclers.

Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage and DUYTAN Plastic Recycling signed a strategic agreement for the supply of recycled plastic to the former to make packaging for its products in 2022-26.

In October 2023, La Vie Limited Liability Company signed a memorandum of understanding for a waste-plastic collection and recycling cooperation programme with DUYTAN Plastic Recycling.

Under the five-year programme, the two have a target of collecting and recycling 11,000 tonnes of plastic waste.

In November, Friesland Campina Vietnam signed an agreement with Dong Tien Binh Duong Paper Company Limited and Truong Thinh Mechanical Construction Company Limited to improve its waste-packaging collection and recycling capacity.

Many Vietnamese businesses are also seeking to invest in recycling plants.

DUYTAN Plastic Recycling has invested 60 million USD in a plastic recycling plant that uses Bottle to Bottle technology. The technology allows plastic to be recycled up to 50 times.

The factory is now among the five most modern and largest that recycle plastic in the world. It has a capacity of 40,000 tonnes a year.

Vietcycle Corporation and ALBA Group have established a 48,000-tonne recycling plant at a cost of 50 million USD. It uses technology from Germany to recycle and create rPET plastic that meets international standards.

""We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,"" he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

""We are committed to work on all such technologies also,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

""With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,"" he added.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

""We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,"" a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

""Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,"" the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

''We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,'' a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

''Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,'' the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

''This will help accelerate the EV ecosystem in India,'' he stated.

In a social media-driven age, artificial intelligence (AI)-)-generated content is rising and presents special difficulties, especially for senior users. As platforms like Facebook witness a surge in the circulation of AI-created images, concerns about misinformation and susceptibility among older demographics have come to the forefront.

With AI algorithms like DALL-E and Midjourney now accessible to the public, the digital landscape is inundated with images that blur the line between reality and fabrication. From seemingly ordinary scenes with surreal elements to uncannily realistic faces that never existed, the proliferation of AI art has reshaped the way we perceive visual content online.

Understanding the perception gap

While younger users often exhibit a discerning eye when encountering AI-generated content, older demographics, particularly Generation X and beyond, seem more susceptible to its deceptive allure. Research suggests that this divergence in perception stems not from cognitive decline but from a lack of familiarity and experience with AI technology.

According to a study conducted by AARP and NORC, only a fraction of adults aged 50 and above reported being well-versed in AI, indicating a significant gap in awareness compared to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, experiments examining participants' reactions to AI-generated images have revealed a tendency among older individuals to attribute them to human creators, highlighting the need for increased education and awareness in this demographic.

Navigating the digital terrain: A call for awareness and regulation

As the prevalence of AI-generated content continues to grow, so do concerns surrounding its potential for exploitation and misinformation, particularly among older users. While older adults may possess a wealth of knowledge and critical thinking skills, they remain vulnerable to sophisticated scams and deceptive practices facilitated by AI technology.

To address these challenges, experts advocate for increased awareness and education initiatives aimed at helping older individuals discern between genuine and AI-generated content. Additionally, calls for regulation and corporate accountability have gained traction, with lawmakers introducing legislation to mitigate the risks posed by deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media.

In the face of an evolving digital landscape, individuals and policymakers are responsible for safeguarding against the proliferation of AI-generated content and its potential impact on society at large. By fostering a culture of critical thinking and equipping users with the tools to navigate the digital terrain responsibly, we can mitigate the risks posed by deceptive AI creations and ensure a safer online environment for all.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Brenda Kanana,0.1215686274509804,448955716,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Default_Generated_Content_and_Its_Impact_on_Older_Users_1-1.jpg,

Held on a cloudy Thursday afternoon, turnout was low, with just two local Dove Bank estate residents pitching in, alongside volunteers from the police, council, and the housing association - in an area police say has been struggling to engage with.

Bolton at Home's Ceri McHugh organised the event, sending out hundreds of flyers to encourage residents to turn up and pitch in.

Ceri said: ""We've organised it to link in with the Great British Spring Clean. As Bolton at Home, we wanted to do something to support that and try to improve the environment and our neighbourhoods.

""We know there's a lot of groups who do go out regularly litter picking and they do a fantastic job, so we just wanted to contribute to that.""

Volunteer Annette Hall is part of the Little Lever litter pickers group.

Also working for Bolton at Home, Annette said: ""I've always done this type of volunteer work in my own private time, it's just something I've been brought up to believe in, and it's just nice to be part of it really, isn't it?""

With land owned and managed by different stakeholders, including the council, Bolton at Home, Great Places, and private owners, it can be difficult to keep things clean and tidy - but volunteers hope cleaning up will encourage residents to take pride in their area.

Not everyone, however, was convinced that the litter pick would help improve the area.

Jean Walkden, aged 79, has lived on the estate since it was built in the 1960s - and her three daughters now live in it too.

Upon witnessing people picking up the litter, she shared her view that the litter would soon return, despite the efforts of volunteers.

Jean said: ""It used to be a lovely estate, it used to be. You couldn't have fencing up like they've got now, you had all that little white fencing up. It were a lovely estate, you had a bench there for old people, but it's just gone to ruin.""

Jean said a garage had been burned (Image: Jack Fifield, Newsquest)

Jean said fire services had to visit the estate over the weekend after a fire broke out in one of the garages.

'A bit upsetting' more residents didn't turn up

Cllr Andrea Taylor-Burke has lived in Little Lever for 18 years, after moving from Great Lever.

She said it was 'a bit upsetting' that more residents hadn't turned up, but that she was happy to get her 'hands dirty'.

The councillor added: ""You have many different discussions with people and they'll say it's due to council cuts, and often I obviously get the brunt of that because I'm a Conservative councillor, so it's our government cuts, but in my eyes it falls to society - this isn't a council issue, it's not a government issue, it's a societal issue.

""We need to be teaching youths - and not just youths, as a lot of litter comes from adults as well - about the importance of respecting where we live, and I think that doesn't boil down to government and cuts, that boils down to loving where you live, and I became a councillor for that reason.

""I became a councillor for that reason, I love where I live and my kids are here, I want my children to respect where they live and I think showing people that it isn't somebody else's job, it's our job to do it, kind of gives that feedback.

""We're not just here doing it to go in the papers, we litter pick all year around, it's getting people to understand: just throwing litter on the floor, somebody else isn't going to pick it up. If it doesn't get picked up, it gets left like this.""

PC Nicki Forsham and police community support officer Wayne Jackson were using the event as an opportunity to pick up litter, and to engage with the community.

The officers had posted an anonymous survey to residents before the event, picking up the results as they picked litter.

Having been in the force for 17 years, PCSO Jackson said: ""We've done every house on the avenue, dropped a leaflet through asking from a scale of bad to good how they feel stuff affects them.

""So, off-road bikes, litter lying around, noisy neighbours - that kind of thing. We're just trying to engage, people are saying there's a lot of off-road motorbikes, but if they're from around here people will know where they are.

""We're trying to be more visible in the area. Rather than having a faceless number to ring, they can come and report it to us.""

Difficulties engaging with the community

PC Forsham agreed that there had been issues engaging with the community previously.

She said: ""It is the case where a lot of people don't want to report things, through maybe fear of reprisals or having a negative effect on them.

""But from being here about 12 months now, a lot of complaints are made by people who live either in the immediate area or not far away.

""It's trying to tackle those who are causing problems, but in a positive way if we can, by getting them to engage through things like the litter pick today.""

PC Forsham, who is herself from Bolton, joined the force seven years ago, after working as a prison officer.

The 34-year-old added: ""We're doing a lot of work with the youths at the moment, to go and do a youth club or outreach services. I appreciate there isn't really anywhere for people to go or much to do.

""It's trying to tackle it through different things really, to make it good for them, a nice place for them all to live and hopefully something that they'll be able to do on the back of these engagement surveys.""

She said her sincere desire is to help visitors and clients to have the best wedding planning experience possible.

Sant-Ghuran said when she started in the wedding planning business there were only a few event courses being offered by the national hospitality school.

""So I attended those, but mostly I learned about events on the job and through experience, which really is the best way!

""Back then, I worked for one of the largest banks in the country and my department was responsible for staff and corporate events. After I left that job, I did HR, marketing and business development at a few other jobs before leaving the corporate world entirely.""

She took a year to plan her next step and realised there was a gap in the wedding planning market, with no online resource for wedding vendors and engaged couples.

""During that year, I did marketing consulting and event management, but more importantly, I started planning for www.trinidadweddings.com, which I started in 2004. We were the first wedding website in the country.

""Our main service is internet advertising and providing promotional and marketing support for brands and wedding vendors with private events, product reviews, give-aways etc.

""When we started in 2004, online advertising was very new, and social media as we know it now was almost non-existent, so wedding vendors were understandably hesitant. Before us, wedding vendors used to promote themselves strictly offline or in traditional media like newspapers and the Yellow Pages. Engaged couples got their information from books, the newspaper, and magazines.""

In addition to the website, trinidadweddings.com offers wedding consulting services, a wedding column, a wedding app, and a magazine.

Sant-Ghuran comes from a background of entrepreneurship, as her parents ran a hardware store in Central Trinidad where she grew up.

""They left banking careers to become entrepreneurs and I was one year old when they launched it. The hardware was where I grew up, since our store was downstairs our house and I learned many things about the real world of business there.""

As the business grew, Sant-Ghuran decided to expand and move to a physical format as well as being online, in order to feature more in-depth stories and content in another medium.

""The first testing of the waters came in 2009, when we put out a digital magazine issue on our website. We had hundreds and hundreds of downloads and so the following year, we decided to do a print hard copy and we called it the TW Wed-Zine (a play on the words 'weddings' and 'magazine').""

The magazine, published once yearly, was sold at bookshops, pharmacies and retailers across TT from 2010-2018, as well as online through the website.

Sant-Ghuran said the magazine was a beautiful, thoughtful magazine resource for brides and grooms.

""Over nine years of publishing we have worked with over 450 wedding vendors and brands, about 50 per issue. Over time, we have carefully built our magazine brand, and it's always a joy to discover that our readers love our voice and carefully-curated content.

""One of our philosophies is to only use real brides on our cover. We want our brides to be able to relate to someone who looks like them. Even though we say we are for brides and grooms, the truth is, all walks of womanhood come to TW Wed-Zine for inspiration, ideas, and of course, love stories.""

She said people ask whether the publication is foreign-based, and she is proud to say it is 100 per cent based on TT.

""We are the only brand serving the TT wedding market with a comprehensive suite of services across major media - print, website and social media. We take great pride in having the highest ratio of quality editorial-to-advertising placements.

""The magazine is my 'greatest love' out of all our services and I feel maybe it was destined for me to do. The subjects I did at A levels were English literature, history and art, and I feel that unique combination really laid the foundation for what I was about to do next in life.""

The company took over distribution of the magazine following the abrupt closure of TT's only magazine distributor in 2018, coupled with the fact that most bookstores and pharmacies stopped stocking local magazines.

Sant-Ghuran said the covid19 pandemic proved detrimental to the event industry as a whole, as public gatherings were prohibited and then restricted. She said publication went on hiatus, but people could expect hard copy and digital editions in 2024. She said the demand for ad spots had been very keen.

""In fact, we are almost sold out for this issue.""

She finds there is a lot of ignorance about marketing, and one of the biggest challenges she faces is educating advertisers.

""Helping vendors and brands understand that their marketing should be a mix of brand activations (these are short-term, like digital promotions) and brand-building activities (these are long-term, like magazines) is a challenge, because they see social media as a 'magic bullet.'

""Yet whilst social media is a useful medium, generally its shelf life is very short and fleeting. So usually your post, after 24 hours (if so much) is going to be easily ignored or forgotten.""

She said print media such as magazines still hold a position of credibility and authority, as well as building community.

""For example, our magazine is shared by brides with their bridal parties, with sisters and cousins, moms and aunties etc. It is passed along, so one magazine generally has a readership of about three-five people! So despite the rise of digital platforms, the enduring appeal and effectiveness of print media shouldn't be overlooked by brands that want to pursue a 360-degree marketing approach. The problem is, most advertisers are only looking at the short term.""

Sant-Ghuran said she hasn't seen her gender make a difference in how brides and suppliers interact with her.

""I deal with all wedding vendors and brands (small or corporate) the same, and that is with respect and genuine concern for them and their business. I think what's more important than gender, is focusing on your skills, expertise and professionalism to build trust and credibility.""

She said what sets her apart from other wedding planners is her focus on the business of weddings, which involves helping wedding vendors and brands reach engaged couples and helping engaged couples get the resources and advice they need.

""Unlike most wedding planners who may just focus on couples and the wedding day, and rightly so, my path led me to experiences that have given me a more bird's-eye perspective, as I have worked on the advertising side of weddings, the publishing side, the planning side, produced bridal events and been a wedding industry educator speaking at international conferences.

She said if she had to pick, she preferred themes that portrayed understated elegance. ""Personally, I don't prefer bohemian, rustic or over-the-top florals. I like French-inspired themes, Great Gatsby themes, tropical-inspired themes or in terms of colour scheme, black and white is timeless and you can never go wrong with all-white decor and design.""

Sant-Ghuran attended St Augustine Girls' High School and then UWI, St Augustine, where she did a degree in business management.

She has diplomas in marketing, digital marketing and fashion journalism. She has used the knowledge she has gained over the years to teach others in TT and regionally.

""I was part of the event management faculty at the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business and during 2011-2019, I trained hundreds of students in TT and Guyana. I am still an adjunct lecturer there in the area of marketing. I'm often asked to be a speaker and trainer, on topics such as marketing, branding, entrepreneurship and publishing.

""I've been a feature speaker at the Jamaica Bridal Expo in September 2016, the Love and Sunshine Destination Wedding Conference in Guyana in April 2017, the Association of Bridal Consultants Conference in New York, also in April 2017, and at a Bride's Expo for Destination Weddings in Fort Lauderdale in June 2018.""

Sant-Ghuran published a book, It's Knot Difficult!, in June 2023. She said it is the first in the wedding planning category/genre from a TT author to be published through Amazon.

""This year, I celebrate 20 years' experience in the wedding industry. I've run the gamut and covered all aspects from wedding planning for couples, teaching event management professionals, being a speaker at international bridal shows, hosting my own bridal shows and events, wedding magazine publishing, being a wedding columnist for 11 years for a leading national newspaper TT and a wedding contributor for other local and international magazines and publications.

She said the most important piece of advice she would give to someone getting married would be to focus on what matters.

""Remember that your wedding is ultimately about celebrating your love and commitment to each other. Focus on the meaningful moments and experiences rather than getting caught up in perfectionism, what other people expect or minor details.""",newsday.co.tt,news,Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,Paula Lindo,0.2313725490196079,448955068,1,https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-24-at-1.31.17-AM-789x1024.png,

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, on par with presidents and popes,"" the letter read. It further stated, ""He didn't take the decision to change his name, potentially sacrificing some of the immense value captured by the brand of 'Kanye West,' lightly.

Kanye West sued by Donna Summer Estate

Controversy's favourite child, rapper Kanye West has landed into another trouble in February this year when he was taken to court by the late Donna Summer's estate. The late singer's estate has alleged that he used a sample of the singer's hit song without permission, reports 'Mirror.co.uk'. Kanye, Ty Dolla $ign, Ye's record label, and more are allegedly being sued by the estate for using Donna's 1977 song 'I Feel Love', according to legal documents.

The 'Gold Digger' rapper released his first album in his 'Vultures 1' compilation earlier this month. Donna's estate claims that the album's song 'Good (Don't Die)' included vocals of the late disco diva after the estate ""explicitly denied"" them permission, according to the suit.

As per 'Mirror.co.uk', Bruce Sudano is listed in the court documents the Executor of the Estate of Donna Summer. The document said he ""seeks to protect Summer's musical legacy that made her the undisputed 'Queen of Disco'.""

The situation that National Assembly Speaker, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula finds herself does not bode well for her position.

The statement is according to Executive Director of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, Lawson Naidoo.

The expert says her actions have far a reaching impact.

The Hawks raided Mapisa-Nqakula's house, east of Johannesburg, amid allegations she took bribes while she was still the Defence Minister.

Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula | Pressure on NA Speaker to step down:

Naidoo says in a country struggling to rid itself of corruption, persons occupying the office of the Speaker must show impeccable integrity.

The Speaker must also ensure the policies of Parliament are always in compliance with laws governing administration, as well as laws governing the use of public finances.

""Somebody that has been entrusted with holding a very high office is under investigation, is likely to be charged, we hear, with corruption, that's an extremely serious charge, and it should be of grave concern. The house is one of the institutions that we as the public rely on to exercise oversight over the executive, to pass laws, it is the house that represents our views as South Africans, and she occupies the position as the head of that institution, so ultimately it does impact on every single one of us.""

Meanwhile, former National Assembly speaker, Baleka Mbete has defended the current Speaker Mapisa-Nqakula on the corruption allegations leveled against her.

She says those who accuse Mapisa-Nqakula do not have concrete evidence. Mbete says there is a vendetta to discredit the current National Assembly Speaker.

Speaking to the SABC on the sidelines of the Battle of the Cuito Cuanavle commemoration in Pretoria, Mbete expressed her views on the matter.

""They violated her privacy and she allowed them to do so in calmness and dignity and I just think they should be ashamed of themselves. You must say what it is that you want a person to account for. Yes, sure there must be accountability but come and say what is it that you are looking for on the basis of what.""",sabcnews.com,news,"SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

GEM is a collective of Philippine destinations that are lauded for their conservation efforts and practices, sustainable goods and services, as well as effective coral reef ecosystem management. Deemed worthy to be part of the GEM are five local destinations -- Coron in Palawan, Panglao in Bohol, Siargao in Surigao del Sur, Puerto Galera in Mindoro and El Nido in Palawan.

To support government efforts to promote GEM, digital travel platform Agoda puts its own spotlight on three of the five GEM destinations that are leading the pack in more conscious tourism: Coron, Panglao and Siargao.

Coron and Siargao Island are havens for those seeking tranquility by the sea, while Panglao offers quiet beaches and diving spots. Beyond their stunning seascapes, all three destinations make it easy for travelers to take part in conservation practices that keep these beloved destinations pristine.

Coron, Palawan

World-renowned for its lush islands and serene waters in shades of emerald and turquoise, experiences beyond sea activities can be also be enjoyed in Coron, Palawan.

Travelers can visit Coron Natural Farms, which holds generations' worth of knowledge in eco-tourism and indigenous wisdom, for a day tour that will showcase the rudiments of natural farming. The activity culminates in an authentic farm-to-table and even a reef-to-table experience, where travelers get to enjoy cuisine made from local produce, such as arugula, chicken eggs, and various seafood. The seafood is harvested from the reef, which is protected by the farm's ridge-to-reef structure.

A trip to Palawan would not be complete without island hopping. With Agoda's Activities feature, travelers can book packages such as the Coron Palawan Reef & Wrecks Tour, which introduces travelers to marine life and a gunboat wreck from the distant past, at a great deal.

Panglao, Bohol

Panglao is every bit an eco-friendly destination starting from the Bohol-Panglao International Airport. Tagged as ""the green gateway,"" the Philippines' first eco-airport features natural ventilation and harnesses solar energy to meet one-third of its electrical needs.

Panglao serves as the perfect jump-off point for travelers looking to explore Bohol province. Aside from its tranquil beaches that have regular clean-ups, which tourists can participate in, a short boat ride away is Balicasag Island, a marine sanctuary with sea turtles and colorful corals. A popular activity is a boat tour around Balicasag, where travelers can learn about the efforts Boholanos take to preserve the environment on top of enjoying the sights.

Flights and accommodation options are plenty within Panglao. Through Agoda, travelers can enjoy the best deals by booking flights and accommodation packages with the convenience of having everything on one platform.

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

With the active participation of its friendly locals, Siargao has a diverse ecosystem that is protected through regular beach clean-ups, establishment of marine sanctuaries and reforestation projects.

Local businesses actively participate in ensuring eco-friendliness through renewable energy, organic toiletries and locally sourced food. Besides its surf spots, vacationers traveling to Siargao can enjoy boat tours discovering hidden lagoons like Sugba Lagoon, exploring the island's mangrove forests and trekking the hiking spots within Siargao, such as Corregidor Island.

Whether for a weekend getaway, an island escape, or a family holiday, travelers can plan their meaningful beach escape with Agoda from start to end.

For additional ways to travel more consciously and help fund conservation efforts, check Agoda's Eco Deals 2024, which was launched last March 3. Travelers can participate in the Eco Deals campaign by visiting www.agoda.com/Ecodeals or by booking properties that showcase the Eco Deals badge on Agoda's website or app. For each such booking, Agoda will donate a dollar to World Wildlife Fund's conservation initiatives, including the protection of Whale Sharks in the Philippines.",philstar.com,news,Philstar.com,Dolly Dy-Zulueta,0.4901960784313726,448954407,1,https://media.philstar.com/photos/2024/03/18/2_2024-03-18_01-14-59.jpg,

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",kion546.com,news,KION546,Associated Press,0.05098039215686279,448954356,1,https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,

Paul has now completed a recovery programme in Cornwall and has opened up about his life to warn others.

Paul describes his life as ""very patchy"" saying he ""would start drinking the moment I finished work"". He said he was completely without hope, until he was matched with WithYou, a charity providing free, confidential support to people experiencing issues with drugs, alcohol or mental health.

Now Paul has turned his life around with the help of WithYou he's found a job, and he wants to warn people about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and has shared his life story to do so. He said: ""I can remember some parts of it - I relied on drinking pretty much most days.

""I would finish work and start drinking the moment I finished work. I was applying for numerous jobs, but this was really disheartening as I wasn't getting any responses, and the feeling of rejection was very real.

""I was always questioning 'Why weren't employers getting back to me?' Nobody wants to employ somebody who doesn't have anything to offer at that time, and who is dependent on alcohol.""

The help Paul received to change his situation came from WithYou in Cornwall's Individual Placement and Support (IPS) service. The approach offers intensive, individually tailored support to help individuals in drug and alcohol recovery find - and retain - the right job, as access to career support is proven to play a vital role in drug and alcohol recovery.

At WithYou in Cornwall, over the last year, the dedicated IPS team has supported 162 clients. This includes helping people to choose a job which is right for them, supporting them with the recruitment process, and offering ongoing support to them and their new employer to help ensure the person keeps their job.

Paul is one of the people whose life has been changed by the IPS team. He came to WithYou in Cornwall and met his recovery worker, Annabelle, who he said had been 'super supportive' throughout his journey.

Paul said: ""I can't thank Annabelle enough for everything she has done for me during my recovery. Annabelle spoke to me about the IPS service, and I was put in touch with a specialist who spoke to me at length about my work history and what I wanted to do moving forward.""

Prior to finding out about WithYou, and joining the IPS programme, Paul describes his life as 'very patchy'. With support from the IPS team, Paul started making tweaks to his CV and regularly attended WithYou's IPS meetings. The meetings gave Paul the opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who were going through similar experiences and he soon became an IPS champion.

""This involved attending a job fair in Plymouth, which I found very interesting. It was good to see how employers interact with the public, but it was also good to see the IPS team approach employers, and how they both interact with each other: hear employers' views on addiction and what support there is available in their own company.""

With Annabelle, Sheree, and the wider support from the IPS team, Paul secured permanent employment.

""I've been here for three to four months. They have changed my contract from a seasonal 16-hour contract to a full-time 16-hour contract.

""It's nice to have an employer that cares about you as an individual. I like to have something to focus on: without focus [life] is very ad hoc and I've got no plans.

""But, having a job, and having somebody to be able to support me in that job has been brilliant. Working with WithYou and the IPS programme has been a positive experience, and I can't thank the whole team enough, especially Annabelle and Sherree, who have supported me through my journey.

""They never judged me: they believed in me when I was at my lowest, not feeling that I was going to succeed. Perseverance and regular appointments with them all gave me hope.""

DBS Foundation has unveiled the 24 Businesses for Impact (BFIs) that have received the DBS Foundation Grant Award in the latest instalment of this flagship initiative. Five of these awardees are from India and will receive funding and access to a suite of opportunities including networking and patient capital to scale up operations, while collectively uplifting lives and livelihoods.

These purpose-driven BFIs are working at the nexus of economic, environmental and social impact and their innovative solutions are a pathway to a more inclusive, low carbon future. Project Baala, with its focus on sustainable menstrual solutions and literacy, aims to improve the health of women and girls in rural areas. Green Worms is an emerging circular economy enterprise generating employment for women, while Zerund Manufacturing is reshaping the building materials industry with eco-friendly solutions. Karo Sambhav is enabling a more circular economy by implementing collection and recycling solutions for electronic and other types of waste, while Swachh Sustainable Solutions (ReCircle) is championing a traceable supply chain for waste pickers.

The five Indian BFIs were among the 24 finalists for the DBS Foundation grant from across Asia. From a record ~2000 grant applications received across DBS markets, the final grantees were evaluated based on stringent criteria, including their ability to create social and environmental impact, to innovate and on the overall sustainability and scalability of their organisations. The winning BFIs will receive holistic support to scale both their business and the impact generated through grant funding totalling SGD 3.7 million for all the grantees; along with additional support such as customized banking services and capacity-building, along with access to business prospects.

Shoma Narayanan, Managing Director, Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank India said, ""Through the DBS Foundation Grant Programme, we are proud to have the opportunity to try and address any funding challenges faced by these innovative businesses that are doubling down on ways to tackle social issues, while uplifting the most vulnerable among us. This year's awardees from India, focusing on areas like waste management, responsible consumption, inclusive employment and women's health, are working on sustainable solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time. We believe that the DBS Foundation grant and comprehensive support will go a long way towards empowering these businesses to drive positive change and champion social impact.""

Collectively, with the DBS Foundation's support, these 24 BFIs aim to achieve significant milestones by the end of 2025. In India specifically, Project Baala will use the grant for the launch of hydrophobic sanitary pads in India, reducing plastic waste while educating underserved women. The grant will enable Karo Sambhav to launch an e-waste management facility in Maharashtra, generating green jobs and enabling the recovery of critical minerals. Green Worms will utilise the grant to expand its recycling facility in Kerala, befitting more than 120 villages in the region through waste management and job creation. Swachh Sustainable Solutions (ReCircle) plans to use the funds to enhance its traceability platform ClimaOne, diverting 400 tons of waste from landfills, while improving the lives of waste pickers. Zerund Manufacturing will be able to scale up using the funds, to produce eco-friendly construction materials. The growth of these businesses aligns with India's pathway to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by addressing climate change concerns as well as the challenges faced by underprivileged and marginalised communities.

2024 marks the 10 year of the DBS Foundation's work, championing BFIs and equipping them for success. To date, funding totalling SGD 17 million has been awarded to 140 of the region's most innovative BFIs via the DBS Foundation Grant Award. This has helped to address the funding gap commonly faced by many of these young enterprises and the grant awardees have since gone on to raise more than ten-fold in follow-on funding.

They signed veteran Javonte Green to a 10-day contract, meaning he'll spend at least a few games with the Bulls before the year comes to a close.

Green spent two-and-a-half seasons with the Bulls after getting traded from Boston to Chicago at the 2021 deadline. Though undersized, Green turned himself into a reliable rotation piece for Billy Donovan at the forward position. And now, after a season-ending knee injury ended his season last year, Green is back with the Bulls and ready to give it his all.

To him, his last stint in Chicago feels like a lifetime ago. (H/t Julia Poe of the Chicago Tribune)

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency released its final emissions standards rule, requiring that 70% of new vehicle sales be pure battery-powered electric or hybrids by 2032.

Prohibition was a disaster and ended 13 years after it began. If implemented, this rule to take away Americans' choice in cars will be equally harmful.

This new rule comes at a time when auto manufacturers are dialing back on EV investments because EVs are left unsold on dealers' lots. EV maker Fisker has stopped production. Apple is switching from building EVs to investing in artificial intelligence. Ford has paused shipments of the new F-150 Lightning pickup trucks. Mercedes and BMW no longer plan to go all-electric by 2030.

EVs are more expensive, take a long time to recharge, and lose battery range in cold weather -- especially when car heating is used. The bestselling vehicle in America is the F-150 pickup truck, and the electric version costs $17,000 more than the gasoline model and does not have the towing or lugging capability of the gas-powered version.

This rule will put small businesses and farmers who need gasoline-powered pickup trucks out of business. They can't do their jobs with electric vehicles, because recharging saps valuable time from a day. Consider landscapers who go from house to house improving people's yards. No charging stations are nearby, and they can't take two-hour breaks to find a charging station to recharge.

The disproportionate effect on small businesses and agriculture will result in higher prices for services and food, and upward pressures on inflation. People already follow food prices closely and complain that food costs more.

The rule will cause electricity outages because the grid, even by 2032, is unlikely to be set up for 10 million electric vehicles (70% of today's new car sales) to charge, a number that would grow over time.

Electricity outages mean that people won't be able to charge their EVs, and that other services and appliances that rely on electricity won't be reliable either. That means scheduling homework and cooking around when the power comes on.

A companion power-plant rule from the EPA, not yet released in final form, would make electricity more expensive. The proposed rule would require the closure by 2040 of all power plants that did not sequester 90% of carbon emissions. In an act of stunning dishonesty, EPA does not mention its proposed power-plant rule in its final emissions standards rule.

EPA justifies its regulation on the grounds that America will have cleaner air. But EVs are not emissions free, and they impose costs on the environment that gasoline-powered cars do not share. Electrifying the U.S. vehicle fleet would have practically no effect on global temperatures by 2100, even as it raises inflation and lowers gross domestic product.

Electricity for battery-powered vehicles comes from coal and natural gas, rather than renewables. Solar, wind, and nuclear power are generally fully used for other purposes, and additional sources of energy to meet electricity demand come from fossil fuels and hydropower. Until emissions-free fuels are common enough to have a net environmental benefit, battery-powered vehicles will not reduce emissions.

Producing batteries causes emissions. Batteries are produced in China, using energy from coal-fired power plants. Producing batteries for electric vehicles uses carbon, and the longer the range of the battery, the more carbon is used. In addition, transporting batteries from China to the United States generates emissions.

Mining battery ingredients causes environmental damage. EV batteries weigh about 1,000 pounds and can reach 2,000 pounds. About 100,000 pounds of ore are needed to get the lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and copper to make the batteries function. To get the 100,000 pounds of ore, it's necessary to move 500,000 pounds of earth.

Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is partly performed by children who are sent into the mines to retrieve the minerals. China, Chile, Argentina, and Australia are home to potentially damaging lithium mines.

When the battery is worn out, it must be disposed of. Some materials such as plastics, copper, aluminum, nickel, and cobalt are worth recycling. The remainder is disposed of in landfills, using a method to ensure that the lithium-ion batteries do not catch fire.

Raising the cost of transportation and meddling with Americans' personal mobility is never wise. EVs are not suited for most of America, a large country of wide-open spaces, where inexpensive individual car transportation is a birthright.

This sweeping industrial policy will have disastrous economic and personal effects, as manufacturers waste resources investing in products that many do not want to buy, and as the cost of transportation rises.

Banning alcohol didn't work as intended, and neither will banning the internal combustion engine.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Working in partnership with Bike Worcester, Kidical Mass, in Dines Green, will take place for the first time this Sunday (March 24).

The event, geared towards cyclists of all age groups and skill levels, will kick off from the Green Hub on Gresham Road at 12.45pm.

Whether you would prefer to ride or scoot on stabilisers or balance bikes, or sat in a child seat or trailer, all are welcome to join in.

Kate and Rob Collier, the organisers, said: ""The enthusiasm of parents and kids for taking part in the weekly school bike bus to Honeywell Primary School, gave us the idea of putting on the first Kidical Mass bike ride in Dines Green.

""We're looking forward to welcoming everyone, it's a lot of fun to ride together as a group.""

The event aims to encourage movement among children and young people by bike and on foot, with hopes of them continuing to do so into adulthood.

Worcester began participating in Summer 2022, pulling in 60-70 participants each time.

After the ride, families are invited to wind down with some cardboard craft activities.

Reliant Cycle Services will be providing maintenance support for the bikes, dealing with minor tweaks, such as brakes and gears.

Kim Price, a parent who volunteers on the Honeywell Primary School Bike Bus, said: ""I help out every Wednesday for the bike bus because it's such a rewarding thing to do, the kids are amazing.

""It's nice to be out in the open air rather than being stuck in a car and I'm working on my fitness alongside raising 3 children.

""I joined in my first Kidical Mass bike ride last month, it was so much fun and we're excited for this Sunday.""

Bike Worcester, the event's partner, is a community group working to improve cycling safety around the city.

It operates a bike recycling scheme refurbishing and providing bikes to those who need them.

Smith, who entered the game in the 89th minute, used his left foot to beat Colorado goalkeeper Zach Steffen into the left side of the box, carrying the Dynamo (2-1-1, seven points) to their second straight victory. Smith's shot was just the second on goal for Houston.

Dynamo goalkeeper Steve Clark was credited with two saves while recording his first shutout of the year and the 63rd of his 11-year MLS career. Clark and the Houston defense had to fend off the Rapids for five additional minutes after Smith's tally.

The Rapids (1-2-2, five points) outshot Houston 8-5 and also had just two shots on goal. Colorado is still winless in two home games this season.

The Dynamo got the game's first real scoring chance in the 22nd minute when Ibrahim Aliyu hit a right-footed shot from the center of the penalty area, but Steffen made the save.

The Rapids swung back with a Djordje Mihailovic shot on goal in the 42nd minute that forced Clark to make a stop.

After the teams exchanged yellow cards midway through the second half, Colorado's Kevin Cabral challenged Clark with a left-footed shot from the center of the box in the 66th minute, but Houston's last line of defense was up to the task.

The Mihailovic tried again to beat Clark in the 75th minute from near the same spot as Cabral, but could not get his shot past the Houston keeper.

Climate Change Weekly (CCW) has reached a milestone, its 500th edition. Joe Bast, the founder and first president of The Heartland Institute, charged James Taylor, then managing editor of Heartland's Environment & Climate News (now its president), with creating a weekly newsletter highlighting and summarizing important stories and research about climate science, economics, and policy each week.

Over time, CCW has become Heartland's most widely read, longest continuously running newsletter -- telling you the importance and continued relevance of the topic, its ongoing interest to readers, and, for good and bad, the copious amount of material we've had to write about. CCW currently has more than 6,000 weekly subscribers and many more readers online.

Joe Bast used to tell me ""we've won the war on climate change,"" yet the battle still proceeds apace, sadly displaying that facts either take a while to sink in, or don't easily displace firmly held lies backed by powerful interests. I would honestly like to put this apocalyptic climate change fairy tale to bed once and for all, and write instead on other environmental topics that I think are important but flying under the radar -- but we still have to fight.

My mom used to work for a Social Security judge. Over lunch one day I asked her how she felt about me working for an organization that was fighting to put the Social Security system out of business, and thus her out of work. She just laughed and said ""Do your worst son!"" She knew the Social Security system wasn't going away any time soon, and that's how I feel about climate change. As long as there is money and power at stake, regardless of the facts, as an issue and policy it will be around. Sad but true.

Which brings us to CCW's continuing importance. Facts, data, and evidence must be brought to bear repeatedly, the light must be shined on falsehoods over and over, in order to finally vindicate the continued use of fossil fuels and their critical importance to humanity. As a trained ethicist, to me the defense of fossil fuels and the need to take down climate lies is not about economic efficiency -- though that's important, or environmental quality -- although I care about that. It is fundamentally about human well-being. Banning the use of fossil fuels will make people poorer, society less well off, and cost lives, possibly in the millions; it will also rob people of the essential freedom of choice. Also, ending fossil fuel use won't change the weather or control the climate -- so the effort is all pain, no gain. That is what is at stake.

Looking back over past issues CCW has evolved in form, a bit. When Taylor first started writing CCW, it usually consisted of a lead essay of about 500 or 600 words, and usually five or six single-paragraph summaries, though in a few issues I found as many as nine separate summaries, covered in a total of about 1,600 to 1,800 words. Over time, the lead essay expanded by a couple of hundred words and the number of summaries dropped to four or five an issue, with the research or policies referenced discussed in more detail.

As I write CCW today, the lead essay is sometimes as long as 1,200 words, though I try to limit myself to 1,000, and four summaries are usually the maximum number, although it is usually two or three. My goal for the summaries is, if the readers read my summaries, they don't have to (although they can) read the underlying research or story themselves. I try to give them all the important facts. Perhaps because I'm not as concise a writer as Taylor, each issue now comes in at around 2,000 words. Fewer topics covered, but more detail provided.

Over time, as new issues arose, CCW has addressed them. When Taylor was writing CCW, ESG, government efforts to push electric vehicles, and lawfare, the use of lawsuits by city and state governments, and private parties supposedly representing youths, had yet to become issues. They have become regular topics of discussion and analysis in CCW in recent years. In 2014, when I took over CCW, government efforts to shut down coal and natural gas powerplants through the power of the pen, regulations, and executive orders -- not laws -- were in their infancy. They have since become pervasive and all too successful, despite Heartland's best efforts to publicize how dangerous the policy is.

When James was writing CCW, the Kyoto Climate Treaty was the international bete noire. Now we dismantle and mock the Paris Climate Agreement, which has failed as badly as the Kyoto treaty did.

Sadly, despite CCW's repeated refutations of false claims of climate disaster and its presentation of peer-reviewed climate research that undermines the constant claim that there is a consensus that humans are causing catastrophic climate change, many of the false narratives debunked in CCW's early years still regularly arise after 13 years of exposing them as lies.

For example, in issue 135, the last with Taylor at the helm, he discussed polling which showed people don't care much about climate change and are unwilling to pay much to fight it. Since that time, the media has repeatedly claimed climate change is an existential threat that the public cares about and wants the government to do something about. But in truth, the polling hasn't changed. People still rank climate change near last or dead last among the issues of concern they want politicians to address, and are still unwilling to pay much to fight it.

My first issue (CCW 136) discussed the urban heat island effect. After more than 20 years of discussion, and multiple peer reviewed publications exposing how it biases the ground-based temperature record, government scientists have still stubbornly refused to acknowledge the scope of the problem, or stop using woefully, badly-sited temperature stations that skew the reported average temperature record upward.

When Taylor wrote, CCW discussed the Climategate scandal. Since that time, we've had Climategate 2.0 and 3.0. Early CCWs regularly reported on data and research which directly refuted claims that climate change was: making hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, and other natural disasters worse; that it was causing more deaths from weather and heat; and, that it was causing a dangerous decline in crop production. The same false claims continue to be made today, 13 years later, even though additional years of data still show people are living longer, fewer people are dying from temperature-related illness or extreme weather, crops are setting records, and natural disasters have not become more frequent or severe. It seems that the truth is less immediately compelling than one might hope.

The work The Heartland Institute does is important, and after 500 editions, CCW still continues to be vital to that work; the work of advancing personal liberty and economic freedom by promoting good public policy and fighting against laws and regulations that limit freedom and economic progress.

Climate Change Roundtable is now The Climate Realism Show. The same great climate news and analysis from The Heartland Institute's world-class climate and energy experts, but a snazzy new name that gets right to the heart of what it is about. On episode 102 of The Climate Realism Show, we do a ""Climate Fact Check"" with Steve Milloy of JunkScience.com ffor some recent claims that have been made in the media.

For at least a decade and a half, those pushing the narrative that climate change poses a catastrophic threat to the Earth and all its inhabitants have argued the current period of geologic time should be referred to as the Anthropocene, implying that the impacts of human activities have become so profound and pervasive it should mark a change in how geologists refer to the present epoch. Their argument is that we have crossed a boundary in the way the Earth's biosphere functions, its ecosystems interact, and living beings survive (or don't) and flourish or decline.

Geologists, the official ""keepers"" of the geological timeline, who label epochs, have now spoken on this claim, rejecting it soundly.

The question of when epochs change and the causes of that change are important, shaping the ""terminology in textbooks, research articles and museums worldwide,"" notes The New York Times (NYT). ""It would guide scientists in their understanding of our still-unfolding present for generations, perhaps even millenniums, to come.""

We are currently in what geologists have labeled the Holocene, an interglacial cycle that began about 12,000 years ago, ending the last major ice age. Proponents of the view that humans are causing profound, calamitous, climate change proposed that geologists recognize the impact of the rise of human civilization, particularly after the first atomic bomb was tested, as marking a new epoch; one where the planet's biosphere is no longer dominated by nature and the cosmos, but by humankind.

After 15 years of studying and debating the issue, a panel of experts with the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS, which governs the labeling of the geologic timescale), said the recent period is not that unique or consequential. Humans impacted the Earth long before either atomic testing or climate change became a concern. Our development has depended on and continues to be interwoven with nature. Reporting on the ICS panel's decision, the NYT writes:

Is it time to mark humankind's transformation of the planet with its own chapter in Earth history, the ""Anthropocene,"" or the human age?

Not yet, scientists have decided, after a debate that has spanned nearly 15 years. ...

A committee of roughly two dozen scholars has, by a large majority, voted down a proposal to declare the start of the Anthropocene, a newly created epoch of geologic time, according to an internal announcement of the voting results seen by The New York Times.

The vote wasn't even close. The ICS panel rejected the proposal to label the period since nuclear bombs were first tested as the Anthropocene, by a vote of 12 against, four in favor and two abstaining, and three neither voting nor officially abstaining.

The New American quotes two scientists discussing the decision:

""The decision is definitive,"" says Philip Gibbard, a geologist at Cambridge and a member of the ICS. ""There are no outstanding issues to be resolved. Case closed.""

""The Anthropocene epoch was pushed through the media from the beginning -- a publicity drive,"" said Stanley Finney, a stratigrapher at Cal State Long Beach and the head of the International Union of Geological Sciences.

Geologists understand perspective. Humans undoubtedly have a huge impact on the planet, but it is not significant enough to have overtaken nature or be taken note of from a geologic perspective.

Climate alarmists would have one believe that humans control Earth's thermostat and threaten its ability to sustain life. This is false. Geologists have looked at the past history of the Earth's changes and determined that the human impact on earth just doesn't fit that scale of change. This thoroughly refutes the climate alarm narrative.

A ruling at this time doesn't mean that in the future the ICS won't reconsider its decision should additional evidence indicate epoch relabeling is merited, but for the present time the issue is settled as a matter of geology -- unless the ICS as a whole rejects its panel's overwhelming decision, which is not expected.

Ted Nordhaus, director of the Breakthrough Institute, goes through extreme weather event after extreme weather event using data and historical documentation in an article in The New Atlantis to show that climate change is not making weather-related disasters worse and that human lives are in fact improving even as the climate warms. Having said that, some decisions and actions humans are taking are making natural disasters more costly, in terms of dollars if not lives.

In ""Did Exxon Make It Rain Today?,"" Nordhaus uses historical documentation and data to make three main points: ""Headlines blaming extreme weather on climate change don't hold up,"" there is ""peril"" in catastrophism, and ""we're actually safer than ever before.""

Nordhaus first refutes the near constant drumbeat of environmental alarm that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more deadly. As he explains:

[T]he list of the worst climate-related disasters in U.S. history, those that claimed a thousand or more American lives, is dominated by events that occurred before 1940. There were hurricanes in 1893, 1893 again, 1899, 1900, and 1928; heat waves in 1896 and 1936; floods in 1862 and 1889; and wildfires in 1871 and 1918. By contrast, since 1940 only three climate disasters have claimed a thousand or more lives: a heat wave in 1980, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Maria in 2017.

The story is much the same globally. Two climate disasters have claimed a million or more lives, both of them floods in China, in 1887 and 1931. Tropical storms in South Asia claimed multiple hundreds of thousands of lives in 1737, 1839, and 1876. The more recent climate catastrophes with comparable death tolls, such as the cyclone that killed up to half a million people in what is now Bangladesh in 1970, and the typhoon and resulting dam failure that took a similar toll in China in 1975 amid the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, have reliably occurred at the intersection of poverty, dense population, inadequate infrastructure, and failing political institutions.

It should be noted that each of the pre-climate-hype disasters occurred at a time when the human population and population density were much lower than at present.

Concerning various types of extreme weather events or climate-related ""disasters,"" wildfires, cyclones, and floods, Nordhaus explains they have, by and large, not become measurably more frequent or severe.

In my view, the most important point in Nordhaus's essay concerns society's resilience in the face of climate change, regardless of the cause or type of change. He writes:

The implications of this point will be counterintuitive for many. Yes, there are many types of disasters, like hurricanes and floods, that are causing greater economic costs in many places than they used to. But this is almost entirely because the places that are most exposed to weather disasters have far more people and far more wealth in harm's way than they used to. Even if there were no global warming, in other words, these areas would be much more at risk simply because they have much more to lose.

Once you factor out how many more people and how much more economic activity are in exposed areas, the economic costliness of weather extremes in recent decades has generally been flat or declining, not rising. The human costs, meanwhile, measured by deaths associated with climate and weather extremes, have fallen dramatically over the last century. Improving infrastructure and technology have made most people much more resilient to climate hazards today, even in relatively poor regions and even as the climate has warmed.

Still, there has been no shortage of tragedies associated with extreme weather events in recent decades. But where they do occur, it is almost entirely due to failures of institutions and infrastructure, not the additional extremity of the weather event due to climate change.

Nordhaus is not the first scholar to make these points. Climate Realism has repeatedly made these points, providing links to data and copious research that make the case that despite modest warming, humans are doing better and, where costs of natural disasters are rising, it is due to the expanding bullseye effect of more people living in. and more infrastructure being constructed in, areas already prone to natural disasters.

Mbisiogu, who sees steady power as the solution to most of the country's current economic challenges, wants Nigeria to take a cue from China's development model.

Your firm, Blue Diamond Logistics, has consistently blazed the trail, satisfying customers' needs for 30 years. What has kept it this strong?

Blue Diamond Logistics started years back about three decades now. We started from Dubai and to the glory of God, we have strong presence in five countries - Dubai, China, Turkey, Vietnam among others. The core of our services is ensuring that Nigerians, who think of doing international business, have hitch free transactions. We help interested individuals in taking up documentation because most of them have difficulties in getting their items. We further guide them on documents preparation and help them to source for these products outside Nigeria, especially in Turkey and China. Because of the language barrier, we act as the middle person between the buyer and supplier. Also, we assist them in monitoring their products in terms of quality control. My staff are always on ground to ensure that what they purchase is what the Chinese people are sending to them after which we handle the shipment of their commodities via air and sea. Through our third party, we handle the clearing aspect and send it to their doorpost. Our aim is to ensure that our clients have hitch free transactions and this has kept the company going all these years.

Core values

Our company is big on trust and integrity. Those who deal with us are still with us because of integrity. I remember someone telling me that he sent money to one of the shipping agents in China and lost about $100,000,000 because the person could not be reached. In our company, we make it a point of duty to cultivate the habit of integrity and trust by ensuring that when we tell you that your goods will be received within a period of time, we work tirelessly to make sure it is received within the duration. That is trust and competence. As stated in our flyers, there are three cardinal points that we give to customers - speed, safety of customer goods and accuracy. All these things are very important to us.

What is in our mind is hitch free transactions. Uzotex Bonded Terminal in Lagos is one of our chains of businesses because 70 per cent of the containers that come into this country are sent to different bonded terminals. For years, It has been our company's plan to expand our operations on the side of the bonded terminal. We are so happy to be granted the licence to operate a bonded terminal because we intend to assist the Federal Government in decongesting the port. And with the customs on duty, we want to assist our customers with fast tracking their containers when they are sent to our bonded terminal. Also, we want to ensure prompt monitoring of their consignment. The bonded terminal has been in our expansion plan. There was a time in this country that the sea port was crowded with containers. That time, our containers would arrive and it would take about two weeks to get to bonded terminals. The thought of joining other people delivering these services prompted the idea of having a bonded terminal to assist the federal government in helping to decongest Apapa Port and make it easier for the industry to excel. We felt it would help our customers and the nation as well.

Volatile economy

For Blue Diamond Logistics, we are being faced with a whole lot of challenges. One, we don't have short term plans because of frustration caused by the dollar and the cost of clearing too. Within two to three months, customs has increased duties more than five or six times. Before, to clear a container of 40 feets would cost around N7,000,000; now, it is about N19,000,000. So many bonded terminals are being closed because people can no longer import. It is too difficult to operate in such an environment. For instance, there was this order we placed. As of the time we placed it, the cost was around N80,000,000, if you place the same order now, you will find it difficult to pay for that goods. Because of the exchange rate, which has doubled, it is now around N160,000,000. Many companies are seriously affected and there is no replacement. Why prices of commodities will keep rising in this country is because there is no alternative to these products. If there were alternatives, there would be competition. For us, it has not been easy but we are still in it because of the passion we have. To break even is too difficult, making profit is too difficult for us. One, because we no longer import as only few are importing. Those who have placed orders cannot pay to complete it, not to talk of shipment. We have the passion to assist our customers but this is a trying time for us and we can't quit now because we want our customers to have hitch free transactions. It is not easy for any company. We have explored all strategies to keep the company going and it is failing us because we can't control the monetary policies, which is hurting us so much.

Shanghai Engineering Works

What brought about Shanghai Engineering Works and Industries Limited was as a result of government's clarion call for people to relocate their firms back home in 2011. I yielded the call. However, I remember telling them on their visit to China that it is not easy for Nigerians to relocate their firms back home because of the issue of steady power supply. I also cited to them the Canton Fair that always takes place in China, the industrial part of that fair. Nigerians don't go there because they keep wondering where they would get electricity to power all the machines. But some of us took that bold step and went into that section to import heavy duty machines. As I speak now, the situation is devastating.

Some of the promises made were like a mirage in the sense that the company looked for where to get light to manufacture. We pushed and we got light. It took me about N40,000,000 to get light in my factory. They call that line a 'dedicated line' and that line is not consistent. The kind of production we do in that factory doesn't allow for a break in transmission. Once there is a break in power transmission, the whole material will be stocked, and it takes about one or two hours to restart it. You have to flush and start again. We needed a steady power supply and all efforts to solve that problem were not yielding fruit. We now resorted to being on generator, thus buying various sizes. Before we knew it, diesel increased significantly. When I was interviewed in London a while ago, I gave them a comparative analysis that we use about 10,000 litres of diesel monthly which is about N30,000,000. I told them that we cannot continue this way. As a manufacturer you have to input the cost of diesel, the cost of maintenance, overhead cost into your products before selling. As I speak to you, the operation in my factory has reduced to almost 30 per cent. Because of this hardship and the dollar issue, we have downsized.

Worse of it is the lack of a steady power supply. It is the worst so far. Almost 70 per cent of our staff has been asked to leave our company in Owerri. I remember testifying to the media that when we started newly, some customers were happy that some of the products they bought abroad, they now buy in Port Harcourt. We import so much because we don't produce and that is why we keep looking for dollars. If we have a conducive environment for our factories, we won't have this dollar scarcity. What we have, won't go out. In China, when you think of starting a factory, government is there and it would make sure that you have access to the land and road, just as they will investigate what you intend to produce to give you money at a single digit interest rate. They also give you a 10 per cent rebate on the amount of dollars you bring in. This is the model that China uses. Once you indicate interest, they ensure you have constant power supply, give you funds and give you an interest rate that is as low as three per cent. In Nigeria, the last loan I got from a bank was 27.1 per cent. Some banks even take 30 per cent. How can one survive with such interest rates? It is too devastating. Government should praise the owners of any factory that is still in operation in this country because sustaining operations in this economy gives them nightmares on a daily basis.

Good Governance Initiative

My wish is to see our country grow. I keep telling people that why I am in China or anywhere in the world is to create the good things there in Nigeria. What informed the Good Governance Initiative that focuses on steady power supply is that 80 per cent of what we use in this country comes from abroad, particularly China where steady power supply contributed to where they are today. Because they have light, wherever they find themselves, they conceive an idea, invent something and start exporting. Consequently, I said to myself that I can't be in an environment and all I do is to criticise government, let me have a non-governmental organisation through which I can convey my ideas to government. I remember engaging previous ministers of power on the need to have a steady power supply. I told them the problem does not lie in having an eight-point agenda, they should make it one point (power), which is the most paramount thing. Without power, we are wasting our time in this country. Without a steady power supply, the dollar will keep rising, exchange won't come down without a steady power supply and prices of food items won't come down without a steady power supply. Steady power supply is one of the master keys to change things in this country. I know how hardworking we are. We have the population and the brain. It is so frustrating.

The whole idea of the initiative is that I want to see what I can contribute to the country as I cannot just concentrate on the income I make from my business.

Government

They should bring out intervention funds with immediate effect. Government should locate all the genuine and committed manufacturers through the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN. Diesel can be subsidised. This will help. Also, the intervention funds should be created at a cheaper rate, a single per cent interest rate. The Bank of Industry, BOI, loan is about 18 or 20 per cent. In fact, all efforts to get a loan from BOI have been frustrated. They have taken one per cent fee from my account and have not given me the loan for five years now. They are still with my money and are saying it is non-refundable, yet they can't give me the loan. This is what so many manufacturers are passing through. I had to go to a commercial bank that gave me a loan at almost 30 per cent",vanguardngr.com,news,Vanguard,Urowayino Jeremiah,0.4901960784313726,448952884,1,https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NIDO.jpg,

At the same time, Russian electronic warfare means actively affected the Ukrainian equipment.

Mercouris emphasized that the overall depletion of the Ukrainian air defense system also contributed to the success of the Russian strikes: the Patriot and S-300 missile systems have been destroyed in large numbers by the Russian army in recent weeks.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Smith, who entered the game in the 89th minute, used his left foot to beat Colorado goalkeeper Zach Steffen into the left side of the box, carrying the Dynamo (2-1-1, seven points) to their second straight victory. Smith's shot was just the second on goal for Houston.

Dynamo goalkeeper Steve Clark was credited with two saves while recording his first shutout of the year and the 63rd of his 11-year MLS career. Clark and the Houston defense had to fend off the Rapids for five additional minutes after Smith's tally.

The Rapids (1-2-2, five points) outshot Houston 8-5 and also had just two shots on goal. Colorado is still winless in two home games this season.

The Dynamo got the game's first real scoring chance in the 22nd minute when Ibrahim Aliyu hit a right-footed shot from the center of the penalty area, but Steffen made the save.

The Rapids swung back with a Djordje Mihailovic shot on goal in the 42nd minute that forced Clark to make a stop.

After the teams exchanged yellow cards midway through the second half, Colorado's Kevin Cabral challenged Clark with a left-footed shot from the center of the box in the 66th minute, but Houston's last line of defense was up to the task.

The Mihailovic tried again to beat Clark in the 75th minute from near the same spot as Cabral, but could not get his shot past the Houston keeper.

Colorado produced its final scoring chance in the 86th minute when Jonathan Lewis had a weak attempt, and Clark gobbled it up.",islandpacket.com,news,The Island Packet,Field Level Media,0.2313725490196079,448952518,1,https://www.islandpacket.com/wps/build/images/islandpacket/facebook.jpg,

The severity of my impatience was due to house and kwaito sounds overwhelming my then youthful ears.

Avant-garde jazz was even worse -- distorted, experimental and offbeat. It was only with time -- and attending live shows -- that I began to appreciate the sensitivity, creativity and restrained power of the genre.

Watching action drama Inkabi making its world premiere on Netflix on 13 March I was reminded of jazz, with the film swinging between smooth storytelling and avant-garde filmmaking.

Viewers enter a world of contract killings, casinos and violence, set in Joburg blues and rural landscapes.

""The inkabi [hitman] underworld is one with a rich history. I have always been fascinated by this world and its characters,"" director, writer and co-producer Norman Maake tells me. ""Therefore, it felt natural to set the film in this world.""

An Afda film school alumnus who has directed films such as Love Lives Here, Piet's Sake and Soldiers of the Rock, Maake, came up with the concept for the movie in 2014.

Co-producer Zinzi Mhlongo adds that the first time she read the screenplay she knew this was a unique opportunity to delve into the complexities of our country's social and cultural landscape via this deep, dark underworld.

""It was told in a unique way which I believed would provoke meaningful conversations about the realities of life in our country,"" she says.

Hitting top 10 status on the streaming platform in its first week of release, Inkabi is already provoking debate among viewers.

Through their company, African Entertainers Consultancy, Maake and Mhlongo spent rigorous hours mulling over the details of the film.

Like my initial unfamiliarity with jazz compositions, one is tempted to switch to something else in the first few minutes of the film. But curiosity about this world of Zulu hitmen draws one in to watch every movement in each scene and patiently witness the director's vision.

Inkabi revolves around Frank (Tshamano Sebe), a retired hitman, who has chosen to start over as a private taxi driver.

He befriends Lucy (Michelle Tiren), a young Kenyan woman working at a shady downtown casino. After losing custody of her daughter, Lucy is in a downward spiral of drugs and high-class prostitution.

One night, she witnesses the murder of one of her clients, a prominent millionaire. Lucy manages to escape but the killer is after her blood. She has no one to turn to except Frank, her only friend.

Themes of justice and redemption are nothing unique. It is, however, the delving into the human side of an inkabi that grounds the film's premise.

Before, Frank only killed for money but now he must kill to protect a friend who has never had anybody to stand up for her.

Maake aimed to show how a retired hitman, forced to return to this dark world, but for a different reason, can protect and bring justice to those vulnerable in society.

Making a film in South Africa is an arduous and expensive task, compared to doing it in other parts of the world where the industry is mature.

Respect and credit are due to Maake and Mhlongo for crafting a high-quality film on a small budget in a post-Covid context.

The film is one of six micro-budget projects supported through a project funded by Netflix and the National Film and Video Foundation.

""We were fortunate to be selected as one of the six films. Although there will always be challenges, we are proud to have produced the film with the support of an amazing team of creatives,"" says Mhlongo.

She adds that despite the difficulties the South African industry continues to grow and thrive, thanks to filmmakers' resilience and creativity.

On the down side, there is a feeling that the editing and character development in Inkabi are hurried. Hence one fails to fully empathise with some of the characters.

The feeble shoot-out scenes and old men fighting also threaten to detract from the film.

Under such budget constraints, one does however commend the creators, including cinematographer, Chuanne Blofield and editor Tongai Furusa, for attempting to bring a prime-quality film to our screens.

Given that the concept of inkabi has strong Zulu cultural associations, the decision to cast a non-Zulu as the lead character was controversial. Maake says it was intentional.

The film has more than one hitman, he says, and he wanted to broaden the common perception that assassins are typically Zulus who come from rural villages in KwaZulu-Natal.

""The story of why Frank is non-Zulu is an entire film on its own -- the third film in the trilogy.""

A trilogy? Maake again compels us to be patient with the process -- or rather his process -- in allowing the puzzle pieces to fit.

In some scenes, the film explores restrained violence through the use of animation, shadows and sound.

Maake indicates that the style was informed by the crime genre, with heavy influence from the imagery of the city of Johannesburg.

""The animation was inspired by this mystical world of inkabi and its colourful, mythical nature of how they carry out a hit.

""I was also interested in what role culture and history play in the film.""

The violence scenes conjured up images of Quentin Tarantino's 2003 action movie Kill Bill: Volume 1. In a seven-minute scene about bloody revenge, he uses anime-inspired ingenuity to make the gore palatable.

Similarly, Inkabi has hints of Western tonality evocative of the 2017 South African neo-Western, Five Fingers for Marseilles.

The mix of filmmaking styles might not be everyone's cup of rooibos -- especially audiences who are used to Hollywood's high-budget, fast-paced movies.

The challenge for filmmakers thus becomes creating unconventional, yet classical, works, while appeasing mass audiences.

Maake argues that filmmakers must create the stories they want to tell. When one has relentless passion for the story, the audience will come.

""A story told from the heart is a story that will live long after its making,"" he says.

With the emergence of streaming platforms, local filmmakers have an opportunity to grow new audiences.

The audience has control over what they want to watch, says Maake and cultivating a diverse audience is important for all involved.

""I believe that we have a growing audience, and as time goes on, they will tire of stereotyped content.""

Crafted with utmost passion and proficiency for storytelling, Inkabi asks for the audience's patience to watch a local story shot through a different lens.

Maake is only scratching the surface of the potential to feed the growing appetite among film viewers for authentic African stories.

Despite a couple of flaws, Inkabi is a compelling addition to South Africa's recovering film industry. It is a victory for independent filmmakers in showing what can be achieved on a micro-budget.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Underscoring the magnitude of Oman's new green hydrogen industry, investments in the first wave of giga-scale energy projects underpinned by support utilities collectively referred to as 'common infrastructure', are expected to total between $40 - 60 billion by 2030, according to Eng Salim bin Nasser al Aufi, Minister of Energy Minerals.

The revised projections, up from previous estimates of $30 - 40 billion for the green hydrogen projects alone, point to the sizable investment that will go into the development of the common-use infrastructure, encompassing new hydrogen pipelines, transmission networks, water desalination and pipeline networks, and specialized storage capacity as well.

Addressing the 10th Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue 2024 (BETD), which took place in the German capital last week, Al Aufi said the sizable investment Oman is making towards the common-use infrastructure affirms its commitment to meeting the stringent standards set by key blocs, notably the European Union, for the import of renewable hydrogen.

""We want to build a completely new infrastructure so that we can meet all the potential standards that will come our way,"" said Al Aufi. ""In terms of investment, we are estimating that we probably will be investing between 40 to 60 billion dollars over the next five years in order to meet (our green hydrogen production target around 1 million tons per annum by 2030).""

To date, six gigawatt-scale green hydrogen projects have been signed with a number of multinational consortiums that have been allocated land blocks in Al Wusta and Dhofar Governorates. Hydrom Oman, the orchestrator of the green hydrogen industry, has also launched a new entity, provisionally named 'InfraCo', to oversee the development of the common-use infrastructure.

Given the element of ""uncertainty"" surrounding the multiplicity of standard-setting regulatory regimes likely to materialize from different markets, the Sultanate of Oman has decided to design and roll-out entirely new common infrastructure to be able to ""take on the most stringent standards"" set by importers, said Al Aufi.

""So we are not going to use the existing infrastructure; we are building completely new infrastructure, which will be completely ring-fenced from any grey power generation, grey water generation, grey ammonia generation, and so on. So it's all going to be a 100% green.""

This commitment to building out greenfield infrastructure spans not only the hydrogen pipelines, but also the renewable energy systems, power cables, desalination plants and other utilities, he said.

""All of that is to make sure that there are no standards that we cannot meet"", he said, while adding in lighter vein, ""If we are unable to meet the European standards, then those standards must be wrong!""

Part of the objective behind the plan to finance the common-use infrastructure is to mitigate the cost burden on developers investing in green hydrogen projects, said the Minister. At the same time, Oman is working with partners to explore cost-competitive and viable options for shipping renewable hydrogen, whether in the form of ammonia, liquid organic hydrogen carrier, or in some chemical form.

""In addition, we are also working at options for storage so that we can increase the efficiency of the electrolyzers and make sure that we bring the cost down, which makes our landing price as competitive as possible to Europe.""

The 3-day Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue was attended by ministers and high-ranking delegations from over 75 countries.

These agreements, valued at $66 million for the Shounter Hydropower Project and $35 million for the Jagran-IV Hydropower Project, aim to significantly enhance Pakistan's renewable energy infrastructure by adding a combined total of 70 megawatts of hydropower capacity to the national grid.

The funding will facilitate the construction of essential infrastructure, including dams, water diversion systems, powerhouses, and transmission lines, marking a significant step forward in Pakistan's transition towards sustainable energy sources.

These projects not only aim to address the environmental and financial challenges associated with conventional energy sources but also underscore the critical role of clean energy in promoting sustainable development, economic growth, and social welfare across Pakistan.

This move reinforces the SFD's long-standing commitment to supporting Pakistan's development goals, having financed 41 development projects and programs since 1976 with soft loans and grants exceeding $1.4 billion, aimed at fostering growth in various critical sectors throughout the country.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",news-gazette.com,news,The News-Gazette,Associated Press,-0.05098039215686279,448952220,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/news-gazette.com/content/tncms/custom/image/3d3bfbd4-3cf5-11ec-9461-574a9d514a20.jpg?resize=600%2C315,

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

He affirmed that India will not skirt this problem anymore and the mood in the country is not to overlook the issue of terrorism.

The EAM, who is in Singapore as part of his three-nation visit, was speaking at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore on his book 'Why Bharat Matters'.

Speaking at the event, Jaishankar said, ""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...we have been unfortunate, or ill-starred to be blessed with the one we have to our west. How do you deal with a neighbour, who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""Taking a veiled dig at Pakistan, the EAM said that in the country, terrorism exists almost at ""industry level"" and ""assembly line"".

""It's not a one-off, different countries at different points of time have experienced this. But, a very sustained, almost an industry level, assembly line...people whose job is to do bad things at night,"" he said.

Jaishankar added that India has decided that it will have to find a way to address the problem because dodging it will only invite more trouble.

""I don't have a quick, instantaneous fix, but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore...if we have a problem, we must be honest enough to face up to the problem. If you have to have those discussions, we should, if it's hard to find a solution, we must work through. We should not give the other country free pass...in India the mood is not to overlook terrorism,"" the EAM said.

""If you look at the changes that have happened in the last decade, the great deal of public anger to lack of response to terrorism threat is one factor,"" he added.

Jaishankar is on an official visit to Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia from March 23-27.

The visit will focus on enhancing bilateral relations with the three countries, and would provide an opportunity for engagement on regional issues of mutual concern, a Ministry of External Affairs release said earlier.

The Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, gave the estimate at the 2024 edition of CERAWeek, a global oil and gas event in Houston, the United States, organised by S&P Global.

The programme which ended on Friday was themed: ""Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, Climate, Technology and Geopolitics.""

Kyari argued that the main focus of the NNPC at the moment, is building capacity to deliver gas into the domestic market, reiterating that Nigeria remains a gas country with associated oil rather than the other way round.

Nigeria has over 208 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of proven gas reserves and about 600 TCF in potential reserves, but can hardly get the resource out of the ground due to lack of infrastructure and the much-needed investment in the sector.

But highlighting the ongoing conversations around energy transition, the NNPCL GCEO noted that the country takes the issue of energy availability very seriously as well as the cheapest route to explore it.

The NNPC's chief executive argued that there is now a clear opportunity that gas has today, which wasn't there 10 years ago, explaining that the NNPC and its partners are building a number of trunk lines that will supply gas within the network.

According to the GCEO, within the next three to four years, there will likely be in-country gas infrastructure to raise supply, especially domestically.

""What we see is that we will probably need between $10 billion to $15 billion in two to three years. That should cover the immediate gap. And of course, looking beyond providing gas in the domestic market, which is to see how relationships and partnerships can create gas for export.

""And of course, when you look at that, and then probably you see another incremental $10 billion to $12 billion which will create the opportunity for growth,"" he stated.

Besides, the NNPC helmsman said that there is an ongoing engagement, which has reached a very advanced stage to create a pipeline that can pass through 13 African countries into Morocco and then to Europe, estimated at $25 billion.

He mentioned the ongoing construction of the NLNG Train 7, expressing the hope that it will likely double Nigeria's current capacity in the liquefied natural gas space when completed.

""Also, we are working on two other projects. One is the fixed LNG project and we have reached an advanced stage of commitment so that we can bring back another 10 million tonnes facility in the country, and several other floating LNG projects.

""But obviously, we have a line of sight around at least three to four LNG projects. We are also engaging our partners to see how we can add another train on the LNG making it eight. We see huge opportunities,"" he pointed out.

Kyari further called for support from other countries to nations in sub-Saharan Africa, to close the energy availability gap.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.09019607843137245,448951829,1,,

Singapore: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday briefed Singapore's business community about the strides taken by India in the field of manufacture of semiconductors and appealed to them to invest in this key sector in the country. Jaishankar spoke about how machines for the manufacture of semiconductors have started coming (to India) and also how India is progressing towards establishing the first three plants for this multi-billion dollar industry.

""There is a degree of purpose and seriousness as well as investment going into manufacturing that has not been seen for a long time,"" the Minister told a 300-plus audience, mostly Singapore-based members of the business community.

He was answering questions at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of the National University of Singapore (NUS) after a lecture on his book 'Why Bharat Matters.'

""A very productive interaction with leading Singaporean Corporate figures. ... Appreciate their positive feedback on the India growth story, based on investment experiences. ... Confident that their commitment to doing more business in India will further increase,"" Jaishankar later posted on X along with some photos from the event.

Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore and reached here earlier in the day, highlighted ""a very good global manufacturing response to the Production Linked Initiative (PLI) Scheme,"" but at the same time reminded the audience that India had missed the manufacturing bus in the previous decades.

Semiconductors are an essential component in almost everything, from electronic gadgets to consumer goods and from solar panels, satellites to weapons. Currently, India imports almost 90 per cent of its requirements of semiconductors.

Combining the two primary focus areas, the 'Digital India' and 'Make In India,' the Modi government has launched 'India Semiconductor Mission' as a specialised and independent business division to enable India's emergence as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design.

Jaishankar told the investor audience about three semiconductor plants being set up in India and said, ""We have started to get machinery for semiconductors today to start to build in India.""

The manufacturing message is being taken across the country, and clearly with better logistics and better talent, he pointed out.

Jaishankar also informed the guests that the government of India has entered into agreements with the country's universities for training by modernising and tweaking engineering courses in a way in which the resources for the semiconductor industry would start to flow.

""Right now, we are actually looking at a plan which would give us in the coming years at least 85,000 new people for jobs in the semiconductor zone .... it is something which we expect to grow.""

Jaishankar elaborated on the decade spent on building a foundation and goals set for achieving target-driven economic growth saying India has set 25-year goals for itself.

""That is something which is happening, the 2030 goal, and there's a 2040 goal. And there's a 2047 goal,"" said Jaishankar, calling on people to get more invested in all these changes happening (as development progresses within these goals), and urged people to start preparing themselves for what is to come.",telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETTelecom.com,,0.1607843137254903,448951826,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108743921,imgsize-10656,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/devices/jaishankar-urges-singapores-business-community-to-invest-in-indias-semiconductor-manufacturing-sector.jpg",eng-9419512

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

USDA's new map reflects climate change impact on plant success. Hardiness zones crucial for thriving plants in evolving climates. Temperature shifts and pests challenge gardeners, requiring adaptation for successful cultivation.With the arrival of spring in North America, many people are gravitating to the gardening and landscaping section of home improvement stores, where displays are overstocked with eye-catching seed packs and benches are filled with potted annuals and perennials.

But some plants that once thrived in your yard may not flourish there now. To understand why, look to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent update of its plant hardiness zone map, which has long helped gardeners and growers figure out which plants are most likely to thrive in a given location.

Comparing the 2023 map to the previous version from 2012 clearly shows that as climate change warms the Earth, plant hardiness zones are shifting northward. On average, the coldest days of winter in our current climate, based on temperature records from 1991 through 2020, are 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) warmer than they were between 1976 and 2005.

In some areas, including the central Appalachians, northern New England and north central Idaho, winter temperatures have warmed by 1.5 hardiness zones - 15 degrees F (8.3 C) - over the same 30-year window. This warming changes the zones in which plants, whether annual or perennial, will ultimately succeed in a climate on the move.

As a plant pathologist, I have devoted my career to understanding and addressing plant health issues. Many stresses not only shorten the lives of plants, but also affect their growth and productivity.

I am also a gardener who has seen firsthand how warming temperatures, pests and disease affect my annual harvest. By understanding climate change impacts on plant communities, you can help your garden reach its full potential in a warming world.

There's no question that the temperature trend is upward. From 2014 through 2023, the world experienced the 10 hottest summers ever recorded in 174 years of climate data. Just a few months of sweltering, unrelenting heat can significantly affect plant health, especially cool-season garden crops like broccoli, carrots, radishes and kale.

Winters are also warming, and this matters for plants. The USDA defines plant hardiness zones based on the coldest average annual temperature in winter at a given location. Each zone represents a 10-degree F range, with zones numbered from 1 (coldest) to 13 (warmest). Zones are divided into 5-degree F half zones, which are lettered ""a"" (northern) or ""b"" (southern).

For example, the coldest hardiness zone in the lower 48 states on the new map, 3a, covers small pockets in the northernmost parts of Minnesota and has winter extreme temperatures of -40 F to -35 F. The warmest zone, 11b, is in Key West, Florida, where the coldest annual lows range from 45 F to 50 F.

On the 2012 map, northern Minnesota had a much more extensive and continuous zone 3a. North Dakota also had areas designated in this same zone, but those regions now have shifted completely into Canada. Zone 10b once covered the southern tip of mainland Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but has now been pushed northward by a rapidly encroaching zone 11a.

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant:

Hardiness zones matter far less for annual plants, which germinate, flower and die in a single growing season, than for perennial plants that last for several years. Annuals typically avoid the lethal winter temperatures that define plant hardiness zones.

In fact, most annual seed packs don't even list the plants' hardiness zones. Instead, they provide sowing date guidelines by geographic region. It's still important to follow those dates, which help ensure that frost-tender crops are not planted too early and that cool-season crops are not harvested too late in the year.

Many perennials can grow across wide temperature ranges. For example, hardy fig and hardy kiwifruit grow well in zones 4-8, an area that includes most of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states. Raspberries are hardy in zones 3-9, and blackberries are hardy in zones 5-9. This eliminates a lot of guesswork for most gardeners, since a majority of U.S. states are dominated by two or more of these zones.

Nevertheless, it's important to pay attention to plant tags to avoid selecting a variety or cultivar with a restricted hardiness zone over another with greater flexibility. Also, pay attention to instructions about proper sun exposure and planting dates after the last frost in your area.

Fruit trees have two parts, the rootstock and the scion wood, that are grafted together to form a single tree. Rootstocks, which consist mainly of a root system, determine the tree's size, timing of flowering and tolerance of soil-dwelling pests and pathogens. Scion wood, which supports the flowers and fruit, determines the fruit variety.

Most commercially available fruit trees can tolerate a wide range of hardiness zones. However, stone fruits like peaches, plums and cherries are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations within those zones - particularly abrupt swings in winter temperatures that create unpredictable freeze-thaw events.

These seesaw weather episodes affect all types of fruit trees, but stone fruits appear to be more susceptible, possibly because they flower earlier in spring, have fewer hardy rootstock options, or have bark characteristics that make them more vulnerable to winter injury.

Perennial plants' hardiness increases through the seasons in a process called hardening off, which conditions them for harsher temperatures, moisture loss in sun and wind, and full sun exposure. But a too-sudden autumn temperature drop can cause plants to die back in winter, an event known as winter kill. Similarly, a sudden spring temperature spike can lead to premature flowering and subsequent frost kill.

Plants aren't the only organisms constrained by temperature. With milder winters, southern insect pests and plant pathogens are expanding their ranges northward.

One example is Southern blight, a stem and root rot disease that affects 500 plant species and is caused by a fungus, Agroathelia rolfsii. It's often thought of as affecting hot Southern gardens, but has become more commonplace recently in the Northeast US on tomatoes, pumpkins and squash, and other crops, including apples in Pennsylvania.

Other plant pathogens may take advantage of milder winter temperatures, which leads to prolonged saturation of soils instead of freezing. Both plants and microbes are less active when soil is frozen, but in wet soil, microbes have an opportunity to colonize dormant perennial plant roots, leading to more disease.

It can be challenging to accept that climate change is stressing some of your garden favorites, but there are thousands of varieties of plants to suit both your interests and your hardiness zone.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",independent.co.uk,news,The Independent,,-0.06666666666666665,448951382,1,https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/24/04/Moose_Hunt_Nevada_74213.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,

Fueled by a need for speed, affordability, and cleaner options, what was once a luxury is now a common sight.

As technology raced forward, tires went from wood to rubber. In the 1800s, pneumatic tires were developed to make cars faster. When natural rubber wasn't enough to scale car production, synthetic rubber came in. Today, rubber has become a major contributor to land pollution, leading the industry to more bio and recyclable options again. Sustainability has become the next big gear shift.

Zero carbon emission cars are the future

Cars and vans rule the pollution charts, at nearly half (48%) of all transport emissions! While electric cars provide a good option for replacing fuel, extraction of lithium for lithium-ion batteries and other critical materials required for batteries has vulnerable supply chains.

Technologies such as lithiation and direct recycling will make the industry's process circular -- making new lithium-ion batteries from end-of-life ones.

Hydrogen will play a critical role in transforming transportation. Big manufacturers are close to launching hydrogen-powered vehicles, and giant investments by Reliance ($75 billion) and Adani ($70 billion) are fueling the race for clean hydrogen production.

Even TATA plans to build buses with Hydrogen fuel cell technology. Truck giant Daimler teamed up with Cummins in 2022 to test hydrogen-powered engines in Freightliner Cascadia trucks for North America.

These fuel cells would leave moisture as automobiles exhaust, making them environmentally friendly. A German aviation firm piloted the world's first liquid hydrogen-powered test flight for 3 hrs in 2023, extending this trend to the aviation sector as well.

Advanced materials will ensure that every part of the car is made from bio or recycled materials

Even with new engines, manufacturing automobile components still adds a carbon footprint. Chemicals and materials derived from petroleum products have been key ingredients, from tires to interiors. OEMs and the entire automobile supply chain network are looking for parts made from recycled or biocontent. Continental Tires, a major tire manufacturing company recently announced to have tires made from 100% recycled content by 2030. In 2022, Volvo released an electric SUV EX90, containing 50kgs of recycled plastics and bio-based materials. In 2023, BMW launched its first vehicle with all-vegan interiors, reducing carbon emissions by 85%. Autoneum recently launched a 100% recyclable carpet from recycled PET.

Cars will talk and act as our support & safety system

Imagine if vehicles could talk, share data, and warn drivers of potential blind spots or disabled vehicles or whether it's safe to enter an intersection.

Vehicle-to-X technology will make cars more connected, where X could be another vehicle, infrastructure, device, network, or even your electricity grid. HAAS Alert, a company that develops vehicle communication platforms, in January'24, showcased the world's first cross-brand car-to-car communication capabilities between Volkswagen and Stellantis vehicles. Many automobile OEMs are adding V2V tech to chat with each other, but they still need a common language to understand one another. Additionally, Electric car batteries could soon store extra energy when there's it's in surplus and then send it back to the grid to power homes during blackouts! This tech, called Vehicle to Grid (V2G), is still being tested but has much potential.

Lastly, Intelligent, sustainable cars are a close reality

Imagine your car as a super-powered learner driver, constantly taking in information and making decisions. Researchers are developing AI that uses cameras, radar, and special laser technology- LiDAR to see the road better than any human driver and make safe decisions in tough conditions like bad weather.

While many challenges remain, the transportation industry is focussing on clean energy and eco-friendly materials to fast track to a greener and safer ride. The future of transportation looks electric, sustainable, and connected!

. While Cruise is facing a temporary setback, they're still progressing. Other companies like Aurora are even looking at ways to put AI into different vehicles. The Aurora Driver is designed to enable any vehicle type, from passenger sedans to class-8 trucks, to move safely and autonomously.

He was lurking under the basket, and had leaped into the air to lay the ball up. Trimble had no fear. No hesitation. He jumped up -- almost impossibly high -- and smacked the ball right out of Kohler's hands.

Trimble got the ball back, dribbling it to the top of the arc and hesitating for a moment, clearly thinking about shooting. Instead, he dismissed the idea and lobbed the ball to Armando Bacot. A few passes later, and the ball was stolen from Davis. MSU's Tyson Walker took it down the court, gearing up for another easy lay to cut the lead to five, but again Trimble was there waiting.

This time he didn't get a hand on the ball, but his presence and uplifted arm was enough. The shot never found the net.

Fast forward a minute. Each team had made a few more baskets, and the score was 55-51, UNC. Graduate guard Cormac Ryan had just airballed a wide-open 3-point attempt in the corner. The momentum was not with the Tar Heels. On the next possession, MSU's A.J. Hoggard found the ball under the net. And like clockwork, there was Trimble, right with him. Yet again, he out-jumped the 6-foot-4 Hoggard, getting a firm palm on the rock and knocking it away, completely halting the Spartan push.

""I was like 'Thank God,""' Davis said.

From that point on, it was smooth sailing for North Carolina.

""Being a defensive presence is definitely part of my game,"" Trimble said, ""and I just take the most pride I can in it every single game.""

Despite his small stature, he's tough and can stand up to almost any player he guards -- as evidenced by his multiple blocks over the night.

""He's a strong 200 pounds,"" Ingram said. ""He should be playing football in my opinion.""

He's not though. He's playing basketball, and he's playing it well. But still, even with his defensive prowess in mind, there's one element of his game that is noticeably absent. Offensive production.

Over the course of the season, Trimble has consistently passed up wide open looks in favor of giving the ball to his teammates. Sure, coach Davis' motto of the year has been ""good to great shots"" but at some point, Trimble just has to go for it.

Even against MSU, there were a few instances where he hasn't taken an open look that could have benefitted the team. It's something that coach Davis has noticed too.

""He's always on me, HD, he's the only coach who will tell me to do more,"" Trimble said. ""I mean, he's right.""

Trimble knows he needs to start shooting. He averaged over 20 points per game in high school. Over the summer, he worked with assistant coach Jeff Lebo on improving his shot daily. It's in his bag.

""The biggest thing I think my brother helps me on is just the mental side,"" Trimble said. ""I don't think people realize how big the mental game is in the sport, so he's always on my side with that.""

It's all there. Now, the only thing left for Trimble to do is put the pieces together. And, with the Sweet 16 fast approaching, there's no better time for him to do so then now. It could be the key to North Carolina's success down the line.

And there's one person who's more than willing to give Trimble that final push -- his mom, Laurence.

China's slowing economy would impact Taiwan in the form of decreased exports, supply chain lapses and increased risk and uncertainties in terms of investing in China, a report by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) said.

The report, which was commissioned by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said that China's economic growth this year would be limited due to an internal housing bubble, exorbitant debts accrued by the corporate sector and the government, weak domestic demand, reduced investment, and heightened external uncertainties.

Taiwan should diversify its export markets, strengthen its supply chain and introduce industrial upgrades to adapt to and weather a period of sluggish Chinese economic performance, the report said.

China's economic growth rate is to drop to between 4.5 and 5 percent this year, compared with 5.2 percent last year, estimates showed.

China has inherent risks in its financial sector, stemming from increased risks of Chinese banks seeing higher bad debt from real-estate loans, which could lead to a repeat or similar incident to the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, the report said.

Although Taiwan's exports -- comprised primarily of semiconductors, electronic products and precision machinery -- to China and Hong Kong last year dropped to 35.4 percent of its total annual exports, any weakening of China's economy would impact cross-strait trade, it added.

Taiwanese businesses with production bases in China are reliant on local materials and other supplementary products, which would be greatly affected by China's economic instability, the report said, adding that electronic and machinery production would be most affected.

China's economic instability would also directly increase Taiwanese businesspeople's risk when considering investments, it said.

China is expected to be caught in a middle-income trap that would see an extended period of slowed economy, while industrial autonomy and other policies are expected to impact the Taiwanese economy on multiple fronts, the report said.",taipeitimes.com,news,Taipei Times,,-0.403921568627451,448951065,1,https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/03/24/P02-240324-306.jpg,

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,-0.05098039215686279,448950992,1,https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:N2E5YzRmN2YtMDAzNi00:ZTg3NjQ3/landscape/1280,

Pedestrians, who often found themselves navigating around unsightly and unhygienic piles of dog faeces, have been vocal about the need for action.

The Department of Animal Husbandry has issued a notice highlighting the importance of dog owners taking accountability for their pets' waste. Dog owners are now required to carry cleaning bags whenever they take their furry companions for a walk. This simple measure is expected to significantly reduce the amount of dog waste left behind on footpaths and roads.

It's not just about aesthetics; it's about public health too. Dog waste can harbour harmful bacteria and parasites, posing a risk to both humans and other animals. By promptly disposing of dog waste, pet owners can help mitigate these health hazards and contribute to a safer community.

The decision to enforce stricter regulations comes as a response to the increasing complaints from residents about the lack of cleanliness in public areas. By making dog owners responsible for cleaning up after their pets, authorities hope to promote a cleaner and more hygienic environment for everyone in Bengaluru.",newsable.asianetnews.com,news,Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,,0.003921568627450966,448950823,1,https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/ebfef553-2099-49e4-99b5-486bc364e3f4/image.jpg,eng-9417392

To an extent, Draymond Green agrees with his good friend, but the 34-year-old shares some more reasons for why the Warriors won.

""That to a certain degree is very true,"" Green said on The Draymond Green Show. ""I think we definitely had a higher IQ at the time. But I think it's more than just a higher IQ though, we had a higher IQ, for sure, but it's also IQ in the moment, in these situations.""

Green claims you can have a higher IQ but the moment can still get a bit too big for you.

""You get in these playoffs sometimes and this is the NBA Finals we're talking about, sometimes those lights can get a little bit brighter than you expected,"" Green continued. ""And then they were much younger, had never been there. Had been to the Eastern Conference Finals, but had never been there. So, I think our basketball IQ was higher. I think at that time also, our coaching staff's basketball IQ was higher, the adjustments that we made throughout that series, it made all the difference,""

(starts at 1:02 mark):

Green thinks the team and their coaching staff's higher IQ and experience of having been on that big stage previously played a big part. The Warriors, of course, had made the NBA Finals in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 prior to that season.

For the Celtics, meanwhile, it was the first trip in the Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown era. They went up 2-1 in the series and led in the fourth quarter of Game 4, but crumbled down the stretch to lose. The Warriors would then win the next two games as well, to win the series in six games.

Green struggled mightily at the start of the series but came into his own at the end. He finished with averages of 6.2 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game in the Finals to win his fourth NBA championship.

Tatum admitted later the Warriors were mentally tougher than the Celtics in the Finals and that it was a hard pill for him to swallow. With that experience now under their belts, though, you would expect the Celtics to handle the moment better should they make it back to the biggest stage.

What Did LeBron James Say?

On his podcast, LeBron was stressing about the importance of basketball IQ and stated that it is what separates teams when you get to the Conference Finals and the NBA Finals. It was then, that he brought up the 2022 NBA Finals.

""I believe that when Golden State beat Boston, it came down to IQ in the Finals,"" LeBron said. ""Because Boston, to me, had the better talent. Boston had the better talent. But it came down to IQ. People say experience - IQ.""

(starts at 34:47 mark):

While making that admission about the Warriors being mentally tougher, Tatum had said he felt the teams were evenly matched from a talent standpoint. James did not feel that was the case and thought it came down to one team having a higher basketball IQ.

In a statement, the foundation said it welcomed a government move to contribute to the costs of expanding the terminal at the port of Cuxhaven, on the North Sea coast.

The government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal, together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), a government spokesperson said on Saturday.

""The expansion of the Cuxhaven port is a central project for the expansion of renewable energies,"" said Stefan Wenzel, parliamentary state secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

The German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation estimates that up to 200 hectares of additional heavy-duty area will be required by the end of the decade just for the construction of new offshore wind farms.

But some plants that once thrived in your yard may not flourish there now. To understand why, look to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent update of its plant hardiness zone map, which has long helped gardeners and growers figure out which plants are most likely to thrive in a given location.

Comparing the 2023 map to the previous version from 2012 clearly shows that as climate change warms the Earth, plant hardiness zones are shifting northward. On average, the coldest days of winter in our current climate, based on temperature records from 1991 through 2020, are 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) warmer than they were between 1976 and 2005.

In some areas, including the central Appalachians, northern New England and north central Idaho, winter temperatures have warmed by 1.5 hardiness zones - 15 degrees F (8.3 C) - over the same 30-year window. This warming changes the zones in which plants, whether annual or perennial, will ultimately succeed in a climate on the move.

As a plant pathologist, I have devoted my career to understanding and addressing plant health issues. Many stresses not only shorten the lives of plants, but also affect their growth and productivity.

I am also a gardener who has seen firsthand how warming temperatures, pests and disease affect my annual harvest. By understanding climate change impacts on plant communities, you can help your garden reach its full potential in a warming world.

There's no question that the temperature trend is upward. From 2014 through 2023, the world experienced the 10 hottest summers ever recorded in 174 years of climate data. Just a few months of sweltering, unrelenting heat can significantly affect plant health, especially cool-season garden crops like broccoli, carrots, radishes and kale.

Winters are also warming, and this matters for plants. The USDA defines plant hardiness zones based on the coldest average annual temperature in winter at a given location. Each zone represents a 10-degree F range, with zones numbered from 1 (coldest) to 13 (warmest). Zones are divided into 5-degree F half zones, which are lettered ""a"" (northern) or ""b"" (southern).

For example, the coldest hardiness zone in the lower 48 states on the new map, 3a, covers small pockets in the northernmost parts of Minnesota and has winter extreme temperatures of -40 F to -35 F. The warmest zone, 11b, is in Key West, Florida, where the coldest annual lows range from 45 F to 50 F.

On the 2012 map, northern Minnesota had a much more extensive and continuous zone 3a. North Dakota also had areas designated in this same zone, but those regions now have shifted completely into Canada. Zone 10b once covered the southern tip of mainland Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but has now been pushed northward by a rapidly encroaching zone 11a.

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant:

Hardiness zones matter far less for annual plants, which germinate, flower and die in a single growing season, than for perennial plants that last for several years. Annuals typically avoid the lethal winter temperatures that define plant hardiness zones.

In fact, most annual seed packs don't even list the plants' hardiness zones. Instead, they provide sowing date guidelines by geographic region. It's still important to follow those dates, which help ensure that frost-tender crops are not planted too early and that cool-season crops are not harvested too late in the year.

Many perennials can grow across wide temperature ranges. For example, hardy fig and hardy kiwifruit grow well in zones 4-8, an area that includes most of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states. Raspberries are hardy in zones 3-9, and blackberries are hardy in zones 5-9. This eliminates a lot of guesswork for most gardeners, since a majority of U.S. states are dominated by two or more of these zones.

Nevertheless, it's important to pay attention to plant tags to avoid selecting a variety or cultivar with a restricted hardiness zone over another with greater flexibility. Also, pay attention to instructions about proper sun exposure and planting dates after the last frost in your area.

Fruit trees have two parts, the rootstock and the scion wood, that are grafted together to form a single tree. Rootstocks, which consist mainly of a root system, determine the tree's size, timing of flowering and tolerance of soil-dwelling pests and pathogens. Scion wood, which supports the flowers and fruit, determines the fruit variety.

Most commercially available fruit trees can tolerate a wide range of hardiness zones. However, stone fruits like peaches, plums and cherries are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations within those zones - particularly abrupt swings in winter temperatures that create unpredictable freeze-thaw events.

These seesaw weather episodes affect all types of fruit trees, but stone fruits appear to be more susceptible, possibly because they flower earlier in spring, have fewer hardy rootstock options, or have bark characteristics that make them more vulnerable to winter injury.

Perennial plants' hardiness increases through the seasons in a process called hardening off, which conditions them for harsher temperatures, moisture loss in sun and wind, and full sun exposure. But a too-sudden autumn temperature drop can cause plants to die back in winter, an event known as winter kill. Similarly, a sudden spring temperature spike can lead to premature flowering and subsequent frost kill.

Plants aren't the only organisms constrained by temperature. With milder winters, southern insect pests and plant pathogens are expanding their ranges northward.

One example is Southern blight, a stem and root rot disease that affects 500 plant species and is caused by a fungus, Agroathelia rolfsii. It's often thought of as affecting hot Southern gardens, but has become more commonplace recently in the Northeast US on tomatoes, pumpkins and squash, and other crops, including apples in Pennsylvania.

Other plant pathogens may take advantage of milder winter temperatures, which leads to prolonged saturation of soils instead of freezing. Both plants and microbes are less active when soil is frozen, but in wet soil, microbes have an opportunity to colonize dormant perennial plant roots, leading to more disease.

It can be challenging to accept that climate change is stressing some of your garden favorites, but there are thousands of varieties of plants to suit both your interests and your hardiness zone. Growing plants is an opportunity to admire their flexibility and the features that enable many of them to thrive in a world of change.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Smith, who entered the game in the 89th minute, used his left foot to beat Colorado goalkeeper Zach Steffen into the left side of the box, carrying the Dynamo (2-1-1, seven points) to their second straight victory. Smith's shot was just the second on goal for Houston.

Dynamo goalkeeper Steve Clark was credited with two saves while recording his first shutout of the year and the 63rd of his 11-year MLS career. Clark and the Houston defense had to fend off the Rapids for five additional minutes after Smith's tally.

The Rapids (1-2-2, five points) outshot Houston 8-5 and also had just two shots on goal. Colorado is still winless in two home games this season.

The Dynamo got the game's first real scoring chance in the 22nd minute when Ibrahim Aliyu hit a right-footed shot from the center of the penalty area, but Steffen made the save.

The Rapids swung back with a Djordje Mihailovic shot on goal in the 42nd minute that forced Clark to make a stop.

After the teams exchanged yellow cards midway through the second half, Colorado's Kevin Cabral challenged Clark with a left-footed shot from the center of the box in the 66th minute, but Houston's last line of defense was up to the task.

The Mihailovic tried again to beat Clark in the 75th minute from near the same spot as Cabral, but could not get his shot past the Houston keeper.

If any of Terry's teammates understand how to bounce back from difficult days, it's the fifth-year point guard who has played himself into the conversation for the NBA's Most Improved Player Award.

""Coby White is really a guy that showed me that you could be at the bottom and come right back up,"" Terry said.

After being selected with the 18th pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, Terry appeared in only 214 minutes as a rookie. He surpassed 500 minutes in Saturday's 124-113 home loss to the Boston Celtics, with only 11 contests remaining in the Bulls' regular season.

White, however, also has helped Terry with that.

""He's always preached to me that I'm nice,"" Terry said. ""I tell him he's nice. He tells me I'm nice. It's just certain things that when your teammates are giving you certain levels of confidence, you just go with it.""

Lately, the 6-foot-7 swingman is providing positive minutes for the injury-ravaged Bulls, showing his versatility in the process. Terry scored 12 points with three rebounds, one assist and one steal in 20 minutes off the bench. It was a modest but encouraging performance when coupled with the 17-minute effort Terry supplied in Thursday's road loss to the Houston Rockets.

In both contests, Terry appeared more comfortable than ever. And it's the flashes of improvement he's showing that offer compelling evidence that he is finding his way.

""He's taking advantage of his opportunities,"" White said. ""I feel like this whole season, whenever he's gotten an opportunity, he's been ready and he's taken advantage of it. He's playing with a lot of energy. He's playing with ultra confidence.

""It's not a surprise. He works hard every day. A lot of respect to him and his game. When you're in that type of position, you've just got to stay ready for your moment. And the last couple of weeks, he's been ready.""

Terry's energy always jumps out. He battled for offensive rebounds in the first quarter, securing one and crashing hard before hitting the deck trying to squeeze another. But the way Terry is playing more under control has become equally noticeable.

Terry finished two smooth, driving layups in traffic in the opening quarter. You don't have to go back to last season to find tape of Terry struggling with such finishes. He was erratic even at the start of this season. Terry said he simply read the flow of the game on both layups Saturday. Bulls coach Billy Donovan credited him for improving details of his game like that.

""He's always had a great motor. He's a great competitor. But sometimes you need more than that,"" Donovan said. ""And I think what he's done is he's been a lot more detailed in some of those areas. That's helped him.""

Terry also pointed to a shift in his mindset.

""It's all mental,"" he said. ""It's all just blocking out the noise and trusting yourself. Just keep faith. Keep believing in what you're going to achieve.""

Terry's 3-point shot remains a work in progress. He made 1 of 3 attempts Saturday but has connected on only 24.1 percent on 1.2 attempts per game this season. He's taking them with confidence. But he knows this is a results-based business.

""I definitely think I'm making some good progress,"" Terry said. ""I still just got to keep making shots. But I'm a lot more confident in it.""

As the season has worn on and Terry has filled in for a host of injured teammates, he seems to be more aware of when and how he can make an impact. The Bulls are allowing Terry to orchestrate the offense, serve as a screen-setter, play along the baseline and fly around defensively. His instincts, meanwhile, helped him throw down an emphatic two-handed dunk off a DeMar DeRozan missed jumper late in the third quarter. And he sprinted down the sideline to flush a dunk over Celtics guard Derrick White early in the fourth.

The dunk over White earned Terry a technical foul.

""He said I was on the rim too long,"" Terry said of what an official told him.

But at the tail end of his second season, Terry is starting to prove he can contribute.

""I think he continues to get better,"" Donovan said. ""He works hard, and he's pretty driven. And I think that's always a good combination in terms of guys' growth.""",theathletic.com,news,The Athletic,Darnell Mayberry,0.2549019607843137,448950134,1,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/03/24000816/USATSI_22851339-scaled-e1711253318717.jpg,

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) yesterday announced the second cohort of communities selected as part of the Communities Local Energy Action Program (Communities LEAP), a unique technical assistance initiative designed to help disadvantaged communities and those with historical ties to fossil fuel industries take direct control of their clean energy future. The 30 selected communities will receive a total of $18 million worth of technical assistance to create tailored community-wide action plans that reduce local air pollution, increase energy resilience, lower utility costs and energy burdens, and create good paying jobs.

""Under the Biden-Harris Administration, communities that have been overburdened and underserved for far too long can now leverage the federal tools needed to bring their clean energy future to life,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. ""Through in-depth, customized technical assistance, Communities LEAP helps give local governments, Tribes, and community-based organizations an extra boost to further their progress of actionable plans that lower costs while protecting the health and safety of all residents.""

Communities LEAP, which first launched in September 2021 as a pilot initiative, reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's priorities to assist community-led transitions to a clean energy economy, and to build a healthier, more equitable, and sustainable future.  Communities LEAP also implements the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 commitment, which aims to ensure that federal agencies deliver at least 40% of benefits from certain investments to disadvantaged communities and advances the work of the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities, which focuses on delivering federal investments to hard-hit energy communities.

The 30 selected applicants will work with DOE and its network of technical assistance providers, as well as local coalition partners, including local and tribal governments, community-based organizations, utilities, environmental justice, economic development, and equitable investment organizations to develop roadmaps that utilize clean energy as a tool for economic development.

The second cohort of LEAP communities will pursue areas of interest including, but not limited to:

""We are so grateful to the Biden-Harris Administration for continuing to invest in Alabama's Black Belt,"" said Representative Terri A. Sewell (AL-07). ""Every community deserves clean air and good paying jobs. As we transition to a clean energy future, this program will help ensure that the people of the Black Belt are not left behind.""

""Technical Assistance is vital to develop resilient sophisticated renewable energy projects that can support the specific needs of low resourced, vulnerable communities. Yet that very same technical assistance is often out of reach for these low resourced communities,"" said C. P. Smith, Executive Director at the Cooperativa Hidroeléctrica de la Montaña in Puerto Rico. ""We are honored to be selected for the Communities LEAP program to allow our team to leap to the next level of the energy project development process to provide cost-effective and resilient energy from renewable sources to the residents in the Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico.""

""The DOE has been outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry into clean energy for communities - like ours - that have been disproportionately energy-burdened, yet often have the most difficulty accessing resources to address those burdens,"" said Marvin Lim, Executive Director of the Lucky Shoals Community Association in Norcross, GA. ""We're eager to participate in Communities LEAP to build on the work we've done, including through previous DOE engagement, to expand our workforce training of minority entrepreneurs/laborers, to be able to perform much-needed clean energy work right where they live.""",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,,0.5137254901960784,448950071,1,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rooftop-Solar-Panels-Florida.jpeg,

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.

A sophisticated dish made with fish would add some variety to outdoor cooking. Food coordinator and outdoor cook Nahoko Minakuchi recommends an easy appetizer of lightly smoked sashimi.

In recent years, more and more people have enjoyed making smoked food. I am eager to try it, and since I am a bit concerned about the smell, I would prefer doing it outdoors. However, the preparation and cleanup of cooking tools along with how long it takes to cook seem daunting.

""There are smoked fish dishes that can be done in a short time,"" Minakuchi said. ""Sashimi can be easily infused with a light smoky flavor.""

One tool to cook the dish is a small piece of outdoor cookware called a mess tin, which allows heat and smoke to circulate efficiently. It can be found at 100 yen shops and other retailers.

""Removing the smell of smoke from cooking utensils can be challenging, even after washing them. Using inexpensive tools dedicated to smoking food might be a good idea,"" Minakuchi said.

Both the mesh to use in the mess tin and the smoke chips are also available at 100 yen shops.

You can cook smoked sashimi with your choice of fish. I chose sea bream and shime-saba, which is salt and vinegar marinated mackerel. I prepared blocks of sea bream and shime-saba fillets and cut them into three sections that also fit inside the mess tin.

To cook, line the inside of the mess tin with aluminum foil, line the bottom with the smoking chips, then place a cooking wire rack inside. The amount of chips should be just enough to not touch the rack. Heat the mess tin over low to medium heat until smoke begins to waft, then place the fish on the rack. Wrap the lid of the mess tin with aluminum foil, placing it slightly askew before turning off the heat. This method allows heat and smoke to circulate inside the mess tin, enabling the fish to be smoked in a short time. Adjust how long you smoke the fish to your preference.

Infused with the fragrance of wood, the smoky aroma permeates through the nose with each bite. The sea bream meat becomes tender, and the mackerel's vinegar flavor is softened, making both easy to eat. They are best enjoyed paired with sake or white wine.

A mixture of hojicha roasted green tea and coarse sugar, such as zarame, can be used instead of smoking chips. ""Hojicha is utilized for its aroma, while sugar aids in producing more smoke,"" Minakuchi said.

She also shared post-cooking tips: Extinguish smoldering chips by soaking them in water; tar created on the mess tin from the smoke can be removed with a melamine sponge. When cooking indoors, ensure the room is well-ventilated.

13:00 JST, March 24, 2024

Open what appears to be a carton of cigarettes, and you will find sticks of green tea powder.

""Chabacco,"" a portmanteau of ""cha,"" or tea and tobacco, was developed by Shota Morikawa, 40, who founded Showtime Inc. in 2015 based on the idea of ""chakasu,"" or ""'tea'-sing"" society. ""I wanted to offer laughter through green tea and fill the word with green tea,"" Morikawa said, smiling. The product name also plays on the word ""chabako,"" a box to store tea leaves.

The packaging of Chabacco products sold in Shizuoka Prefecture features imagery of green tea plantations and Mt. Fuji. Each pack carries a humorous notice parodying the health warnings printed on cigarette packs: ""The flavor of Chabacco may have positive effects on the mood of people around you, especially your family, colleagues and business clients.""

The product contains eight green tea powder sticks, and prices vary depending on the grade of tea, ranging from ¥500 to ¥1,000. Morikawa chose powder sticks because they are easy to carry and can be enjoyed by simply dissolving the powder in cold or hot water.

Tea leaves used for Chabacco include those grown with the chagusaba farming method, which was designated as a globally important agricultural heritage system in 2013. A variety of teas are available from the product lineup, such as fukamushicha deep-steamed tea, hojicha roasted green tea and matcha.

Chabacco is available at facilities where a strong demand for souvenirs is expected, such as train stations, michi-no-eki roadside facilities and expressway service areas. Some places stock the products inside old tobacco vending machines. The product has grown into a hit, with more than 10,000 units being sold a year at major hubs in Shizuoka Prefecture such as Shizuoka Station.

Hailing from Fukuroi of the same prefecture, Morikawa previously worked for an advertising agency in Tokyo and led a life unrelated to green tea.

However, while traveling in the United States, he was surprised when an American was elated after Morikawa gifted them green tea as a souvenir. He had also heard green tea farmers in Kakegawa, also in the prefecture, lamenting that fewer and fewer people are drinking tea.

Morikawa, wanting to bridge this gap and contribute to his hometown's green tea production, founded Showtime with the goal of creating a new product that could cultivate new demand.

The main target of the product is young people, who are said to be breaking away from green tea consumption. ""When I founded the company, there were few green tea products targeting young people. I felt that the green tea industry was breaking away from young people, rather than the opposite,"" Morikawa recalled.

Young people were amused by Chabacco, surprised thath the packs contain tea, not tobacco and began buying the product, just as he anticipated. It also drew attention on social media and is now sold in 30 different prefectures including Tokyo. Morikawa uses as many locally produced green tea leaves as possible and the packaging varies based on where it is sold. For instance, in Kagoshima Prefecture, a pack of Chabacco depicts the prefecture-native and nobleman Takamori Saigo.

Morikawa says his business is steadily expanding: An increasing number of companies are eyeing Chabacco for its novel potential for attracting people's attention. Many have been ordering custom units of Chabacco as promotional products for their firms.

""I would like to offer an opportunity for young people to get to know the culture of green tea. I hope the product makes them curious about how delicious tea prepared with a kyusu teapot could be, and why powdered tea is so good,"" Morikawa said.",japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,news,japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,,0.2549019607843137,448949977,1,https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11078194.jpg,eng-9420879
8044487638,eng,False,2024-03-24,04:19:31,2024-03-24T04:19:31Z,2024-03-24T04:17:00Z,news,0.0,https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/climate/what-climate-change-zealots-refuse-to-listen-to/,What Climate Change Zealots Refuse To Listen To | Armstrong Economics,"Milutin Milanković was a Serbian geophysicist and astronomer who, in the 1920s, calculated what has become known as the Milankovitch Cycle, describing the collective effects of changes in the Earth's movements on its climate millions of years. He hypothesized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession combined, creating cyclical variations in the intra-annual and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation on the Earth's surface. This cycle has greatly influenced climate, resulting in major climatic patterns.

The Axil Precession goes back to the ancients' observations. The Maya discovered this movement because when they built a temple, they aligned with the stars only to discover that the stars had moved. The Earth's axis of rotation, known as the Precession of the Equinox, was calculated to have a period of about 25,700 years. I believe the accuracy of the Economic Confidence Model frequency 8.6 is a source derived from this movement of the Earth itself. The calculations I ran further refined that approximation of 25,700 years to 25,800 years of 3 x 8.6.

I believe that the 100,000-cycle may actually be 95,852 years in length. Milankovitch believed that the angle of the Earth's axial tilt had the greatest effect on climate and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes. Therefore, he concluded that there was a 41,000-year period of ice ages. However, in Science back in 1976, Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton published ""Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages. For 500,000 years, major climatic changes have followed variations in obliquity and precession. Their work asserted that 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years were involved, which have impacted the ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last million years. This most likely might be refined at 43,000 (8.6 /2). Their work confirmed the hypothesis proposed decades earlier by astronomer Milutin Milankovitch.

Some have been arguing that since this Milankovitch Cycle predicts that we should be getting colder, while it has been getting warmer since 1970 when the scientists were predicting an ice age was coming, this is all because of CO2 and Methane gas. They blame farming that cuts down trees, adding CO2 to the atmosphere, and in Asia, rice farming produces methane. Throw in cars, and we are doomed thanks to the Industrial Revolution, where we should somehow return to the Stone Age. This is why there are some cheering nuclear war in hopes of reducing the population by 50%.

They REFUSE to look at the sun's beating between solar maximum and minimum. They only want to take the data that supports their predetermined conclusion -- kill 50% of the population to save the planet. The peak in the solar cycle tends to correlate with the major turning points in the war cycle. Extending the 11-year solar cycle back in time even brings us to the fall of Rome.

There is a correlation between solar activity and volcanoes. VEI is a logaritmic scale, so to create the same impact of one VEI 7, you need 10 VEI 6, 100 VEI 5, 10,000 VEI 4 or 100,000 VEI3. Volcanoes not only throw up dust that deflects the sun's energy, which Bill Gates wanted to shoot up particles to permanently block the sun, but the higher the explosion also shoots ash much higher into the atmosphere, and a VEI 5+ may reach the stratosphere. Consequently, the impact of a VEI 5 would occur every 12 years and a VEI 9 only once every 27,000 years. This is what causes the big mass extinctions that appear to be cycles of multiples of 31.4 million years following Pi.

Evidence suggests that volcanic winters occur during the Solar Minimum and have caused events like the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), which was a VEI7. This eruption was probably the largest since the 6th century AD, producing devastation between 535 and 536 AD. It is believed that the year without a summer was probably enhanced due to the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines, which was VEI4. Even just taking the 1814 and 536 events, dividing that by 8.6 and dividing that results again by 8.6 brings us to 17.2, which is twice the 8.6 frequency.

Even looking at historical records, we find that major volcanic eruptions have brought down empires. It is assumed that Thera (Santorini) erupted between 1600 and 1700 BC, which destroyed the Minoan Empire. Then, the Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD was probably the most famous of all eruptions.

Emperor Titus rushed to open the Coliseum after Pompeii's destruction. We can date his coin to 80AD since he was granted the Vonsulship VIII for that year. This was one way of trying to change the mood, much like rushing to open the Empire State Building during the Great Depression, to demonstrate that things would be getting better.

Additionally, Titus devoted much of his silver coinage of Atonement to the gods for the disaster of Pompeii. There were four main Atonement issues commemorating the services of prayer and propitiation through which the emperor attempted to address the public alarm over the disaster. People often attributed such events to the gods being angry. The coinage showed emblems seeking the approval of Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, and the deceased former Emperors to watch over the Roman people.

The Huns began a migration Eastward because of droughts, but by 430-450AD, Asia had a severe drought. especially under King Attila, made frequent and devastating raids into the Eastern Roman Empire. There appear to have been droughts in Asia, which inspired them to move East. Asia has been prone to megadroughts that have lasted more than 1000 years. Central Asia today is cyclically moving back toward a drought. The year 2021 was a major drought in the region, and this has historically caused migrations. In fact, it has been called the worst drought on record.

In 451, they invaded the Western Roman province of Gaul, where they fought a combined army of Romans and Visigoths at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields in 452 AD. What the mass migration brought was Malaria, which devastated Europe in 450AD. Nobody formally knows where the Huns came from. It is believed that they may have been the cause of the building of the Great Wall of China. The Huns came into Europe's history when, in 370AD, they crossed the Volga River and conquered the Alans. Two years later, they attacked the Ostrogoths, an eastern tribe of Germanic Goths.

By 376, the Huns had attacked the Visigoths, who then sought sanctuary within the Roman Empire. As the Huns conquered the Goths and Visigoths, they became barbarians uninterested in culture. By 395 AD, they began invading the Roman Empire and were at the gates of Rome by 410 AD. They did not appear to have issued coinage until they invaded Europe.

However, evidence has been uncovered worldwide that the early Dark Ages of the 6th century AD was most likely triggered by the eruption around 535/536 AD, which was probably a VEI7+ event. The Roman historian Procopius (c. 500 - 565AD) recorded in 536AD in his account of the wars with the Vandals, ""During this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness... and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear."" Numerous accounts from Ireland to China describe this major event.

This cataclysmic phenomenon occurred at the peak of the Economic Confidence Model Wave #762 (532-540AD), which was 536.55 (July 19/20). It has long been believed that the eruption was from Ilopango in El Salvador. There was probably a second eruption, perhaps in Indonesia, and it may have been Krakatoa. This volcanic explosion altered the world and even changed religion. Justinian I's (527 -565AD) nearly lost his throne during the January 13, 532AD Nika riots, and another conspiracy against the emperor's life by dissatisfied entrepreneurs was discovered as late as 562AD. Justinian was struck by the plague in the early 540s thanks to the eruption of 536AD and the malnutrition spread of the plague. However, he recovered, but his wife Theodora died in 548AD. This event created such major political unrest, economic decline, and social changes that few people have ever bothered to connect the dots.

There was a major volcanic explosion that was equal to more than 2000 Hiroshima-sized bombs. Human civilization was altered from the Mayan to Mongolia in the north to Constantinople and Southeast Asia. What unfolded were plagues, famine, death, and great migration, which caused people to move south. Empires and city-states collapsed, including Teotihuacan in Mexico and the Anglo-Saxon victory over the Celts and invasions, contributing to Islam's rise. Even in India, the Gupta Empire (319-550AD) of Northern India collapsed by 543AD as the Huns overran it during the mid-6th century.

The devastation to agriculture lowered the economic growth, and by 602AD, the army in Byzantium revolted, overthrowing the government and installing Phocas, who became a spokesman for dissatisfied soldiers. When the army revolted in 602AD, the revolt successfully captured Constantinople on November 23rd, 602. Phocas declared himself emperor on the same day. The Sasanian Empire (224-651 AD) in Persia peaked during the 6th century and ended by 651 AD. This was all set in motion by the volcanic winter. The political, economic, and religious changes that occurred because of this devastating 6th-century volcanic winter were profound. According to the traditional account, the Islamic prophet Muhammad began receiving what Muslims consider divine revelations in 610 AD.

The last solar wave, Solar Wave #24, reached Solar Maximum in April 2014. Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych fled Ukraine on February 22nd, 2014, going into solar maximum. We are in Solar Wave #25 and are approaching solar maximum, ideally by January 2025. This will probably also enhance rising civil unrest globally. We will then turn it down into Solar Minimum, which should peak between 2030-2032. Therefore, this rise in magnetic storms and gamma rays may cause major volcanic eruptions. This could easily result in a cold period that could be increased in amplitude by volcanic eruptions.

These insane climate zealots are attacking farming when this is the time we should be stockpiling food, just as Joseph warned the Pharoah. But they do not believe in cycles, God, or nature - just their own arrogance.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

But some plants that once thrived in your yard may not flourish there now. To understand why, look to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent update of its plant hardiness zone map, which has long helped gardeners and growers figure out which plants are most likely to thrive in a given location.

Comparing the 2023 map to the previous version from 2012 clearly shows that as climate change warms the Earth, plant hardiness zones are shifting northward. On average, the coldest days of winter in our current climate, based on temperature records from 1991 through 2020, are 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) warmer than they were between 1976 and 2005.

In some areas, including the central Appalachians, northern New England and north central Idaho, winter temperatures have warmed by 1.5 hardiness zones - 15 degrees F (8.3 C) - over the same 30-year window. This warming changes the zones in which plants, whether annual or perennial, will ultimately succeed in a climate on the move.

As a plant pathologist, I have devoted my career to understanding and addressing plant health issues. Many stresses not only shorten the lives of plants, but also affect their growth and productivity.

I am also a gardener who has seen firsthand how warming temperatures, pests and disease affect my annual harvest. By understanding climate change impacts on plant communities, you can help your garden reach its full potential in a warming world.

There's no question that the temperature trend is upward. From 2014 through 2023, the world experienced the 10 hottest summers ever recorded in 174 years of climate data. Just a few months of sweltering, unrelenting heat can significantly affect plant health, especially cool-season garden crops like broccoli, carrots, radishes and kale.

Winters are also warming, and this matters for plants. The USDA defines plant hardiness zones based on the coldest average annual temperature in winter at a given location. Each zone represents a 10-degree F range, with zones numbered from 1 (coldest) to 13 (warmest). Zones are divided into 5-degree F half zones, which are lettered ""a"" (northern) or ""b"" (southern).

For example, the coldest hardiness zone in the lower 48 states on the new map, 3a, covers small pockets in the northernmost parts of Minnesota and has winter extreme temperatures of -40 F to -35 F. The warmest zone, 11b, is in Key West, Florida, where the coldest annual lows range from 45 F to 50 F.

On the 2012 map, northern Minnesota had a much more extensive and continuous zone 3a. North Dakota also had areas designated in this same zone, but those regions now have shifted completely into Canada. Zone 10b once covered the southern tip of mainland Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but has now been pushed northward by a rapidly encroaching zone 11a.

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant: Hardiness zones matter far less for annual plants, which germinate, flower and die in a single growing season, than for perennial plants that last for several years. Annuals typically avoid the lethal winter temperatures that define plant hardiness zones.

In fact, most annual seed packs don't even list the plants' hardiness zones. Instead, they provide sowing date guidelines by geographic region. It's still important to follow those dates, which help ensure that frost-tender crops are not planted too early and that cool-season crops are not harvested too late in the year.

Many perennials can grow across wide temperature ranges. For example, hardy fig and hardy kiwifruit grow well in zones 4-8, an area that includes most of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states. Raspberries are hardy in zones 3-9, and blackberries are hardy in zones 5-9. This eliminates a lot of guesswork for most gardeners, since a majority of U.S. states are dominated by two or more of these zones.

Nevertheless, it's important to pay attention to plant tags to avoid selecting a variety or cultivar with a restricted hardiness zone over another with greater flexibility. Also, pay attention to instructions about proper sun exposure and planting dates after the last frost in your area.

Fruit trees have two parts, the rootstock and the scion wood, that are grafted together to form a single tree. Rootstocks, which consist mainly of a root system, determine the tree's size, timing of flowering and tolerance of soil-dwelling pests and pathogens. Scion wood, which supports the flowers and fruit, determines the fruit variety.

Most commercially available fruit trees can tolerate a wide range of hardiness zones. However, stone fruits like peaches, plums and cherries are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations within those zones - particularly abrupt swings in winter temperatures that create unpredictable freeze-thaw events.

These seesaw weather episodes affect all types of fruit trees, but stone fruits appear to be more susceptible, possibly because they flower earlier in spring, have fewer hardy rootstock options, or have bark characteristics that make them more vulnerable to winter injury.

Perennial plants' hardiness increases through the seasons in a process called hardening off, which conditions them for harsher temperatures, moisture loss in sun and wind, and full sun exposure. But a too-sudden autumn temperature drop can cause plants to die back in winter, an event known as winter kill. Similarly, a sudden spring temperature spike can lead to premature flowering and subsequent frost kill.

Plants aren't the only organisms constrained by temperature. With milder winters, southern insect pests and plant pathogens are expanding their ranges northward.

One example is Southern blight, a stem and root rot disease that affects 500 plant species and is caused by a fungus, Agroathelia rolfsii. It's often thought of as affecting hot Southern gardens, but has become more commonplace recently in the Northeast US on tomatoes, pumpkins and squash, and other crops, including apples in Pennsylvania.

Other plant pathogens may take advantage of milder winter temperatures, which leads to prolonged saturation of soils instead of freezing. Both plants and microbes are less active when soil is frozen, but in wet soil, microbes have an opportunity to colonize dormant perennial plant roots, leading to more disease.

It can be challenging to accept that climate change is stressing some of your garden favorites, but there are thousands of varieties of plants to suit both your interests and your hardiness zone. Growing plants is an opportunity to admire their flexibility and the features that enable many of them to thrive in a world of change. (The Conversation) RUP RUP

Smith, who entered the game in the 89th minute, used his left foot to beat Colorado goalkeeper Zach Steffen into the left side of the box, carrying the Dynamo (2-1-1, seven points) to their second straight victory. Smith's shot was just the second on goal for Houston.

Dynamo goalkeeper Steve Clark was credited with two saves while recording his first shutout of the year and the 63rd of his 11-year MLS career. Clark and the Houston defense had to fend off the Rapids for five additional minutes after Smith's tally.

The Rapids (1-2-2, five points) outshot Houston 8-5 and also had just two shots on goal. Colorado is still winless in two home games this season.

The Dynamo got the game's first real scoring chance in the 22nd minute when Ibrahim Aliyu hit a right-footed shot from the center of the penalty area, but Steffen made the save.

The Rapids swung back with a Djordje Mihailovic shot on goal in the 42nd minute that forced Clark to make a stop.

After the teams exchanged yellow cards midway through the second half, Colorado's Kevin Cabral challenged Clark with a left-footed shot from the center of the box in the 66th minute, but Houston's last line of defense was up to the task.

The Mihailovic tried again to beat Clark in the 75th minute from near the same spot as Cabral, but could not get his shot past the Houston keeper.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

In the area, they found dinosaur fossils and prehistoric rock art.

A new study described Serrote do Letreiro Site, a rural property in the Sousa municipality of Paraíba state, northeastern Brazil. With three huge rock outcrops spanning over 160,000 square feet, the site is distinguished by an ""outstanding juxtaposition"" of archaeological and paleontological features.

These features include many petroglyphs, a form of rock engraving made by chiseling portions of the surface, and the footprints of numerous dinosaurs, dating back around 140 million years to the Lower Cretaceous period.

""The main discovery [of the study] is that the site brings together petroglyphs [rock art] and dinosaur fossils like no other archaeological or paleontological site in the world,"" said Leonardo Troiano, an archaeologist with Brazil's National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and lead author of the study. ""Although there are occurrences of fossils and rock art nearby, a site where they are literally side by side has never been described.""

Previous researchers did not consider the relationship between the rock arts and dinosaur footprints. Troiano and his colleagues surveyed the Serrote do Letreiro site and used drones to take aerial photos of the area to understand more about it.

The research found more dinosaur footprints and numerous petroglyphs, and there was a strong association between the two. Troiano said they were the first to notice the close connection between the footprints and the petroglyphs.

They concluded that, given its vulnerability and location in a mining-heavy area, it was necessary to disclose the site or risk its destruction.

The Sousa region's condition preserved the footprints but not the bones. As a result, while many fossilized footprints have been discovered in the area, comparatively few dinosaur bones have been preserved.

Because of this, it is challenging to identify the precise dinosaur species that left the imprints. According to the experts, however, they depict ornithopod, theropod, and sauropod dinosaurs.

Petroglyphs are art or paintings physically carved into the rock using a stone chisel and hammerstone. They were formed when the lighter rock underneath was revealed by the chipping off of the desert varnish, often known as patina.

According to archaeologists' estimates, over 25,000 petroglyph pictures may exist along the 17 miles of escarpment that form the monument's perimeter.

Ninety percent of the petroglyphs at the monument are thought to have been made by the Pueblo people's ancestors. Before 500 A.D., Puebloans resided in the Rio Grande Valley; nevertheless, a population boom around 1300 A.D. resulted in many new villages. Most petroglyphs are thought to have been carved between roughly 1300 and the late 1680s.

Petroglyphs are not merely picture writing, ""rock art,"" or replicas of the natural world. They are potent cultural icons that capture the intricate social structures and diverse religious practices of the neighboring tribes.",sciencetimes.com,news,Science Times,Caleb White,0.05098039215686279,448949817,1,https://1721181113.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/52728/820/0/0/0/new-archaeological-paleontological-site-with-dinosaur-footprint-petroglyphs-discovered-in-brazil.jpeg,

At yesterday's (March 21) meeting of Kirklees Council's District-Wide Planning Committee, members approved plans for nine homes to be brought to Forest Road, Almondbury. Part of the site is allocated as Urban Green Space in the council's Local Plan, but council officers considered the application to be an appropriate use of the land on a ""fine balance"", partially due to its condition.

The meeting was the committee's first since the council moved to a ""streamlined"" planning process which will see more decisions made by officers. Applications are now only determined by a committee if they are a big departure from the Local Plan, receive a large amount of public opposition, or when they are referred by a councillor.

In this case, ward councillor Bernard McGuin (Con) had referred the plans due to numerous concerns over drainage issues, access problems and the steepness of the land.

Speaking at the meeting, Cllr McGuin pleaded with the committee to turn down the application, describing it as a ""tragedy"" if the area were to lose Urban Green Space. He explained that the Almondbury Bank Preservation Group had carried out work to maintain neighbouring woodland, and that ""any further destruction would hinder their work"".

He said: ""Please, you've got a good reason to reject this application purely on the basis that it's Urban Green Space. I do take the planner's point that it might not be good value at the moment because it's not being managed well but it could be managed better and we've got a group that are willing to do the work on that area because they've proved it in the adjoining woods.""

Seven objections had previously been submitted by members of the public who voiced similar concerns. One resident said they were ""appalled by the stupidity of the plans"", while another living across from the site was especially concerned about a loss of privacy.

Cllr Alison Munro (Almondbury Lib, Dem) who was substituting on the committee, pushed for the refusal of the application on the basis of the loss of green space and the impact this would have on local people and wildlife. She also felt that the homes would ""overwhelm"" the space and detract from the landscape, therefore falling short of planning policy.

Some members of the panel felt differently, with Cllr Eric Firth (Labour, Dewsbury East) describing the area as an ""urban eyesore"" rather than Urban Green Space and said the land is ""screaming out"" for development. Cllr Mohan Sokhal (Labour, Greenhead) made a similar point and said the site looks ""derelict"".

Councillor Donna Bellamy (Con, Holme Valley North), acknowledged that the site needed a tidy-up but was concerned about the parking situation on the narrow road, with a ""fair few"" cars being parked when the committee visited the site earlier that day. She said: ""I can imagine that later on in the day when people aren't at work and everybody's got their cars there that it could be even more constrained on that road and that is my worry.""

An officer explained that there was no room to refuse the application over highway issues as there is ""sufficient"" off-street parking provided as part of the application.

But some plants that once thrived in your yard may not flourish there now. To understand why, look to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent update of its plant hardiness zone map, which has long helped gardeners and growers figure out which plants are most likely to thrive in a given location.

Comparing the 2023 map to the previous version from 2012 clearly shows that as climate change warms the Earth, plant hardiness zones are shifting northward. On average, the coldest days of winter in our current climate, based on temperature records from 1991 through 2020, are 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) warmer than they were between 1976 and 2005.

In some areas, including the central Appalachians, northern New England and north central Idaho, winter temperatures have warmed by 1.5 hardiness zones - 15 degrees F (8.3 C) - over the same 30-year window. This warming changes the zones in which plants, whether annual or perennial, will ultimately succeed in a climate on the move.

As a plant pathologist, I have devoted my career to understanding and addressing plant health issues. Many stresses not only shorten the lives of plants, but also affect their growth and productivity.

I am also a gardener who has seen firsthand how warming temperatures, pests and disease affect my annual harvest. By understanding climate change impacts on plant communities, you can help your garden reach its full potential in a warming world.

There's no question that the temperature trend is upward. From 2014 through 2023, the world experienced the 10 hottest summers ever recorded in 174 years of climate data. Just a few months of sweltering, unrelenting heat can significantly affect plant health, especially cool-season garden crops like broccoli, carrots, radishes and kale.

Winters are also warming, and this matters for plants. The USDA defines plant hardiness zones based on the coldest average annual temperature in winter at a given location. Each zone represents a 10-degree F range, with zones numbered from 1 (coldest) to 13 (warmest). Zones are divided into 5-degree F half zones, which are lettered ""a"" (northern) or ""b"" (southern).

For example, the coldest hardiness zone in the lower 48 states on the new map, 3a, covers small pockets in the northernmost parts of Minnesota and has winter extreme temperatures of -40 F to -35 F. The warmest zone, 11b, is in Key West, Florida, where the coldest annual lows range from 45 F to 50 F.

On the 2012 map, northern Minnesota had a much more extensive and continuous zone 3a. North Dakota also had areas designated in this same zone, but those regions now have shifted completely into Canada. Zone 10b once covered the southern tip of mainland Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but has now been pushed northward by a rapidly encroaching zone 11a.

Many people buy seeds or seedlings without thinking about hardiness zones, planting dates or disease risks. But when plants have to contend with temperature shifts, heat stress and disease, they will eventually struggle to survive in areas where they once thrived.

Successful gardening is still possible, though. Here are some things to consider before you plant: Hardiness zones matter far less for annual plants, which germinate, flower and die in a single growing season, than for perennial plants that last for several years. Annuals typically avoid the lethal winter temperatures that define plant hardiness zones.

In fact, most annual seed packs don't even list the plants' hardiness zones. Instead, they provide sowing date guidelines by geographic region. It's still important to follow those dates, which help ensure that frost-tender crops are not planted too early and that cool-season crops are not harvested too late in the year.

Many perennials can grow across wide temperature ranges. For example, hardy fig and hardy kiwifruit grow well in zones 4-8, an area that includes most of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states. Raspberries are hardy in zones 3-9, and blackberries are hardy in zones 5-9. This eliminates a lot of guesswork for most gardeners, since a majority of U.S. states are dominated by two or more of these zones.

Nevertheless, it's important to pay attention to plant tags to avoid selecting a variety or cultivar with a restricted hardiness zone over another with greater flexibility. Also, pay attention to instructions about proper sun exposure and planting dates after the last frost in your area.

Fruit trees have two parts, the rootstock and the scion wood, that are grafted together to form a single tree. Rootstocks, which consist mainly of a root system, determine the tree's size, timing of flowering and tolerance of soil-dwelling pests and pathogens. Scion wood, which supports the flowers and fruit, determines the fruit variety.

Most commercially available fruit trees can tolerate a wide range of hardiness zones. However, stone fruits like peaches, plums and cherries are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations within those zones - particularly abrupt swings in winter temperatures that create unpredictable freeze-thaw events.

These seesaw weather episodes affect all types of fruit trees, but stone fruits appear to be more susceptible, possibly because they flower earlier in spring, have fewer hardy rootstock options, or have bark characteristics that make them more vulnerable to winter injury.

Perennial plants' hardiness increases through the seasons in a process called hardening off, which conditions them for harsher temperatures, moisture loss in sun and wind, and full sun exposure. But a too-sudden autumn temperature drop can cause plants to die back in winter, an event known as winter kill. Similarly, a sudden spring temperature spike can lead to premature flowering and subsequent frost kill.

Plants aren't the only organisms constrained by temperature. With milder winters, southern insect pests and plant pathogens are expanding their ranges northward.

One example is Southern blight, a stem and root rot disease that affects 500 plant species and is caused by a fungus, Agroathelia rolfsii. It's often thought of as affecting hot Southern gardens, but has become more commonplace recently in the Northeast US on tomatoes, pumpkins and squash, and other crops, including apples in Pennsylvania.

Other plant pathogens may take advantage of milder winter temperatures, which leads to prolonged saturation of soils instead of freezing. Both plants and microbes are less active when soil is frozen, but in wet soil, microbes have an opportunity to colonize dormant perennial plant roots, leading to more disease.

It can be challenging to accept that climate change is stressing some of your garden favorites, but there are thousands of varieties of plants to suit both your interests and your hardiness zone. Growing plants is an opportunity to admire their flexibility and the features that enable many of them to thrive in a world of change.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

Hailing from a family deeply rooted in the tea business, the duo highlighted their expertise in curating quality tea products, leveraging their family's export business.

While the 'sharks' commended the product's taste, packaging, and branding, they raised concerns about its pricing. Amit Jain was quick to bow out, citing the product as overpriced and expressing doubts about its mass appeal. Vineeta Singh echoed similar sentiments, noting that the focus on cups could limit the brand's potential.

Peacock has seen the full effect of its daring $110 million (£87m) NFL Playoff gamble. NBC's choice to spend $110 million on exclusive rights for a post-season clash in 2023 has paid off, as most customers kept their subscriptions for the Peacock service.

In January, it was controversial when the broadcaster announced they would exclusively show the Wild Card playoff game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins on their streaming platform. But it seems viewers decided to pay up and register for a subscription to watch the match.

Around 23 million viewers watched the playoff spectacle, according to Nielsen - an amazing number considering Peacock reportedly has about 30 million subscribers. New numbers from BarrettSportsMedia.com suggest that Peacock gained three million new subscribers just for the game.

Their study found that these new subscribers signed up in the three days leading up to the Wild Card game. The move was popular and led to lots of sign-ups. Their research also found that about 71 percent of these customers kept their subscription seven weeks after the game.

In the end, viewers were treated to a memorable clash on the night at Arrowhead Stadium as the Chiefs triumphed 26- 7 in sub-zero temperatures. The evening also proved controversial as it emerged that some fans were left with frostbite after they braved the arctic conditions to cheer on their team.

It appears that the success of the game from a broadcasting point of view has inspired other streaming giants to sit up and take notice, however. In fact, following on from NBC's major outlay for the Wild Card clash, Amazon have forked out some $120 million for an exclusive post-season game for 2024.

Either way, it appears that the reaction to the experiment has left key figures convinced that this kind of set-up could become more commonplace moving forward. Waxing lyrical about the work done by Peacock on the game, Hans Schroeder, the executive VP and COO of NFL Media, admitted: ""We were thrilled.

""It's pretty remarkable that the first time we put a wild card game on Peacock it beats the same time slot, same broadcast partner the year before, he explained to the The Hollywood Reporter.

""That's awesome, and I mean its a testament to how fans are changing and watching. It's a testament to what Comcast did to really build awareness there.

Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won the game en route to the Super Bowl

""We still believe broadcast is the biggest and widest platform. And so these are perfect opportunities to still leverage that and have the widest reach that we can, but use that in a way to build some of the newer platforms, in this case Peacock,"" Schroeder says, adding that the league will look for similar opportunities in coming years.

Schroeder added: ""The good thing about the rapid sort of rate of change in the media landscape overall is it's creating more choice and more opportunities, and we're going to continue to be selective. We like to really make sure we've done our work upfront so that any new thing we're going to do ,we give ourselves the best possible chance of success.""

""And I think that's what we'll continue to do and push our partners to figure out where they see opportunities, and on this end continue to explore the ones that we see as well, in a way that hopefully is all additive.""",mirror.co.uk,news,Mirror,Tom Beattie,0.2078431372549019,448949475,1,https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article32425926.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gettyimages-1938959318.jpg,eng-9419105

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

""There's a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here, given concerns about the changing environment and how it's probably getting warmer and dryer,"" McKee said. ""Why is it that our extensive drought cycles haven't seemed to be affecting the moose population?""

Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to recover.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

These female chief judges in their states are breaking the barriers and reaching the pinnacle of their careers in Northern Nigeria.

There are currently seven states in Northern Nigeria whose judicial arm of government are managed by women of excellence and competence who rose through the ranks despite the perceived, or imaginary, obstacles that confronted them.

Interestingly, this is happening in a country where, until recently, almost every profession was a man's world, including law. Slowly and steadily, some Nigerian women of great repute started making their presence felt in every sector - business, legislature, sports, law, you name it!

These women established themselves against all odds and pre-conceived notions and made their indelible mark in the legal profession.

While this very spirit motivates more women to keep fighting, these formidable women have no doubt achieved something that was considered unattainable at one point of time, particularly in their region. Today, we celebrate not only the destination they have reached, but also the journey they undertook to reach their goals.

Today, we bring to you the success stories of the seven remarkable female judges in Zamfara, Kano, Niger, Nasarawa, Bauchi , Gombe and Adamawa states, whose presence caused the glass ceiling to develop cracks deep enough to shatter their male counterparts, courtesy of the undeniable strides they have recorded.

Their courage, grit and determination of these legal amazons has no doubt formed the foundation for subsequent generations of fearless women in the region who will continue to overcome legal and societal barriers, advancing to the highest levels of their professions.

These trailblazers, according to records, have accomplished astounding series of firsts, shattering countless glass ceilings in the legal field.

Justice Dije Abdu Aboki is the first woman to serve as a judge in Kano State since its creation in May 1967. Her emergence as the first woman to hold such a high position at that level against all odds earned her recognition as the jinx breaker of gender marginalisation in a ttraditionally conservative socio-religious society.

Prior to her appointment and swearing-in as chief judge by Kano State Governor Abba Yusuf on August 7, 2023, Chief Justice Dije Aboki acted as chief judge in March 2023.

Born July 10, 1964, Dije Aboki attended Tudun Wada Primary School, Kano State, between 1969 and 1973.

The 59-year-old proceeded to Government Girls' College, Minna, Niger, from 1973 to 1978 for her secondary education and later graduated from Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, in 1983 (LLB. Hons).

She did her National Youth Service at Bayero University, Kano (1984 - 1985) and was called to the Bar in 1984.

She began her distinguished career as state counsel in 1985 under the state Ministry of Justice. A year later, she was appointed a magistrate and rose to become a high court judge in 2006.

A disciplinarian to the core, this eminent jurist is the wife of Hon. Justice Abdu Aboki, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and a mother to five children, three of them lawyers.

The Kano Chief Judge is a member of several associations including Magistrates Association of Nigeria, Nigerian Bar Association, International Bar Association. She was chairperson of the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Kano Chapter,1990 -1992, among others.

This legal icon is today serving with distinction with many of her judgement often evincing encomiums for her undoubted mastery of the law. Known for her gentle yet firm control with counsel who have been privileged to appear before her, this very honest jurist does not suffer fools lightly. She is said to be serving creditably.

Known for her hunger for positive and commendable results, on assumption of office, she was said to have set up various committees, among which are: Performance and Evaluation Committee headed by a high court judge that assess magistrates' performances on quarterly basics; Training Committee, also headed by a high court judge; Judicial Public Complaint and Anti-corruption Committee, headed by a high court judge and the Khadi of Shari'a Court of Appeal.

Exhibiting the refined person that she is, Dije's developmental strides have impacted positively on the productivity and welfare of her subordinates. She has so far cleansed the state judicial of indiscipline, corruption, and flagrant abuse of office, to mention a few unprofessional habits.

Justice Aisha Bashir-Aliyu was sworn into office as the first substantive female chief judge of Nasarawa State on April 13, 2021, by Governor Abdullahi Sule, after her confirmation by the Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC) and screening by the State House of Assembly.

After serving in acting capacity for three months due to the retirement of her predecessor, Chief Justice Suleiman Umaru Dikko, her appointment signified another milestone in the history of Nasarawa State Judiciary.

Although she is the fifth person to occupy the exalted position 24 years after the state was created in 1996, history holds it that she broke the gender record to occupy that all-important seat.

Appointed based on her track record of professionalism and experience, Aisha, whose integrity has been tested and trusted, has not only improved the welfare for judicial staff but a good coordinator, planner, organiser and, above all, a caring mother.

Many, especially within the legal profession in the state, firmly believe that she has done creditably.

Barrister Innocent Kigbu, a private legal practitioner in Lafia , was once quoted as saying that the infrastructural and moral changes in the state jjudicial was birthed by the legal luminary.

Justice Hafsat Abdulrahaman was sworn in as the substantive chief judge of Adamawa State on April 26, 2023, by Governor Ahmadu Umar Fintiri.

Her confirmation followed the consideration of a letter forwarded to the state assembly by the Governor Fintiri in response to NJC's recommendations.

So far, her landmark achievements have further proven that her life is characterised by deep insight and discernment, bold visions and courage, brave, unparalleled focus and determination.

Since she took over the mantle of leadership at the Bauchi State judiciary seven years ago in 2016, Justice Rabi Talatu Umar has through her vision and mission transformed the sector to an enviable height. She has given so much credibility to the judiciary and is being celebrated for that giant stride.

Sworn in by the former governor of Bauchi State, Abdullahi Abubakar, as the state's first female chief judge, Justice Umar's her appointment in 2016 to occupy the once vacant seat, after her predecessor Justice Ibrahim Mohammed Zango's retirement, has sanitised the sector to complainants' admiration.

This trailblazer who has recorded successes in her tortuous but successful journey won the confidence of the incumbent governor of the state, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, who, based on her competence in legal adjudication, did not even make any attempt to replace her.

On her watch, the Bauchi State Judiciary has fared well. She constantly calls for the understanding and sacrifice of her workforce, justice seekers and, in fact, all stakeholders in the sector, hence her ability to overcome the challenges and setbacks she met on ground.

She strongly believes that legal practitioners owe the society a great duty of deciding cases without fear or favour. For her, jurists who are clean and sincere in their rulings have no cause to be afraid or feel intimidated in spite of frivolous complaints, petitions or vitriolic attacks.

Justice Halima Ibrahim Abdulmalik made steady and deserving movement to become the fourth female chief judge of Niger State.

She was first appointed acting chief judge on February 25, 2022 following the retirement of the then chief judge, Justice Aisha Lami Bawa Bwari.

Justice Halima was later confirmed by the state House of Assembly and became the ninth substantive chief judge of the state.

She was sworn in on August 22, 2022, by the then governor of the state, Abubakar Sani Bello.

Before her appointment as chief judge, she had created a very credible image as a judicial officer in the state; thus, everybody attested to her good image and expressed confidence in her expected sterling stewardship as chief judge of the state.

A go-getter, disciplinarian, no-nonsense character, firm and fervent workaholic, she has not left anyone in doubt as she has continued to build confidence and credibility for the state judiciary.

In fact, Justice Halima, the entire state of Niger State, her colleagues and others have continued to marvel at her leadership strides.

Records have it that just within two years of her assumption, she has wielded the big stick on erring judicial officers, while those who have done well are lauded to serve as incentive.",leadership.ng,news,Leadership,"Abu Nmodu, Khalid Idris Doya, Ahmed Tahir Ajobe, Abdulmumin Murtala",0.3098039215686275,448949362,1,https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-24-044435.png,

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

''Moose are newcomers to North America,'' said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

''Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ''And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.''

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

''Why a moose hunt at all?'' Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ''We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.''

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ''Bullwinkle'' made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

''I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

''It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,'' said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of 200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000, which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100 permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for 3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to 12,000.

No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s but its growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.

Nevada's research suggests its population could sustain more harvests than planned, McKee said, but ""conservative is the name of the game here.""

Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots, males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might improve herd dynamics, he said.

The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks, but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future endeavors.

Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.

Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he intends to apply for a chance he describes as ""slim and none"" to draw a moose tag.

""For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,"" he said.

(AP) -- In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever moose hunting season this fall.

Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100, justifies the handful of harvests planned.

Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect wildlife, and why these majestic -- some say goofy-looking -- mammals the size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer territory.

""Moose are newcomers to North America,"" said Cody McKee, a Nevada Department of Wildlife specialist.

The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.

""Their post-glacial range expansion isn't really complete,"" McKee said. ""And that's what we're currently seeing in Nevada right now, is those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.""

Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting tags, and it's already controversial.

""Why a moose hunt at all?"" Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a recent wildlife commission meeting. ""We want to see moose, view moose. Not kill moose.""

The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before the dim-witted cartoon character ""Bullwinkle"" made his television debut. Only a handful of sightings followed for decades, but started increasing about 10 years ago.

By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada's northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts believe there's enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could be reached in three years.

Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's Southwest program director, is among the skeptics who suspect it's a short-lived phenomenon.

""I believe the moose story is one of 'ghost' habitat or 'ghost' range expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,"" Bird said.

Government biologists admit they don't fully understand why the moose have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier than they traditionally prefer.

""It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose expansion given their ecology,"" said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&M University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth trends.

Six feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and up to 1,000 pounds (453.5 kilograms), moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the northern half of Nevada.

They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius).

The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in areas where that ""thermal threshold"" was exceeded about 150 days a year, while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.

To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain ranges with moose are 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip in the desert many people picture as Nevada.

Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a toll on other wildlife, McKee said.

The new rules relax initial tailpipe limits proposed last year but eventually get close to the same strict standards set out by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The rules come as sales of electric vehicles, which are needed to meet the standards, have begun to slow. The auto industry cited lower sales growth in objecting to the EPA's preferred standards unveiled last April as part of its ambitious plan to cut planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles.

The EPA said that under its final rule, the industry could meet the limits if 56% of new vehicle sales are electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, as well as more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.

That would be a huge increase over current EV sales, which rose to 7.6% of new vehicle sales last year, up from 5.8% in 2022.

The new standards will avoid more than 7 billion tons of planet-warming carbon emissions over the next three decades and provide nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits, the EPA said, including lower health care costs, fewer deaths and more than $60 billion in reduced annual costs for fuel, maintenance and repairs.

President Joe Biden, who has made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency, cited ""historic progress"" on his pledge that half of all new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. will be zero-emission by 2030.

""We'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead,'' Biden said in a statement Wednesday.

The EPA rule applies to model years 2027 to 2032 and will significantly reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as well as other air pollution such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks and pickups.

Transportation makes up the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and cars and trucks account for more than half of those emissions. The EPA said the new rule will help ""tackle the climate crisis"" while accelerating the adoption of cleaner vehicle technologies. The agency is finalizing the rule as sales of clean vehicles, including plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, hit record highs last year.

The new rule slows implementation of stricter pollution standards from 2027 through 2029, after the auto industry called proposed benchmarks unworkable. The rule ramps up to nearly reach the level the EPA preferred by 2032.

""Let me be clear: Our final rule delivers the same, if not more, pollution reduction than we set out in our proposal,'' EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters. In addition to carbon pollution, the final standards also will reduce other serious air pollution that contributes to heart attacks, respiratory illnesses, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function, Regan said.

""Folks, these new standards are so important for public health, for American jobs, for our economy and for our planet,'' he said.

The standards are designed to be technology-neutral and performance-based, Regan said, giving car and truck manufacturers the flexibility to choose pollution-control technologies that are best suited for their customers while meeting environmental and public health goals.

The changes appear aimed at addressing strong industry and labor opposition to the accelerated ramp-up of EVs, along with public reluctance to fully embrace the new technology. There is also a legitimate threat of legal challenges before conservative courts.

The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted the EPA's authority to fight air and water pollution -- including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.

At the same time, the Democratic president needs cooperation from the auto industry and political support from auto workers, a key political voting bloc.

""U.S. workers will lead the world on autos -- making clean cars and trucks, each stamped 'Made in America,'"" Biden said Wednesday. ""You have my word.''

The United Auto Workers union, which has endorsed Biden, said it supports rules that benefit workers and the environment, not just the industry. The new rule protects workers who build combustion engine vehicles ""while providing a path forward for automakers to implement the full range of automotive technologies to reduce emissions,"" the union said.

Generally, environmental groups have been optimistic about the new EPA plan, which is aimed at slashing emissions from a source that causes one-fifth of the nation's carbon pollution.

David Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the rule would significantly reduce vehicle pollution from current requirements. But the standards are weaker than those EPA proposed a year ago and make it unlikely that the U.S. will be able to meet its commitments under the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, which aims to keep global warming from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, he said.

Still, the new rules over time will prevent more carbon pollution ""than the entire U.S. economy coughs up in a year,'' said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. In the short term, the rules ""will save drivers money at the pump and cut tailpipe pollution that endangers public health,'' he added.

""In the longer journey to confront the climate crisis, these standards take us in the right direction,'' he said.

But Dan Becker at the Center for Biological Diversity said he fears loopholes will let the industry continue to sell gas burners. He also is afraid the industry will get away with doing little during the first three years of the standards, which could be undone if former President Donald Trump is reelected.

""The bottom line is that the administration is caving to pressure from big oil, big auto and the dealers to stall progress on EVs and now allow more pollution from cars,"" Becker said.

Republicans criticized the new standards, saying they essentially decide for the public which vehicles they should buy. ""These regulations represent yet another step toward an unrealistic transition to electric vehicles that Americans do not want and cannot afford,"" said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, called the rule a ""misguided electric vehicle mandate"" that will force the U.S. to rely on China and other foes for critical minerals needed for batteries.

Regan said the government isn't requiring people to buy EVs or any other technology, adding that there are ""multiple pathways companies can choose to comply'' with the rule.

""We are staying well within the confines of the law and our statutory authority by not mandating a specific technology,'' he said.

The EPA could achieve its carbon pollution goals even if sales of battery electric vehicles are as low as 30% in 2032, as long as other standards are met, he said.

U.S. electric vehicle sales grew 47% last year to a record 1.19 million as EV market share rose to 7.6%. But EV sales growth slowed toward the end of the year. In December, they rose 34%.

The Alliance for Auto Innovation, a large industry trade group, praised the EPA's slower implementation of the standards, saying the pace of the EV transition matters as the industry moves to produce more electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids to convert more traveling miles to electricity. The group had complained that the ramp-up to 67% initially proposed by the EPA was too fast for the industry to achieve. The proposal was faster than Biden's goal of ensuring that EVs account for half of new vehicles in the U.S. by 2030.

""Moderating the pace of EV adoption was the right call because it prioritizes more reasonable electrification targets in the next few, very critical years of the transition,"" said John Bozzella, the Alliance CEO.

The adjusted emissions targets will still be a stretch for the industry to achieve, Bozzella said, but they should give the market and parts supply chains a chance to catch up to higher EV sales. The plan also gives the industry more time to set up public charging stations, and it allows government tax incentives for EV manufacturing and for consumers to buy EVs to take hold, he said.

Toyota, the top seller of hybrid vehicles in the U.S., said it believes the fastest way to reduce carbon emissions quickly is to give consumers choices of battery electric vehicles and hybrids. The new EPA standards allow for more sales of plug-in hybrids and regular gas-electric hybrids to meet emissions limits.

West has used Ye as a nickname for years, referring to Kanye as his 'slave name' and claiming inaccurately that Ye is the most frequently used word in the Bible.

In October 2021, months after his ex-wife Kim Kardashian filed for divorce, he took the step of having his name legally changed to Ye.

Now, his chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos has sent around a letter to industry honchos insisting that the switch be respected, TMZ reports.

'Ye is a black man in America who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else,' wrote Yiannopoulos, an 'ex-gay' media personality who shot to fame as a right-wing pundit before his association with the rap star.

'Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, on par with presidents and popes. He didn't take the decision to change his name, potentially sacrificing some of the immense value captured by the brand ""Kanye West,"" lightly,' the letter began.

'The change was made fully, legally, and permanently. This is who he is now. His name is Ye,' Yiannopoulos continued.

'We are reaching out to streaming platforms, publishers, stores, unions, lyrics websites and data resellers. This change will happen everywhere,' he added.

'Your platform has been identified as one of the most visible places this change may occur, and we passionately hope you will be able to fully and properly reflect the new name and identity of such an enormously influential and historic figure.'

In reference to West's original name Kanye, Yiannopoulos wrote: 'He has on several occasions referred to it as his slave name. Ye is a black man in American who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else.

'My colleagues and I are reaching out at his urging and hope you can assist in this effort by bringing any and all instances of his name into line on your services.'

The letter comes after it emerged Kanye is being summoned to spend time with his wife Bianca Censori's father in Australia, according to sources, who claim the architect is 'hesitant' to face her dad's wrath over her near-naked outfits and controversial relationship with the rapper.

DailyMail.com previously reported that Bianca's father Leo was keen to confront his son-in-law - who married the Aussie designer in December 2022 - just one month after finalizing his divorce from ex-wife Kim Kardashian.",newzimbabwe.com,news,NewZimbabwe.com,,0.2078431372549019,448948938,1,,eng-9420409

The event to kickstart the same, at NABARD Mumbai, was inaugurated by Shri Shaji K.V., Chairman, NABARD who, in his keynote address, emphasised the criticality of water availability for the marginalised segments and the need to focus on impact rather than returns to support them. To quote him, ""Water is a public good but the water balance is changing due to climate change. It is the most marginalised who face the brunt of climate risk and their livelihoods are getting affected. NABARD being a public finance institution is looking at innovative solutions to support the most needy segment by partnering with Panchayart Raj Institutions, Civil Society organisations, Government agencies to create a larger impact. Awareness generation is key to such solutions. Our subsidiary NABSAMRUDDHI has piloted the Climate Ready WASH funding programme under which the campaign for creating awareness among end borrowers has been kick-started today, with support from NABARD. The mainstreaming of the initiative will help to address these challenges as well"".

NABSAMRUDDHI has been providing concessional wholesale WASH loans by availing refinance from NABARD, blended technical support from its partners Water.org, FINISH Mondial, to foster sustainable livelihoods. So far, 45 Million USD of WASH funding has been provided by the NBFC through 32 partner institutions, covering 75,000 end borrowers, 90% of whom are women.

The campaign will cover 40 block level camps in climate vulnerable areas in 7 states in phase 1 through FINISH Mondial. To support the same, 3 exposure visits had been conducted for stakeholders since NABSAMRUDDHI pioneered the programme in November 2023, while 8 term loans have been sanctioned.

In a recent investigation into AI's role in regional development, CNA unveils groundbreaking projects leveraging machine learning to address age-old environmental issues. From revolutionizing weather forecasting to monitoring biodiversity and quantifying plastic pollution, these initiatives are poised to reshape sustainability efforts in the region.

In the dynamic realm of weather forecasting, precision and timeliness are paramount, especially in regions susceptible to climate extremes like the Philippines. Atmo AI, spearheaded by co-founder Mr Alex Levy, is on the cusp of transforming weather prediction by harnessing AI's capabilities. Through a partnership with PAGASA, the national meteorological agency, Atmo AI aims to provide more accurate and localized forecasts, crucial for a nation enduring a quarter of the world's typhoons annually. By shunning conventional methods and embracing machine learning, this collaboration promises to empower communities with enhanced preparedness and resilience against climate-related disasters.

With traditional forecasting methods failing to keep pace with evolving weather patterns, Atmo AI's disruptive approach heralds a new era in meteorological science. By dissecting vast urban landscapes into thousands of distinct zones, the platform offers unprecedented granularity, akin to donning glasses for a clearer vision. Ms Maria Cristina Uson of PAGASA emphasizes the potential of AI-driven forecasts in bolstering early warning systems, a vital component in safeguarding lives and mitigating property damage. As the Philippines embarks on this pioneering journey, neighboring nations express keen interest, hinting at a broader regional adoption of AI-based weather forecasting.

Venturing into the heart of Southeast Asia's lush rainforests, AI's transformative potential extends to biodiversity monitoring, a critical endeavor in conservation efforts. Clara Hernblom and Johan Närvä, students from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, embark on a quest to decode the region's diverse ecosystems, from pristine forests to degraded landscapes. Armed with AI-powered audio recorders and the Arbimon platform, the duo endeavors to decipher wildlife activity and assess restoration efforts in Sabah, Malaysia's Borneo island. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize data collection, enabling real-time analysis and insights crucial for informed conservation decisions.

Arbimon's evolution from a rudimentary audio storage tool to a sophisticated AI platform underscores its pivotal role in bridging the gap between science and conservation. Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection, underscores the platform's global impact, with millions of recordings analyzed across diverse ecosystems worldwide. Despite AI's immense potential in eco-acoustics, regulatory hurdles impede its widespread adoption in Southeast Asia. Mr Yassin advocates for decentralized data governance, essential for fostering international collaboration and maximizing AI's conservation benefits. As the region grapples with biodiversity loss, AI-driven solutions offer a ray of hope in safeguarding Southeast Asia's natural heritage.

In a bid to combat pressing environmental challenges, Southeast Asia is witnessing the emergence of environmental AI solutions, showcasing the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a recent investigation into AI's role in regional development, CNA unveils groundbreaking projects leveraging machine learning to address age-old environmental issues. From revolutionizing weather forecasting to monitoring biodiversity and quantifying plastic pollution, these initiatives are poised to reshape sustainability efforts in the region.

Revolutionizing weather forecasting with AI

In the dynamic realm of weather forecasting, precision and timeliness are paramount, especially in regions susceptible to climate extremes like the Philippines. Atmo AI, spearheaded by co-founder Mr Alex Levy, is on the cusp of transforming weather prediction by harnessing AI's capabilities. Through a partnership with PAGASA, the national meteorological agency, Atmo AI aims to provide more accurate and localized forecasts, crucial for a nation enduring a quarter of the world's typhoons annually. By shunning conventional methods and embracing machine learning, this collaboration promises to empower communities with enhanced preparedness and resilience against climate-related disasters.

With traditional forecasting methods failing to keep pace with evolving weather patterns, Atmo AI's disruptive approach heralds a new era in meteorological science. By dissecting vast urban landscapes into thousands of distinct zones, the platform offers unprecedented granularity, akin to donning glasses for a clearer vision. Ms Maria Cristina Uson of PAGASA emphasizes the potential of AI-driven forecasts in bolstering early warning systems, a vital component in safeguarding lives and mitigating property damage. As the Philippines embarks on this pioneering journey, neighboring nations express keen interest, hinting at a broader regional adoption of AI-based weather forecasting.

Environmental AI solutions - Amplifying conservation efforts

Venturing into the heart of Southeast Asia's lush rainforests, AI's transformative potential extends to biodiversity monitoring, a critical endeavor in conservation efforts. Clara Hernblom and Johan Närvä, students from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, embark on a quest to decode the region's diverse ecosystems, from pristine forests to degraded landscapes. Armed with AI-powered audio recorders and the Arbimon platform, the duo endeavors to decipher wildlife activity and assess restoration efforts in Sabah, Malaysia's Borneo island. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize data collection, enabling real-time analysis and insights crucial for informed conservation decisions.

Arbimon's evolution from a rudimentary audio storage tool to a sophisticated AI platform underscores its pivotal role in bridging the gap between science and conservation. Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection, underscores the platform's global impact, with millions of recordings analyzed across diverse ecosystems worldwide. Despite AI's immense potential in eco-acoustics, regulatory hurdles impede its widespread adoption in Southeast Asia. Mr Yassin advocates for decentralized data governance, essential for fostering international collaboration and maximizing AI's conservation benefits. As the region grapples with biodiversity loss, AI-driven solutions offer a ray of hope in safeguarding Southeast Asia's natural heritage.

Climate change, shown in the increases of temperature, rainfall, humidity, sea level and extreme weather intensity, has been identified by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as a threat to culture and heritage sites.

In Việt Nam the issue of preserving and protecting world and national heritage from climate change has been raised by experts for a long time, but over time many natural wonders are at risk of disappearing.

Most recently, lightning hit the attractive scenery of Hòn Vọng Phu (the Rock of Vọng Phu, a 20m high rock resembling the shape of a standing woman, waiting for her soldier husband, according to legend) in the central province of Thanh Hóa.

Rock Vọng Phu located on An Hoạch Mountain in Thanh Hóa City was recognised by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism as a national heritage site in 1992.

The incident occurred several times in June and August 2022, causing a landslide in the area around and serious damage to different parts of the rock.

The damage had put the rock in a very dangerous situation, and it could collapse at any time if no effective measures are taken to protect and preserve it soon, Trần Đình Thành, deputy director of the Department of Cultural Heritage of Thanh Hóa City, said.

Recently, the People's Committee [Government] of Thanh Hóa issued an official dispatch regarding a project protecting the heritage site from the impacts of natural disasters.

Meanwhile, sea erosion has also constantly affected Hòn Trống Mái (Kissing Rocks), the iconic twin rocks, emblematic of the UNESCO world natural heritage of Hạ Long Bay in the northern coastal province of Quảng Ninh.

The rocks face threats due to geological processes and rising seawater levels, as highlighted by a study from the Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources.

Standing roughly 14m tall, the base of Hòn Trống Mái is more slender than its upper structure. Due to geological and tectonic movements, along with the influence of seawater levels, the rocks present a single-tilted structure with multiple fractures.

""There are many factors affecting Hòn Trống Mái such as waves, wind, water, tides, currents, and people,"" said Hồ Tiến Chung, head of the Tectonic and Geomorphology Department of the institute.

In 2016, the 'head' of the renowned Thiên Nga (Swan) islet in Hạ Long Bay detached and plummeted into the sea.

To counteract the corrosion at the base of the rocks, the institute's experts have suggested implementing technical solutions. Moreover, they recommended that the Hạ Long Bay management board should introduce measures to regulate the movement of tourist craft. This would involve controlling the speed of ships and boats near the rocks and educating local fishermen to refrain from operating around the rocks.

At present, Việt Nam has nine UNESCO heritage sites: Hạ Long Bay in Quảng Ninh, Hạ Long Bay-Cát Bà Archipelago in Quảng Ninh Province-Hải Phòng City, Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park in the central province of Quảng Bình, Huế Monuments Complex in the ancient city of Huế, Hội An Ancient Town and Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary in the south central province of Quảng Nam, the Central Sector of the Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long - Hà Nội, the Citadel of Hồ Dynasty in Thanh Hóa, and Tràng An Landscape Complex in Ninh Bình Province.

Studies by the Institute of Meteorology, Geology and Physics of Innsbruck University, Austria, 10 years ago pointed out that seven of the sites had suffered from climate change, especially the Huế Monuments.

Storms and floods left rotten wood, damaged tiles and degraded the site. The Huế Monuments Conservation Centre has continuously tried to reinforce the foundation and embankment at damaged areas.

The heritage of Hội An Ancient Town has a similar fate. As a major part of the town's architecture includes many ancient wooden houses, which are regularly subject to flooding, the situation is worsening as storm surges increase.

High sea levels cause flooding, hinder drainage, increase underground water levels, and negatively affect the stability of building foundations.

Changes in water level and salinity also lead to changes in wet-dry cycles, salt crystallisation, and dissolution, contributing to accelerating the process of degradation of the foundations of ancient structures.

Speaking at a workshop held to assess the situation at Rock Vọng Phu, Director of the Institute of Mineral Geology Trần Tân Văn, an expert with many years of experience in consulting the World Heritage and UNESCO Global Geopark, said that though such heritage sites were natural phenomena, human impact contributed to affecting them in many negative ways.

The expert took the Kissing Rocks as a typical example, saying that the problem of tourist exploitation and allowing ships to visit them at close quarters with high frequency had created stronger water waves and added erosion.

The process of corrosion and collapse is an incredibly long process, according to Văn, but in today's times, climate change is becoming increasingly evident due to specific manifestations such as natural disasters, which are increasingly strong in intensity and erratic in frequency.

""These factors aggravate and accelerate the collapse of natural heritage sites,"" Văn said

The state is heightening clean energy standards every five or 10 years, and the next benchmark is 2025.

And a recent New Mexico Supreme Court ruling limits how the utilities can collect money -- including surcharges on consumers' bills -- to pay for increasingly more renewable energy resources over the next couple of decades, something that's not a cheap ask.

So how can the electricity companies afford to pay for new renewable energy facilities or acquire the clean energy otherwise? A University of New Mexico finance professor thinks the solution will likely be price increases and mergers.

40% renewables by 2025

By 2025, public utilities' electricity retail sales by law have to be made up of at least 40% renewable energy. It's an increase from the 20% renewable standard that was required starting in 2020.

And gradually, over the next two decades, utilities will have to eventually be emissions-free. By 2030, the renewable standard increases to 50%. Then, it's a big jump to 80% renewables by 2040 and, finally, a 100% carbon-free standard by 2045.

To ensure utilities are meeting the goals, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approves renewable energy plans for New Mexico's three investor-owned utilities -- Public Service Company of New Mexico, El Paso Electric and Southwestern Public Service Co., which is a subsidiary of Xcel Energy.

With ongoing clean energy plans for all the utilities with commission approval, the companies appear on track to meet the upcoming 2025 benchmark.

PNM expects to exceed PRC-approved renewable portfolio standards in 2024 and 2025, utility spokesperson Ray Sandoval said. PNM didn't ask for any new resource generation additions for either year the commission hasn't already approved, he said.

He said PNM's energy portfolio in 2025 is expected to consist of 68% solar energy, 29% wind energy, 1% geothermal energy and 1% distributed generation. Distributed generation refers to different technologies that generate electricity, such as solar panels, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

PNM has committed to be fully emissions-free by 2040, five years ahead of the state deadline.

""PNM is well ahead on achieving the higher (renewable portfolio standard) standard for 2025 as we continue to pursue a carbon-free grid by 2040,"" Sandoval said.

SPS spokesperson Wes Reeves said EPE expects to meet the 2025 deadline as well. He said in 2025, the utility anticipates having about 94% wind energy and 7% solar energy in renewable energy certificates, a way to measure utilities' renewable energy resources.

EPE didn't respond to inquiries regarding its energy portfolio and progress on the clean energy transition from the Journal.

The court ruling

A New Mexico Supreme Court opinion from this week affects how investor-owned utilities can collect money to comply with the state energy transition rules.

To prove they're meeting renewable energy standards, public utilities have to annually retire a certain amount of ""renewable energy certificates"" relative to electricity sold, as a form of proof that the companies are generating electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar.

If the utilities don't need to use the certificates the same year, the companies can bank them for up to four years and retire them later to meet renewable energy requirements then.

That's basically what SPS wanted the PRC to approve in 2021 when the utility voiced its intent to meet the 40%-renewables-by-2025 benchmark early through banked certificates. But the utility also wanted commissioners to allow the company to charge customers more as a financial incentive to meet the clean energy goals early.

The PRC can approve incentives if the investor-owned utilities meet the clean energy standards early. SPS ultimately wanted to collect $5.23 million over a three-year period from New Mexicans as an incentive.

State regulators denied SPS' request to add the surcharge to customers' bills.

SPS appealed the decision with the New Mexico Supreme Court, and on Monday, the court upheld state regulators' ruling.

""(A)t this stage, SPS seeks a reward -- not an incentive -- for renewable resources or energy that it already has produced or acquired beyond the (Renewable Energy Act's) demands,"" the court opinion states.

The PRC also originally rejected the SPS incentive proposal because the utility didn't put forth any firm plans on how it would exceed the 2025 standard and therefore justify getting a financial incentive. The Supreme Court agreed with the PRC on that as well.

Judges wrote that there's nothing in the law that suggests lawmakers intended utilities to be awarded under these circumstances.

""SPS's proposal thus would have done nothing to expand SPS's renewable energy portfolio or reduce carbon emissions during the three years that its requested incentive would have been in effect,"" the court wrote.

Reilly White is an associate professor at the University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management. He said the ruling sets a precedent that the investor-owned utilities can't charge New Mexicans more money for hitting the state's renewable energy standards early.

""It says you can hit the goal but you can't raise extra money through a rate rider this way,"" he said.

He said renewable energy certificates don't require the production or acquisition of more renewable resources. So, he said, utilities can't achieve the goals, meet incentives and then get compensated for it.

""If the ruling had gone the other way, I would expect to see all of our investor-owned utilities to be engaged in a very aggressive use of these banked credits as a way to fulfill these guidelines,"" he said. ""So it basically shuts the door on doing that sort of thing as a strategy for gaining incentives.""

A costly transition

Meanwhile, utilities still need to invest a lot of money to meet renewable energy goals, White said.

""They have to retire plants that aren't producing clean energy. They have to build plants that produce clean energy or acquire that electricity from somewhere else,"" he said. ""All of that costs money.""

He said raising money is more expensive right now, too, because interest rates are higher.

""It is a very, very challenging scenario for utility companies to achieve these targets,"" he said.

The investor-owned utilities will likely push harder for price increases in the next decade or more, White said.

He said it's also likely utility merger proposals will become more common, a way to allow multiple companies to gather resources and capital to meet New Mexico's renewable energy standards.

State regulators have to approve any plans for billing increases and mergers. In 2021, they denied a request from PNM to combine with Avangrid, a subsidiary of the energy giant Iberdrola, citing risks for customers. The utilities appealed the decision with the New Mexico Supreme Court, but Avangrid pulled out of the merger before judges ruled on the matter.

PNM Resources Chair and CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said at the time, PNM had been looking forward to the experience Avangrid has in a clean energy transition.

White said if a utility can merge with a company that has clean energy expertise, it's a method to get the capital and resources needed to meet the state's renewable energy goals.

""Twenty years is not a lot of time when it comes to fulfilling renewable energy goals that involve a substantial investment,"" he said.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2862745098039217,448947404,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9415511

While global negotiations on climate change often take place at the country level, cities such as Hong Kong have an important part to play. The recent commentary by Joy Belmonte, mayor of Quezon City in the Philippines, and Michal Mlynar, UN assistant secretary general and acting executive director of UN-Habitat, on the Economist Impact’s blog highlights the critical role of cities in combating the climate crisis. As the authors rightfully point out, cities are not only vulnerable to the impacts of climate change but also hold the key to solving it.

With over half of the world’s population living in cities and this share projected to increase to nearly 70 per cent by 2050, it is imperative that national governments recognise cities as crucial partners in achieving global climate goals. The new Coalition for High Ambition Multi-Level Partnerships initiative, launched at Cop28, aims to ensure that national governments work closely with local governments – be they cities, states or regions – on climate plans to make nationally determined contributions (NDCs) bolder ahead of Cop30 in 2025. This is a step in the right direction as cities have already demonstrated their potential in implementing climate solutions and setting ambitious targets.

At past climate summits, cities have collectively showcased their achievements in reducing emissions and building resilience. Through networks such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives and the Global Covenant of Mayors, cities have set their own ambitious climate targets and successfully implemented localised solutions, such as decarbonising public transport and buildings and reducing waste. These efforts have had a significant impact on the implementation of NDCs, complementing national governments’ commitments.

However, two-thirds of countries have moderate to low, or even no, urban content in their NDCs. Strengthening urban content in these countries’ NDCs offers an opportunity to accelerate global climate action and set more ambitious goals, enabling cities to access additional finance for mitigation and adaptation projects. With countries required to submit their updated NDCs before 2025, it is important that national governments and subnational actors like mayors and governors work together to raise national climate-action targets.

By working hand in hand with cities to make climate plans more ambitious, all levels of government can contribute to a more sustainable and climate-resilient future for all.

Kevin Li, researcher, CarbonCare InnoLabOfficials should lead by example on plastic

The front-page photograph in the Sunday Morning Post of March 10 of Department of Justice officials coming prepared for lunch during Article 23 deliberations was quite shocking.

As Hong Kong is about to implement a long-overdue ban on certain single-use plastics, and with a waste-charging scheme expected to commence in August after another delay, government officials being photographed carrying single-use plastic bags and plastic food containers sends the wrong message to the wider population.

If government officials lack sensitivity to Hong Kong being far behind several other developed cities in tackling the plastic plague, how can the government expect the rest of us to act and consume responsibly? The message seems to be, “Do as I say, not as I do.” All public officials should be leading by example.

However, perhaps even more disturbing is the report, “80% of Hong Kong’s small and medium-sized restaurants not ready for disposable plastics ban in April, lawmakers told” (March 13). Comments that the government has not done enough to educate businesses and the public on the ban are unwarranted given that plastic waste is not a sudden and new issue.

I do hope that the Department of Justice officials reused all those plastic containers and bags.

Simon Constantinides, Sai KungInvasive-species tracking a positive use of social media

The report “Chinese scientists use Douyin to monitor invasive species” (March 17) highlights the potential of social media and artificial intelligence in addressing ecological threats.

Invasive species pose a significant risk to ecosystems, disrupting local habitats and biodiversity. The practice of releasing non-native animals into the wild to garner good fortune has inadvertently contributed to the proliferation of these species.

By analysing text, images and videos on Douyin, ecologists can identify the location and frequency of releases of species such as the American bullfrog and the red-eared slider turtle, which are commonly found in the pet trade.

Not only does this approach aid conservation efforts, the use of social media platforms provides an opportunity for public education and awareness. By disseminating knowledge about the ecological damage caused by invasive species, we can promote compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.

This innovative approach expands the tools available to ecologists and underlines the usefulness of interdisciplinary efforts in protecting our environment. I hope this approach receives the support and recognition it deserves, leading to further advancements in conservation practices.

This was after the young man had helped many others secure lucrative contracts in the United Kingdom while fate refused to smile on him to clinch a similar deal and escape the economic hardships of home.

Moyo told Southern Eye On Sunday that he literally lost everything at that time, including his truck and several cars and headed to a cemetery in his home town, a bottle of whisky in hand, with the intention of ending his own life.

""I slept with the bottle of whisky on top of one of the graves and dreamt of white people coming to bury their loved ones,"" he recalled.

""When I woke up, I cleaned the grave where I had been sleeping. The daughter of the person in the grave arrived and said she had last visited the grave 16 years earlier.""

That is how Moyo's passion to clean and restore graves battered by the march of time began, and he has since made that his life's commitment.

""Much of the work is done for free, especially in the Rhodesian military graves and early settler graves,"" he said.

""I do however have private consultations where a family can approach me and ask me to maintain their graves. It helps me to feed my passion.""

Zimbabwe has several colonial gravesites scattered across the country including the Masvingo (former Fort Victoria) cemetery, Zvishavane Cemetery and Pioneer Cemetery in Harare. Some of the graves in Pioneer Cemetery have fallen apart due to the passage of time, with the earliest burials having been conducted in the early 1900s.

Moyo said he would be interested in helping in the maintenance of entire cemeteries and even turn them into memorial parks and natural habitats for plants and small animals.

""There a lot of places with rich history that are just lying idle, which can be turned into theme parks,"" he said.

""I have been planting succulents and trimming down grass making sure the place is habitable for nature.""

Moyo said the maintenance of cemeteries was not only important in the preservation of history, but helped create earth-friendly ecosystems that benefited the environment.

""I have seen a lot of flora and small animals in these spaces and if properly managed these can be safe green spaces for humans and nature,"" he said.

Moyo said his work was mainly self-funded, driven by the desire to restore entire cemeteries, and with enough support, he could do more.

Although he said his wife and a handful of friends had thrown their weight behind him, he had also lost some acquaintances who found his ""obsession"" with graves quite creepy.

""I have lost some acquaintances because of the fear of graves and some people, with the African mentality of kuromba has been labelled on me by some,"" he recalled.

But Moyo said death did not have to be a sombre topic and he loved discussing about eath.

""I have managed to demystify the topic of death and helped families rekindle memories of their departed. I have listened to people pouring out their innermost emotions about a departed brother, father, sister, soldier friend or cousin. This work is always an emotional journey and includes sadness and tears,"" he said.

""After all is said and done, it's the sense of purpose that we get as a team when a family comes back to say thank you. Nothing beats that.""

African tradition has always frowned upon tampering with graves -- especially those in which the remains of strangers are interred -- but Moyo said what mattered were ""genuine intentions"" in tending to graves.

""I believe in the law of reciprocity; the graves and nature respects what respects it. We are taught to honour as we grow up and this applies to those you are related to and those you are not, so as a grave cleaner I have no problems with having known or not known the person in the grave,"" he said, adding that their work was done in accordance with the Cemeteries Act (Chapter 5:04).

""It is important to be conscious of the legal implications aligned to whatever one pursues.""

While some religions were more concerned with the eternal fate of a deceased person's spirit rather than their mortal remains, Moyo said the focus of his occupation was ""on grave and legacy of that person, not the body"".

""For me a grave is a special space especially when you have a given group of individuals who can relate or connect with that grave, which takes us back to the element of honour. The Bible commands us to honour. There is a blessing that comes with that command. This is why we have dead people's faces on money, memorials and monuments,"" he said.

Moyo has worked with people belonging to various religions and races and while there were differences in how they handled the dead, what united all of them was the honour accorded to their departed.

The restoration of graves, Moyo said, went beyond giving the burial spaces a facelift, in some cases with a dash of paint to make the tombstones almost new again, but was part of honouring notable individuals.

""The funding of any project that seeks to celebrate and honor the departed of any given society are quite commendable in my sight,"" he said.

Moyo has become a historian of sorts as, in many cases, whenever he posts pictures and videos of his work on his Facebook timeline, they are often accompanied by well-researched information about the individual in the grave.

This is particularly fascinating about those that fought in World War II, and those who contributed significantly to the building of Rhodesia.

Moyo attributes that aspect of his work to his mother.

""I was raised by a librarian so the culture of reading and researching has always been at the fingertips,"" he said.

I would define myself as an avid researcher who has been given praise by historians and those in genealogy. My mother is a librarian so I grew up in an environment of books.""

Moyo said he believed in retelling and preserving history as it was important for people to preserve their past.

""Our efforts seek to demystify social constructs that make us forget the human behind that farmer, soldier, or housewife. Death is a human ritual that no one will avoid. It just differs in the manner in which it arrives at your doorstep,"" he said.

Paying attention to detail in this line of work is critical, according to Moyo, and that included the types of stones used on various headstones.

""It's important to remember that headstones are lasting symbols that are erected by families after having put serious thoughts and resources to it. Therefore paying attention helps in the process of not only cleaning but preserving the headstone,"" he said.

Moyo said he worked with the History Society of Zimbabwe, as well as the Jewish and Muslim communities whenever they wanted their graves cleaned or fixed. The Jews and Muslims have dedicated sections within different cemeteries.

Tending to colonial graves has seen Moyo strike relationships with the surviving spouses of those whose graves he has worked on.

""I have had the privilege of befriending some of these Rhodesian women, and there are a handful of life lessons that I have learnt from them. Rhodesian women loved and knew their gardening, they also supported their men to the end. It's the wife who can either stir the greatness in a man or crush him to the last smallest bit. I do hope that the younger generation are taking down notes, most of these mentors are fast crossing the rainbow bridge.""

Beyond the pictures of the gravesites Moyo has worked on and the narratives about the occupants of the graves, his Facebook page is also a reservoir of significant historical information, including how funerals were conducted in Rhodesian from the 1890s to the 1970s

Moyo said they had also been planting native succulent species, many of which are in high demand for ornamental use by collectors, in the Masvingo cemetery.

""Hardy succulents are suited to graves that have borders and bare earth in the middle, within these borders we are planting succulents to give the graves a brighter look,"" he said.

""Most, if not all, of the wisdom I have about plants has been from the Rhodesian ladies. Many of them are amazing gardeners. Some research has asserted that succulents are known to bring in the energy of abundance and prosperity as they thrive in extremities of arid climates, retaining their life and watery sap.""

With the dream of relocating to Europe having been buried in his new passion, Moyo said he was calling on potential stakeholders to join hands with him, including civic organisations with a passion for history, the environment and the creation of green spaces and conservation to work with him.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Phillip Chidavaenzi,0.09019607843137245,448947383,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/southerneye/uploads/2024/03/QZfwx7XOdUJHd2tw44aaOCwozQF6ZNPtVJk3mT9M.jpg,

Jabari Smith Jr. and Kris Dunn were ejected five seconds into the second quarter after both were assessed technical fouls for fighting. The two threw punches at each other after they got tangled up while the ball was being brought up the court. Players and officials got between them before the scuffle could escalate further.

The Rockets' win streak is their longest since winning eight in a row in November 2019. Houston closed within 1 ½ games of idle Golden State for 10th place and the last play-in spot in the Western Conference.

VanVleet scored 23 points on seven 3-pointers, and Green had 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting in the first half as the Rockets built an 85-55 halftime lead. Houston shot 65% in the first half and was 15 of 24 on 3s.

VanVleet tied James Harden and Chandler Parsons for the single-game franchise record for 3s. Green finished 15 of 22 from the field and was 7 of 11 on 3-pointers.

Jeff Green scored a season-high 21 points, and Dillon Brooks added 12 points for Houston, which shot 56% for the game. The Rockets improved to 35-35, marking the first time they were at .500 since Jan. 13, when they were 19-19.

The symbiotic relationship between educational institutions and businesses has given rise to a paradigm shift in the form of industry-academia collaboration. It is nothing but an interaction between the higher education system and industry to exchange knowledge and technology. It provides organisations with a mix of academic rigour and practical expertise.

Moreover, enterprises nurtured within academic institutions have their workforce from a pool of intellectual talent, united by a shared commitment to solving real-world challenges. Students gain significantly from these companies through industry academia collaborations by aligning with their mission, contributing their perspectives, and actively participating in problem-solving endeavours.

Exposure to the Outer World

Today education is no longer limited to the classroom, collaborations between industry and academia can provide exposure to students in the real-world setting. Often theories which students read from books might not impact the way a real-world setting will. Some recent reports claim that around 81% of students feel that it is important for schools and institutions to offer real company-led projects for better learning. Therefore, collaborative research projects, internships and industry expert-held workshops can help students gain valuable insights into the practical applications of their academic learning. This will help students prepare for the complexities that they might face in the future.

High Opportunities for Employment

Speaking on employment Opportunities, Anoop G Prabhu, CTO & Co-Founder Vehant Technologies, ""One of the most critical concerns for every student who is transitioning from education to the workforce is the employment opportunities afforded by their education. With industry-academia collaboration, students can feel less worried about employment as this collaboration enhances students' employability by providing them with relevant skills and experiences sought by employers. According to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 91% of employers prefer hiring candidates with work experience, which includes co-op and internship programs.

Mentoring & Network Building

Industry-academia collaborations open a window for students to connect with industry experts. This not only exposes students to practical knowledge but also allows them to build professional networks. According to Mentorloop, 97% of people with a mentor say they find the experience to be valuable. Through collaborative projects, students can establish valuable connections that may lead to internships, job opportunities, or mentorship.

Open Access to Advanced Technology

Being able to connect with industry experts students can have open access to cutting-edge technology when industry experts partner with educational institutions. This exposure empowers students to familiarise themselves with industry-standard practices, enhancing their readiness for future career opportunities.

Over the past years, numerous initiatives have been taken by the government to reduce the obstacles that industry academia collaborations face. This includes technology innovation hubs in different sectors, settings of research parks and many more. However, it is important to understand that industry works in a fast-paced world, prioritising products and profits whereas academia focuses on research and education. So while engaging both must have reasonable expectations from each other as well as awareness and sensitivity towards the other's priorities and operating environments to ensure a win-win partnership.

In short, industry-academia collaboration is reshaping the landscape of education by offering students the opportunity to connect with industry experts for real-world projects. As education continues to evolve, fostering strong partnerships between academia and industry will be crucial in preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the professional world.",financialexpress.com,news,The Financial Express,,0.2392156862745098,448947052,18,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_-2024-03-21T135620.557.jpg,

He affirmed that India will not skirt this problem anymore and the mood in the country is not to overlook the issue of terrorism.

The EAM, who is in Singapore as part of his three-nation visit, was speaking at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore on his book 'Why Bharat Matters'.

Speaking at the event, Jaishankar said, ""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...we have been unfortunate, or ill-starred to be blessed with the one we have to our west. How do you deal with a neighbour, who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""

Taking a veiled dig at Pakistan, the EAM said that in the country, terrorism exists almost at ""industry level"" and ""assembly line"".

""It's not a one-off, different countries at different points of time have experienced this. But, a very sustained, almost an industry level, assembly line...people whose job is to do bad things at night,"" he said.

Jaishankar added that India has decided that it will have to find a way to address the problem because dodging it will only invite more trouble.

""I don't have a quick, instantaneous fix, but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore...if we have a problem, we must be honest enough to face up to the problem. If you have to have those discussions, we should, if it's hard to find a solution, we must work through. We should not give the other country free pass...in India the mood is not to overlook terrorism,"" the EAM said.

""If you look at the changes that have happened in the last decade, the great deal of public anger to lack of response to terrorism threat is one factor,"" he added.

Brands Didn't Want to Pay for It.,"When a Swedish startup launched a new material made from recycled textiles in late 2022, the fashion industry hailed it as a game changer in its efforts to lessen its environmental impact.

Last month, the company, Renewcell, filed for bankruptcy. While some big retailers, including H&M and Zara, were enthusiastic backers, not enough brands committed to buying its material. Having misjudged how quickly the fashion industry would switch to more sustainable sourcing, the company was left with a costly factory running far below capacity.

The plight of Renewcell illustrates the fashion industry's hesitancy in adopting new materials that may be better for the environment but typically cost more, at least in the short term. It is also another sign of how some companies are putting less emphasis on green initiatives amid a more challenging economic climate.

""There's a disconnect"" between some companies' stated sustainability ambitions and what they actually do, said Tricia Carey, Renewcell's chief commercial officer. ""Fashion brands have the intention,"" Carey said, ""but many are lacking the road map to make it happen.""

Making clothes uses a large and growing amount of the planet's resources. More than 100 billion garments are produced annually and that number is set to rise by one-third by 2030, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a nonprofit. It says the average garment is worn only 10 times before being discarded, often ending up in the trash. The fashion industry is responsible for as much as 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the United Nations Alliance for Sustainable Fashion.

Fashion brands have come under growing pressure from consumers and regulators to reduce their environmental impact, posing a dilemma for an industry hardwired to keep increasing sales by churning out more clothes.

To burnish their green credentials, brands have encouraged consumers to repair, recycle or sell old clothes rather than throw them away. They have also invested in so-called next-generation materials that promise to use fewer resources and, in some cases, have the potential to be recycled again and again.

Inditex, the parent company of Zara, says it wants a quarter of the fiber it uses to be made from next-generation materials by 2030. To foster new materials, the company has worked with more than 300 startups, also including Renewcell, through a Sustainability Innovation Hub that it set up four years ago.

H&M says it wants recycled fibers to constitute half of the material it uses by 2030. The company has invested in more than 25 sustainability startups, including Renewcell.

So far, the uptake of greener material has been sluggish. Recycled materials made up 7.9% of global fiber production in 2022, down from 8.5% the year before, according to the Textile Exchange, a nonprofit that advocates the adoption of more environmentally friendly materials. Much of that came from recycled plastic bottles, with less than 1% of all fiber coming from recycled textiles.

That's despite next-generation materials attracting more than $3 billion of investment over the past decade, according to the Material Innovation Initiative, with dozens of new-textile companies launched during that time.

Founded in 2012, Renewcell became the first chemical textile-to-textile recycler to start producing material on a commercial scale.

Its material is called Circulose, which is produced by treating old textiles with chemicals to create a cellulose pulp. This is dried into sheets, which fiber producers can then dissolve to produce viscose and other materials that are used to make clothes. Unlike mechanically recycled fibers, which fray and ultimately disintegrate, Renewcell's chemical process breaks old textiles down to the level of individual molecules from which strong, new fibers are made. These can be recycled indefinitely via the same process.

With many fashion companies pledging to invest in new textiles to be more sustainable, Renewcell bet on strong demand for its material.

The company raised $158 million, mostly through a 2020 listing in Stockholm, and invested $125 million to convert an old paper mill in eastern Sweden into a Circulose factory capable of producing 60,000 metric tons a year.

Renewcell also outlined plans for two additional factories that would increase its output sixfold by 2030.

Besides Inditex and H&M, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH committed to buying significant quantities of fiber made from Circulose.

But Renewcell hit a brick wall in talks with other big brands. In meetings, brand executives would often express excitement and agree to pilot projects, only to balk at placing commercial-scale orders, said Carey.

Jolts to the economy, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and shaky consumer confidence had made brands risk averse.

Would-be customers fixated on how fiber made from Circulose cost 20% to 45% more than the virgin fibers they typically bought, as well as uncertainty about integrating a new material into their supply chains, Carey said. Fiber typically accounts for about 5% of the retail price of a finished garment.

Renewcell needed its factory to reach full output quickly to become commercially viable, but it achieved only 30% capacity last year as anticipated orders failed to materialize.

By October, the company was running out of cash, and in January it laid off a quarter of its 130 staff. It filed for bankruptcy in February after failing to secure fresh investment.

Renewcell is now seeking a buyer to repay its debts and restart production.

The company's predicament is a grim sign for a clothing industry that claims to want to transform itself, said Claire Bergkamp, managing director of the Textile Exchange.

""My hope is this will be a wake-up call for the industry,"" she said.

Unless fashion companies commit to paying higher prices for new, greener materials, other fiber startups could also struggle, Bergkamp added.

While the transition from gasoline cars to electric vehicles has benefited from billions of dollars in subsidies, the move to new textiles has received practically no government support, making startups reliant on private funding.

That has left some big clothing companies, notably H&M and Inditex, shouldering a relatively large share of the burden of supporting new-material startups.

H&M invested in Renewcell in 2017 and was the first retailer to launch products containing Circulose. It currently sells around three dozen products containing the material.

The retailer wanted to invest more but decided not to commit more cash in recent weeks because of the lack of support from other companies, said H&M Chief Executive Daniel Ervér.

Earlier this month, H&M announced a new investment in Syre, a startup developing a polyester-fabric recycling process, and pledged to buy $600 million worth of its material over seven years -- assuming it achieves commercial production.

Demand for recycled polyester is already established, with material made from recycled bottles already commonly used to make clothes. But textile-to-textile recycled polyester is similar to Circulose in that the technology is untested at scale.

To drive a shift to next-generation materials, other companies need to invest and commit to buying new textiles at scale, Ervér said.

""H&M alone cannot provide the scale that is required,"" Ervér said. ""The industry needs to commit.""",livemint.com,news,mint,,0.1215686274509804,448946854,1,https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/03/24/600x338/im-940430_1711250346370_1711250479094.jpg,

But in Anguilla, a tiny Caribbean island to the east of Puerto Rico, the AI boom has made the country a fortune.

The British territory collects a fee from every registration for Internet addresses that end in "".ai"", which happens to be the domain name assigned to the island, like "".fr"" for France and "".jp"" for Japan. With companies wanting Internet addresses that communicate that they are at the forefront of the AI boom - such as Mr Elon Musk's X.ai website for his AI company - Anguilla has recently received a huge influx in requests for domain names.

For each domain registration, Anguilla's government gets anywhere from US$140 ($190) to thousands of dollars from website names sold at auctions, according government data. In 2023, Anguilla's government made about US$32 million from those fees. That amounted to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product for the territory of almost 16,000 people and 90.6 sq km.

""Some people call it a windfall,"" said Anguilla Premier Ellis Webster. ""We just call it God smiling down on us.""

Mr Webster said the government used the money to provide free health care for citizens 70 and older, and it has committed millions of dollars to finish building a school and a vocational training centre. The government has also allocated funds to improve its airport; doubled its budget for sports activities, events and facilities; and increased the budget for citizens seeking medical treatment overseas, he said.

The island, which relies heavily on tourism, had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic's restrictions on travel and a devastating hurricane in 2017. The .ai domain income was the boost the country needed.

""We never thought that it would have this potential,"" Mr Webster said.

Anguilla's control of .ai dates to the early days of the Internet, when nations and territories were assigned their slice of cyberspace. Anguilla received .ai, and its government, whose own site is www.gov.ai., did not make much of it until the domain names started bringing in millions. Officials are uncertain how long the boon will last, but they predicted 2024 would bring in similar income as 2023 from domain names.

It is not the first bonanza to make a big difference to a grateful domain owner. Tuvalu, a string of islands north-west of Australia, sold the rights to its suffix, "".tv,"" to a Canadian entrepreneur for US$50 million, and used the money to bring electricity to the outer islands, create scholarships and finance the process to join the United Nations.

The South Pacific island of Niue, on the other hand, gave an American businessman the rights to its "".nu"" suffix in the 1990s in exchange for connecting it to the Internet. The island later claimed to have been cheated out of cash that came through the sale of the domain name to thousands of Scandinavians attracted by the suffix ""nu,"" which means ""now"" in Swedish, Danish and Dutch.

But Anguilla realised early enough that it could not let this unexpected jackpot slip away.",straitstimes.com,news,The Straits Times,,0.1372549019607843,448946513,1,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/03/24/ANGUILLAAIFORTUNE.JPG,eng-9421216

In remarks made at a media stakeholders conference organised by the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe (MAZ) in Harare last Thursday, Mafukidze said the Zimbabwean media cannot continue to operate in silos in order to be competitive.

""The media must regroup from the base. We need to be cognisant of how digital technologies have revolutionised how audiences consume news and information,"" said Mafukidze.

""If the media does not adapt to the realities that the target audiences could be outside of their geographical bounds, then the sector could easily become irrelevant.""

He said the environment should be conducive for any player to invest into the sector and that the licensing framework needs to be reviewed.

""Broadcasting licenses should just be readily available,"" Mafukidze said.

""In any event, you can't restrict content creation neither can you stop audiences from following whatever content they want online.""

The conference brought together various stakeholders ranging from media entrepreneurs, media executives, academia, professional associations for editors and journalists, legislators, government and international development partners.

MAZ coordinator Nigel Nyamutumbu said that the conference sought to prioritise areas for interventions to develop the media sector.

""The meeting is a product of a series of consultations, firstly within the MAZ network and then to a wide range of actors. From this process, it emerged that media sustainability, policy and law reforms are critical in transforming the Zimbabwean media sector to an industry,"" Nyamutumbu said.

""There's consensus to relook at the operational environment and to proactively safeguard the media from the harsh realities of an economic recession and threats of digitisation.

""Of equal importance is the need for journalists to be professional and to ensure that the operating environment is conducive for journalism to thrive.

""It is also important to build leadership and institutional capacities of the media in order for the media to enhance its role as enabler of citizens rights.""

He revealed that MAZ will convene thematic area meetings as part of a process to co-create solutions for the media, beginning with a media sustainability summit set for April 10 in Harare.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,,0.09019607843137245,448946136,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/thestandard/uploads/2024/03/lKqYk394VCwaymyjuZbb0BEnB0TMuK29cII6ULFn.gif,

Highlights The Western Conference playoffs feature a big three of Nuggets, Thunder, and Timberwolves, with tight seeding battles below. The Houston Rockets, led by Jalen Green, are on fire, challenging the Warriors for the final Play-In spot in the West. Green's improved efficiency and hot streak could see the Rockets knocking the Warriors out of the postseason.

This year's Western Conference Playoffs feature a front-loaded big three of the Denver Nuggets, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Minnesota Timberwolves. Behind them are several teams grappling for seeding, with teams trying to stay afloat and avoid the NBA Play-In Tournament.

The Play-In presently features a lineup of future Hall of Famers in LeBron James, Luka Dončić, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry, but Curry and the Golden State Warriors are in serious danger of missing the tournament entirely, thanks to the meteoric rise of the Houston Rockets.

Despite missing Alperen Sengun, the Rockets are on fire, winning all eight of their last games after dispatching the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. Fred VanVleet posted a historical stat line, but Houston firmly belongs to Jalen Green.

Behind Green's five-game averages of 34.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a remarkably efficient 50 percent from three and 56.4 percent from the floor, the Houston Rockets are only one and a half games behind the Warriors for the final spot in the West's Play-In Tournament.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jalen Green has scored 40 points twice in the last three games, the only two times he has this season.

Jalen Green Has Arrived The third-year player is living up to the hype that got him drafted second overall in 2021

Jalen Green has gained a reputation as an inefficient volume scorer who doesn't play defense, and his numbers usually back that up. While he is capable of getting blisteringly hot, he tends to take more shots than he should and was one of the most inefficient scorers in the game.

As of late, he's shown Rockets' fans why he was selected second overall in the 2021 NBA Draft, and he's been one of the best players in the league when the Rockets need him most.

Green's accomplishments propelled him to be named the Western Conference Player of the Week. The Rockets are only a game and a half behind the Warriors, and the Warriors are not nearly as hot as Houston is. The Rockets have won nine of the last ten, whereas the Warriors have gone 4-6 in that span.

A postseason without Stephen Curry is a nightmare situation for the NBA, but the young, savvy, and smartly-led Rockets are making some noise out West, and they could easily supplant the Warriors as the last team invited to the postseason.

If the Rockets do make the Play-In, it will be win-or-go-home, but for the hottest team in basketball, there's really no situation they'd rather be in.

After Aaron Rodgers moved to the New York Jets last season, Love took over the reins at the Packers and certainly lived up to expectations. During the regular season, Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns, leading Green Bay to a 9-8 record - and a spot in the playoffs.

In the wild card round, Love put on an amazing performance, helping the Packers to a surprise away win over the Dallas Cowboys. The Packers nearly beat the San Francisco 49ers to secure a place in the NFC Championship Game, but fell just short - however, fans are buzzing for the Love era.

The 25 year old turned around the 6-8 record with three straight wins at the end, and his ability to play his best when it matters most is truly impressive. As a result, Love is not holding back his hopes for 2024 - he believes the Packers can compete and win the Super Bowl.

""It's a great feeling, man,"" Love said during an appearance on 'The Pivot Podcast'. ""We're all very hungry for this upcoming year. Like you said, the confidence from top to bottom is there.

""The organisation believes that it's the perfect time to have a chance to win a Super Bowl this year. Those conversations we had after that 49ers game were 'Work harder, try and find ways to get better, because next year we're gonna do it,' There's no more 'we're a young team,' there's no more of those what ifs. People know what we're about now. Obviously, we'll have that target on our back now, people are gonna want to beat us. We're hungry.""

Jordan Love's form late in the season ensured the Packers reached the NFL playoffs

With Super Bowl dreams growing, the Packers quickly added quality to their team in free agency. Green Bay signed 2021 rushing champion Josh Jacobs to a four-year deal worth $48 million, before moving for former New York Giants safety Xavier McKinney.

Love added: ""I know everybody in that locker room is hungry and ready to get back. And obviously, we added some key pieces with Josh Jacobs and Xavier McKinney. So I'm excited.""

""We're going to have some more pieces coming in with the draft, but I'm excited for me to be able to take that next step. Year 2. For a lot of the receivers, those rookies we had last year to take that step in Year 2.""

Yet, crafting effective policies requires a strong foundation of evidence and knowledge. This is where knowledge generation comes into play.

In this article, there is an exploration of how effectively harnessing the power of knowledge creation can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact.

Strategies for leveraging knowledge generation for policy impact

Specifically, sector impact evaluation programmes should be scaled up. This involves deploying a team of research and operational staff to collaboratively develop data and analysis, including through impact evaluation, to inform future sector-specific operations. In tandem, country research programs, which help develop the underlying data ecosystem and enhance the capacity to use advanced analytics to improve efficiency in government processes, should be expanded. Increasing the scope of these efforts would help reduce the costs of generating and disseminating knowledge by fostering long-term relationships with client governments and other in-country evidence partners, and in turn, help overcome challenges related to generating and sustaining demand for high-quality evidence.

ince impact evaluation currently depends on insufficient and at times uncertain external trust fund resources and fragmented operational interest, new dedicated resources are needed to undertake evaluations more strategically and systematically. The leadership could consider different financing mechanisms, each with their benefits and drawbacks.

There are several options for financing impact evaluation and related evidence activities. One option in low-income countries is to designate a share of the regional International Development Association (IDA) window for data and evaluation functions, including impact evaluation.

Where feasible, this funding could be used to support national evaluation and evidence entities in both the public and private sectors. Dedicating a relatively small portion of IDA resources to evaluation-related functions would enhance the overall impact, and therefore represent good value for money.

Another option in both low- and middle-income countries is to establish a defined allocation of IDA lending towards data and research for all financed operations. Integrating these essential functions across all lending operations would help generate data and evidence that is operationally relevant and responsive to a client country's decision-making needs. However, this approach could also introduce some risks; bundling knowledge production and lending functions may raise concerns related to conflict of interest when governments are both judge and jury of evaluation results, necessitating the need for an approval structure where researchers review the available evidence base before loan approval.

Third, the development partners for instance World Bank should also continue to produce research and evidence, including through trust funds, in addition to systematically integrating funding for data and evaluation-related activities into operations.

As such, trust funds should be adequately funded to support evaluations and related evidence functions that are not necessarily project-specific, including studies that measure longer-term outcomes beyond the time horizon of a specific operation, are regionally focused, and/or relate to global public goods.

Data repositories can help decrease the cost and increase the speed of knowledge generation. Tapping into tax data, current data, and other administrative data sources would also help make evidence generation faster and cheaper, but requires greater investments in data collection, quality, and infrastructure (including national statistical systems) to link these data sources to each other and make them accessible and usable for researchers and policymakers.

More equitable evidence-to-policy partnerships would increase the quality, relevance, and visibility of development partner's research and evaluation work within client governments, national universities, and civil society groups, as well as at the global level. While the development partners already pursue numerous partnerships with external research organizations that play a critical role in capacity strengthening and demand generation, there is scope to expand. The development partners currently contract country-based survey firms through one-off consultancy agreements, including through vendor shortlisting and open competition.

Where feasible, the development partners should shift to providing medium-term financing for select organizations with the potential to build their evaluation capacity and expand their client base to interested governments and other research funders.

The development partners could also co-invest with partner research organizations in local evaluation firms to further develop the enabling ecosystem for evidence generation and use, though current procurement rules would likely need to be changed.

Further, the development partners can provide policy lending to support government-based or semi-autonomous evidence-to-policy initiatives, which are proximate to information on policy windows and ideally structured by design to ensure research questions align with government priorities.

Lastly, creating an internal roster of local partners in client countries including universities, researchers, research consortia, and survey firms would be a helpful resource for staff as they seek to expand the scope of impact evaluations and related evidence activities.

Furthermore, incorporate diverse perspectives by including stakeholders like industry experts, NGOs, and community representatives in the knowledge generation process.

In conclusion, the power of knowledge generation lies not just in its creation, but in its translation to actionable insights. By fostering collaboration between knowledge producers and policymakers, employing targeted communication strategies, and building robust knowledge ecosystems, we can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact. This virtuous cycle of knowledge informing policy and policy driving further research will equip us to tackle complex challenges and create a more informed and equitable future. As the world continues to evolve, our ability to leverage knowledge generation effectively will be paramount in ensuring that policy decisions are not simply well-intentioned, but demonstrably effective.

There is need not only to rethink but also to restructure the health sector towards innovative medical innovation.

At the same time, we are trying to answer if entrepreneurial health practices are for business or a calling that turns out to be a free gift from our sons and daughters to ensure societal well-being.

We say there is a need to strike a balance.

While a number of health professionals in Zimbabwe have started shaking up the industry with innovative approaches, there is still much room for improvement in the healthcare sector.

In order to achieve an upper-middle income society by 2023 and attain the (Sustainable Development Goals) SDGs, the country is looking for health entrepreneurs who are driven, adaptable, and willing to think outside the box to revolutionise the healthcare system.

And such should possess qualities for resilience, creativity, professionalism, and ethics, as well as a deep understanding of the local healthcare landscape and its unique challenges.

Factoring into account that we exist in a cosmopolitan global society, whatever innovation we make should cater to a multi-ethnic society.

As aforementioned, being able to go far from confined entrepreneurial and medical practices to contemporary new realities accompanied by a generational sustainability mindset.

As we try to answer the question if the health industry is primarily a business or a humanitarian endeavour for entrepreneurs. We are further led to do a scrutiny analysis of the approaches and priorities of health entrepreneurs.

The health industry, particularly the for-profit private sector, can be seen as a blend of both business and humanitarian efforts, as entrepreneurs have the opportunity to make a positive impact on society while also generating profits.

Balancing financial sustainability with social responsibility is crucial for long-term success in the sector.

Now, let's delve into the innovations and disruptive healthcare models that health entrepreneurs could leverage to further their sustainable investments and drive positive change in the industry.

Innovations in the healthcare industry are focused primarily on improving patient outcomes, increasing access to care, and reducing costs.

The traditional health delivery models have been organised around a disease or a specialty (family medicine, orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology, etc.), but the future of healthcare lies in patient-centred models that prioritise preventive care, personalised medicine, and holistic approaches to wellness.

The last decade has witnessed the emergence of medical centres, group practices, and specialist centres across the country.

While some have been successful in innovating the way healthcare is delivered, others continue with the traditional models with little to no improvement.

Disruptive healthcare models could be a game changer in the health industry and aim to transform the status quo by offering unique and effective solutions to health delivery.

With adequate local and global regulation by health authorities, these could be achieved by:

Leveraging Artificial intelligence (AI) to personalise care and tailor stepped-care models for individual patients. AI can be used to establish AI-powered algorithms that could analyse patient data to recommend which patients receive which level of intervention. This could facilitate differentiated service delivery (DSD), with less intensive support for those doing well and more intensive support for those with greater needs. AI can also be used to streamline administrative processes in healthcare as well as improve diagnostic accuracy.

Remote monitoring technologies can be adapted to help individuals manage chronic conditions. These technologies may include wearable devices for tracking vital signs, mobile apps for medication adherence, and telehealth platforms for virtual consultations. These could help health care providers remotely monitor patients' health status and intervene when necessary.

Innovating knowledge management systems in health care could improve information sharing among healthcare professionals and enhance patient care coordination. Additionally, integrating artificial intelligence into electronic health records can help identify trends in patient data and improve treatment outcomes.

Effective use of patient relationship management systems to profile and track patient progress can also be enhanced through AI technology. These tools can also be used to manage appointments, analyse patient preferences, and personalise communication to improve patient engagement and satisfaction.

Scaling up group practices through establishing collaborative care models involving a team-based approach where providers (GPs with different areas of interest or different specialists) work together to provide comprehensive health care, often using a shared care plan and effective communication channels. This approach has been shown to increase efficiency in delivering healthcare services and can help address the growing demand for primary care services in many countries.

Accountable Care Organisations (ACOs) involve networks of healthcare providers and hospitals that collaborate to provide coordinated care to patients with the goal of improving quality, enhancing patient experience, and reducing healthcare costs. These promote collaboration rather than competition and address the fragmentation of care that can occur when patients see multiple providers for different aspects of their health. ACOs also focus on preventive care and population health management to improve overall community health outcomes. ACOs are often reimbursed based on the quality and outcomes they deliver, sometimes referred to as value-based care. As long as these align with the anti-competitive regulations set forth by the Competition Act [Chapter 14:28] (the Act) , ACOs can provide high-quality, cost-effective care to their patients.

Concierge medicine is a healthcare model where patients pay a membership fee or retainer to a primary physician in exchange for enhanced access and personalised care. This allows for 24/7 direct physician access and a focus on preventive and wellness-oriented care. It is being practiced in various countries, with the U.S. being one of the prominent adopters. Other countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, also have practitioners offering concierge medicine services. These services may vary in scope and cost, but they all aim to provide a higher level of service and attention to patients. Concierge medicine has been growing in popularity as patients seek more personalised and convenient healthcare options.

Green health for sustainability, which involves the incorporation of environmentally friendly practices into healthcare delivery, such as reducing waste, using renewable energy sources, and promoting green spaces within medical facilities.

Wellness tourism could combine healthcare services with travel experiences to promote overall well-being and relaxation. This emerging trend allows individuals to prioritise their health while enjoying unique destinations and activities.

Integration of teletherapy and digital mental health platforms into health services can be a key strategy to reach a larger audience and provide convenient access to mental health support for those who may not have access to traditional in-person therapy.

This shift in mindset can lead to greater success and impact in the medical sector.

Hence, it is only by focusing on improving products or services rather than worrying about external conditions that health entrepreneurs can truly make a difference in the industry and improve overall health outcomes for individuals.

Why is it the Future in the Banking Industry,"Imagine a world where financial transactions are secure, transparent, and efficient. No more waiting days for checks to clear or worrying about fraud. This is the promise of blockchain technology, a revolutionary system that is poised to transform the banking industry.

In this article, we'll break down blockchain technology into easy-to-understand concepts. We'll explore what it is, how it works, and why it's considered the future of banking. We'll also delve into some real-world examples to solidify your understanding.

So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the fascinating world of blockchain!

At its core, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. Think of it as a giant, shared spreadsheet that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike a traditional spreadsheet, however, this ledger is secure and tamper-proof. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Blockchain offers several advantages over traditional methods of storing and managing data. Here are some of the key benefits:

Imagine you are sending money to a friend online. Traditionally, the transaction would involve your bank, your friend's bank, and potentially a clearinghouse. Each intermediary would need to verify the transaction, leading to delays and fees.

With blockchain, the transaction would be directly recorded on a shared ledger accessible to all participants. Here's how it would work:

This entire process can happen in a matter of seconds, eliminating the need for intermediaries and significantly speeding up the transaction.

While banking is one of the most promising areas for blockchain adoption, its applications extend far beyond finance. Here are a few examples:

Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly disrupt the banking industry, but it is unlikely to completely replace traditional banks. Here's why:

The More Likely Scenario: A Hybrid Approach

Instead of a complete overhaul, the future of banking is likely to see a hybrid approach where blockchain technology is integrated with existing banking systems. Here are some potential ways this might play out:

Despite its immense potential, blockchain technology is still in its early stages of development. Here are some challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur:

Blockchain technology holds immense promise for the future of banking. By offering enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency, blockchain can revolutionize the way we conduct financial transactions. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of blockchain are undeniable.

The third level of bannable speech - 'malinformation' - is defined as factually accurate, true speech that is deemed to be taken out of or lacking context,"" the report said.

Second on the list was the ""suppression"" of the Hunter Biden laptop.

It was the New York Post that documented scandalous details about the Biden family's business dealings uncovered in the laptop.

""This would spark the most impactful coordinated act of censorship in the 2020 election, with Twitter and Facebook both suppressing the story, hampering its virality and preventing it from reaching millions of Americans,"" the report said.

Ultimately, Joe Biden won the election, but a polling after said had details about the scandals contained in that laptop been reported routinely, Biden almost certainly would have lost.

Further, it was revealed that the censorship of that story came after the FBI interfered in the election, warning media companies to suppress the information.

Next on the list were discussions about the now-confirmed multiple and sometimes dangerous side effects of the COVID shots.

""In an email exposed through the Twitter Files, members of the Virality Project can be seen recommending censorship of 'stories of true vaccine side effects' and 'true posts which could fuel hesitancy,'"" the report said.

Also connected to the COVID pandemic were discussions about the effectiveness of the government-mandated masks, and they were censored.

""In 2021, YouTube removed a video from Senator Rand Paul because he called the efficacy of masks into question,"" the report said.

And then there were the stories, the narratives: ""By targeting entire narratives rather than individual posts, the censorship industry can censor at scale, regardless of the intent or factual accuracy of individual posts. One example is the Pennsylvania Poll Watcher story, a narrative targeted by the Election Integrity Partnership in 2020 that resulted in over 600,000 tweets being flagged.""

Benz, in a 2022 report in election censorship, explained, ""As just one example of the myriad tricks EIP used to shoehorn in censorship of election discussions, in highlights above, you'll see that EIP labeled the entire narrative surrounding a Pennsylvania poll worker's denial of entry into a polling station as being 'misinformation.' Their reasoning does not even deny the basic facts of the denial of entry, but rather makes a subjective determination about the political motivations behind the narrative.""

No. 6 on the list was censorship of ""mistrust of the media,"" and No. 7 was the censorship of scientists who assembled the Great Barrington Declaration.

""While the censorship industry's efforts to maintain control over COVID-19 narratives have often caught ordinary Americans in its crosshairs, medical professionals and experts were not immune. A group of epidemiologists from Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration in the fall of 2020, advocating against broad lockdown policies in favor of a targeted approach aimed at protecting those most vulnerable to the virus,"" the report said.

""Simply advancing a theory and an alternative policy prescription can't be characterized as 'misinformation,' ... the Barrington Declaration authors and their supporters were immediately targeted.""

Also cited was ""The Sunrise Movement,"" a series of Zoom calls in which ""liberal activists"" allegedly schemed to ""ferment chaos in the wake of a potential Trump victory or a contested election.""

Also cited was the censorship of anything described as a ""delegitimization narrative,"" or anything that could cast doubt on the integrity of election process, no matter the evidence.

Benz has reported that is ""defined to mean any speech that 'casts doubt' on any kind of election process, outcome or integrity issues.""

Last were comparisons of COVID to flu. That opinion, now apparently adopted be even DHS, encouraged ""family members to report each other for stating the mere opinion that 'COVID-19 is no worse than the flu.'""

The meeting, jointly chaired by Sardar Tahir Mehmood, President of FORP, and Chairman Mussart Ejaz Khan, focused on devising strategies for the upcoming budget for 2024-25 and anticipating challenges posed by the IMF programme.

Members engaged in extensive discussions, demonstrating their dedication to finding viable solutions.

During the session, it was decided to facilitate and assist the government in finding ways to enhance revenue without further burdening the real estate sector.

Recognising the importance of inclusive policies, it was emphasised that involving stakeholders ensures the smooth implementation of policies without causing disruptions.

The real estate and construction industries can play a significant role in reviving the economy during these challenging times.

Furthermore, it was decided in the meeting to engage the entire real estate community across Pakistan, including chambers and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), as well as political leadership, to effectively convey our collective concerns in the best interest of Pakistan.

These policy measures aim to attract both local and overseas investors to participate in the ""Build Pakistan"" initiative.

Previous policies have adversely affected our country, with billions of dollars invested by Pakistanis in the UAE alone.

However, we remain optimistic about our country's future and are committed to contributing to its well-being, just as we did when the country was on the grey list.

Under the umbrella of the Federation of Realtors Pakistan, the real estate community is encouraged to enroll as Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) to fulfil our international obligations.

The Federation of Realtors Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to advocating for the interests of the real estate sector and contributing to the prosperity of Pakistan.",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,0.3647058823529412,448945612,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-03-24/l_1171695_060123_updates.jpg,

Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore, made these remarks during a Q&A round held post his lecture session on his authored book 'Why Bharat Matters' at Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of National University of Singapore (NUS).

""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...if nothing else you want at least a quiet neighbourhood,"" he said in response to a question on India's ties with Pakistan.

However, unfortunately, it is not the same with India, he said.

Underlining that Pakistan has been sponsoring terrorism against India, Jaishankar asked, ""How do you deal with a neighbour who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""

""It's not a one-off happening...but very sustained, almost at an industry level...So what we have come to conclude is that we have to find a way of addressing (the menace), that dodging the problem gets us nowhere, it only invites more trouble,"" he said.

""I don't have a quick instantaneous fix (to this issue). But what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore. We are not going to say, 'well, that happened and let's continue our dialogue'...we have a problem and we must be honest enough to face up to that problem, however difficult it is...we should not give the other country a free pass, saying there's nothing they can do about it or it's a very hard problem, or there's so much else at stake that let us overlook,"" he asserted.

The study by a group of geographers and environmental scientists revealed the increase in temperature in districts with high susceptibility to forest fires compounded by local practices and over-exploitation of natural resources, including water, and clearing of forests for mining, industrial, and agricultural purposes may lead to increased temperatures and reduced relative humidity conditions conducive to forest fires.

Central, southern, northwestern, northern, and some northeastern parts of Odisha, including Angul, Kandhamal, Rayagada, Kalahandi, Koraput, Sundargarh, and Mayurbhanj have been identified as very high to high forest fire susceptibility zones.

As per an analysis, the state recorded 85,307 forest fire incidents between 2001 and 2022, averaging 3,877 fires annually and showing a general upward trend in forest fire occurrences with a notable increase after 2015. Odisha is the fourth-largest state in terms of forest cover, with 52,156 sq km of forest land.

A total 28,286 forest fires were reported during 2001-2010, accounting for approximately 33.16% of the total incidents. The number significantly escalated to 57,021 between 2011 and 2022, constituting 66.84% of all recorded cases.

The northern division, encompassing Angul, Sambalpur, Sundargarh, Rayagada, Kandhamal, Kalahandi, Gajapati, Koraput, and Malkangiri, along with Mayurbhanj in the southern division consistently showed higher incidences of forest fires. Angul district emerges as the most affected area, having recorded 14,009 incidents in past 22 years. In the fire season from January to May, on an average the highest 1,463 incidents were recorded in March with a record-breaking 4,236 forest fires in March 2021 alone. The pre-monsoon season, spanning January to May, accounted for 67.73% of the total forest fires in the state.

Green had a game-high 41 points while shooting 15-of-22 from the field (68.2%) and 7-of-11 on 3-pointers (63.6%). Meanwhile, VanVleet added 34 points on 11-of-16 shooting (68.8%) and 10-of-15 from 3-point range (66.7%), tying the all-time franchise record for makes from 3-point range in a game.

Led by VanVleet and Green in the backcourt, the Rockets connected on 27-of-49 from 3-point range (55.1%), falling one make short of the team's all-time record (28) of made 3s in a single game.

After losing Jabari Smith Jr. to an early ejection (due to a physical altercation involving Utah's Kris Dunn, who was also ejected), veteran big man Jeff Green took on some additional minutes for the Rockets and scored 21 points in 25 minutes, shooting 7-of-14 overall (50.0%) and 4-of-8 on 3-pointers (50.0%).

Houston is now 10-1 in March, which leads the entire NBA.

The Jazz (29-42) were led in defeat by veteran forward John Collins, who tallied 25 points in 20 minutes while making 7-of-9 shots (77.8%), 2-of-2 from 3-point range, and 9-of-10 free throws (90.0%).

Here's our look back at Saturday night's highlights and postgame interviews, along with reaction by media members and fans. As Houston's homestand concludes, next up is Monday's game versus Portland (19-51). Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. Central.

Some students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee told FOX6 News they still spend a lot of time in the digital world, which experts said can come at a cost.

""We weren't able to go to school, still be there and still be engaged, so it was just hard,"" said Jordan Lemon.

When it's at your fingertips, it's hard not to scroll. Three first-year students at UWM said they probably spend around five hours on their phones each day, maybe more - but those numbers were even higher during the pandemic.

""I looked back at my phone history, and I don't even remember the last posts,"" said Bryce Ryan.

Between social isolation and online learning, Dr. Tyler Rickers with Rogers Behavioral Health said they are still seeing the impact lockdown left on teens and young adults.

""Just watching somebody do it on a screen or talk about it on a screen isn't as effective,"" said Rickers. ""Decreased social abilities, the education isn't quite as good, and some of them haven't necessarily had the consequences.""

Rickers said all those factors can cause mental health challenges such as anger, depression, anxiety and frustration. However, that does not mean there isn't hope.

""Just because it's the way you feel now doesn't mean it's the way you are always going to feel,"" he said.

For those feeling lost, Rickers recommends scrolling less and looking up at the world more: ""Don't go down the rabbit holes.

At the Big Ten tournament, the sophomore guard from Victoria, Minnesota, took five charges over the four games, many coming in big moments of the game.

Then during Nebraska's 61-59 win against Texas A&M in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday she did it again. With 61 seconds left in a tie game, Hake drew a charge.

""I love taking charges, and I was in the right place at the right time,"" Hake said. ""That was a big momentum shifter. I had to throw the bones, of course - shout-out Blackshirts.""

Right after Hake's charge, Alexis Markowski scored to give Nebraska a lead.

""I think everyone stepped up and made game-winning plays,"" Hake said.

Shelley loves how Nebraska is playing

Nebraska point guard Jaz Shelley feels like the Huskers can beat any team in the NCAA Tournament, and she's armed with a solid list of reasons to defend her claim.

""I think we're really good at locking into scout,"" Shelley said. ""Our team has really good focus. We have a really high IQ team. We're able to guard and keep people below their averages. And I think we show up in big moments. We have people that can step up off the bench, and we trust everyone on this team.""

Pep band on the move

Marching band season is over, but the Nebraska pep band was on the move during Friday's game.

There was a mix up on what side of the arena the band and spirit squads should be, so Texas A&M and Nebraska each had their bands in the wrong spot for the first few songs they played.

So early in the first quarter the bands flipped sides to be closer to their team's bench and fans.

There wasn't time to pack up and set up the drum kit, so each drummer just used the other band's kit.

Nebraska's drummer, Conor Maguire of Fort Collins, Colorado, didn't mind, and said part of A&M's drum set may have even sounded better than the one he was using.

""I'm just happy to be here,"" he said.

The band got to travel on the charter airplane with the team.

Great sports week for Hake family

Hake plays basketball. Her older brother, Carson, plays baseball at North Dakota State.

The North Dakota State baseball team actually played Nebraska in Lincoln on Wednesday, but Hake wasn't able to be there to watch and she was glad she wasn't. Nebraska won 3-2. Hake played first base.

The Nebraska basketball team had already left for Corvallis and the NCAA Tournament. Hake did get to watch her brother play in Omaha last weekend.

Her parents were at the baseball game in Lincoln, and then flew to Oregon on Friday morning.

Hake is thrilled to be playing in the NCAA Tournament for the first time.

""You work for the Big Dance,"" she said. ""You wait to hear your name called in March.""

Injury came on radar late

Texas A&M had to play without starter Lauren Ware, a 6-foot-5 forward, due to an ankle injury. That was a big hit -- she averages nine points and seven rebounds, blocks shots and can score on the fast break.

And while it may have helped Nebraska for the Aggies not to have one of its starters, it also took some time for Nebraska to adjust to what it had planned for.

Nebraska coach Amy Williams didn't find out until just before the game the Ware wouldn't be playing.

""I got a text message from my staff while I was in the locker room writing on the board the keys to the game, saying she's in a boot and not playing. That's when we knew,"" Williams said.

Free throw advantage

In a three-point win against the Aggies, Nebraska was 19-for-22 at the free throw line, including 7 for 8 in the fourth quarter. Logan Nissley got the winning point on a free throw with 14 seconds left.

""I'm just proud of that,"" Williams said. ""I think (Markowski) kind of started us off, and Lex went 6 for 6 from the free-throw line, and then down the stretch we had the right people there -- Logan, Jaz. They're very confident free-throw shooters. And so those two stepping up and making the big ones under pressure were good and just important.""

Nebraska outscored the Aggies by 11 from the line.

Oregon State coach familiar with Shelley

Oregon State coach Scott Rueck knows Nebraska's point guard well.

First, he made a trip to Shelley's home in Australia to recruit her. And then when Shelley began her career at Oregon, Oregon State played against her.

Just like Nebraska fans, Rueck has seen that Shelley can take over a game in many ways -- defense, amazing passes, making 3-pointers.

""I had watched her play for Australia -- not on the stats sheet -- yet she was the one making the plays,"" Rueck said. ""When they needed her to play big, I think she put 25 on the U.S. in a game, and all of a sudden she rose to a level that nobody had seen.""",omaha.com,news,Omaha.com,,0.1843137254901961,448945224,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/84/9849215d-8764-5938-84de-01c37357c440/65ff950eeb6ef.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9419713

Samir Bordoloi & his green commandos make farming cool again,"""I tell them to drop these yams wherever they please. They attract animals like wild boars. Then come the leopards. We planted banana trees, and bamboo, and in came the elephants,"" says Bordoloi.

Nestled in a lush forest in Sonapur's Rupnagar, a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Assam's capital Guwahati, is his Farm Learning Centre and Food Forest. It serves as the Green Commandos' base camp and it's making farming cool again.

Eight years in the making, this centre has played a pivotal role in drawing youth -- not just from Sonapur but from across the Northeast -- back to the joys of farming as a livelihood, which, in Bordoloi's words, is not a ""glamourised profession"".

It all started when Bordoloi, an Ashoka fellow from the 2020 batch who describes himself as a 'compassionate farmer' on LinkedIn, was approached by a group of farmers from the Bodo tribe in 2016.

""They told me they had a piece of land in Sonapur, far away from their villages, which was susceptible to the land mafia. They asked if I could help them with farming there. It was basically a big forest. So I wondered, why cut down a forest and resort to mono-cropping when we can grow local food of various kinds?"" he recalls.

Bordoloi, who completed his Bachelor's degree in Agricultural and Extension Education Services from the Assam Agricultural University in Jorhat in 1997, realised early that organic farming was his calling -- he preferred the practical to the theoretical. He began to travel to villages across the Northeast to gain more exposure to farming practices.

Inspired by what he saw, he began to realise that his mission was to help farmers become stakeholders in the 'seeds to feed' cycle, by championing native fruits, vegetables and herbs for self-sustenance as well as a means of income. Farm Learning Centre and Food Forest at Sonapur is one of his key projects to achieve this. Bordoloi lives in Rupnagar, and all his income comes from the forest.

Why cut down a forest and resort to mono-cropping when we can grow local food of various kinds

- Samir Bordoloi, founder, Farm Learning Centre and Food Forest

Today, this multi-storey food forest is home to over 5,000 species of local plants. The farmers grow everything from king chillies to gourds, pumpkin, roselle and squash at zero cost. No pesticides or insecticides are used, only natural compost. No tilling is done, and all of the resources this forest provides are reused, and recycled.

""One of the biggest reasons for rural-to-urban migration is because farming is not a glamourised profession. A kid does not want to be a farmer. Because food is corporatised, and there is an attempt to control the value chain,"" he says.

In this, inherited food cultures are lost, he adds. ""You will always be connected to the food you ate many years ago with your grandparents, that emotion will show in your eyes. But we don't pass that on to our children. We are losing the traditional food system.""

It is from this mission that the 'Green Commandos' programme was born in 2017. The three-week module is ""army-style"" training. ""We first do three days of camping, we make them run, we make them do squats,"" says Bordoloi.

Then he sends them off into the forest, armed with yams, and 'seed bombs' (mud balls packed with seeds). ""Later, they go back and are delighted to see the plants growing where they dropped the seed bombs,"" says Bordoloi.

Today, the forest is frequented by a herd of elephants every year. They too play a crucial role. The route they take is where Bordoloi and his team of 'agripreneurs' have planted bamboo trees, pineapple, turmeric and king chillies. ""The elephants walk over the turmeric, crushing it into chunks on the way. A customer bought that crushed turmeric online for Rs 500/kg!"" he says.

Moreover, when the elephants reach up to the bamboo shoots, they loosen leaves that then fall onto the forest floor. This becomes mulch for the king chilli plants.

Pointing to a nearby village, he says its residents once came to felicitate him. ""They thanked me, saying, 'Because the elephants go through this forest now, they don't come into our village and damage our rice crop'.""

Bordoloi has trained over 2,000 Green Commandos so far. And last year, he mentored four Green Hub-Royal Enfield Responsible Tourism (RT) fellows. The six-month RT fellowship aims to uplift community youth through training sessions and exposure trips under the guidance of livelihood and responsible tourism experts, who mentor the fellows in creating action plans for possible 'Responsible Tourism' destinations.

This is part of Royal Enfield's CSR initiative, aimed at building resilience in communities and fostering sustainable change, particularly in the Himalayan region.

- Samir Bordoloi, founder, Farm Learning Centre and Food Forest

Shusaye Yobin, 29, is an RT fellow from Arunachal Pradesh's Changlang district, who trained under Bordoloi and became a certified Green Commando. ""The fellowship and this programme completely changed my thought process. I didn't know that something like responsible tourism existed, how to balance nature and tourism,"" she says.

After completing school, Yobin, who is from Hazolo, a village close to the Indo-Myanmar border, decided to become a trekking guide with her uncle's help. A middle child with an older and a younger brother, her family sent her younger brother, but not her, to college.

Yobin is from the Lisu community, a minority tribe whose ancestors were mostly hunters. Hazolo is located close to the Namdapha National Park, and today, its residents, the Lisus, are mostly dependent on the forest. They also earn a livelihood out of farming, mostly growing cardamom.

Until a couple of years ago, there was no road link to the nearest town of Miao. The Hazolo residents had to trek for as long as a week to sell their produce or even buy things like soap, oil, and clothes. There was no health centre, no schools there until recently, either.

Yobin applied for the RT fellowship after hearing about it from an acquaintance. That's how she ended up at Bordoloi's food forest. ""Initially, he sent us into the forest with seed bombs. We never gave importance to mulberry, but then Samir sir gave us cuttings and told us we could plant it wherever we wanted. Three months later, we revisited those spots, and the cuttings had grown into full flowering plants. It was incredible,"" she says.

She adds that the fellowship helped her realise the importance of uplifting her community. ""We at Hazolo have been farming for years, but we always dreamt of studying and becoming doctors. We didn't give value to what we already know, and that is farming. We can show people our culture, our way of life, we make them taste our food, invite them to stay in our homes. It has exposed me to so many new ideas.""

Back at Hazolo, Yobin has already begun involving members of her community, friends and family in sustainable practices. ""We have discussed employing some of the techniques taught to me by Samir sir. We have started waste management. Some people are sceptical, but most are excited and eager to know more,"" she says.

Bidisha Dey, executive director of the Eicher Group Foundation, Royal Enfield's CSR arm, says the fellowship is not just about giving young people a set of skills, but also giving them inspirational values. ""It is not an academic programme, it is hands-on training with those who do this for a living,"" she says.

The model makes sure that these programmes are resilient and can have a life of their own. ""We want to keep community at the heart of everything we do and be a catalyst and ally.""

We didn't give value to what we already know, and that is farming. We can show people our culture, our way of life, we make them taste our food, invite them to stay in our homes.

One of the biggest responsibilities Bordoloi entrusts his green commandos with is to visit schools in their area and pass on some of what they learn to the students.

Bordoloi himself spends a lot of time interacting with school students in various villages of the Northeast and acquainting them with farming. It's why he started the 'Attracting Students to Agripreneurship' (ASAP) programme.

He looks at them as an extension of the community. As part of the programme, he shows students of grades four and five how to farm. ""Earlier, in their midday meals, they would get just rice, plain dal, and maybe potato if they were lucky. Now they grow herbs on their own, which are added to the dal to make it more nutritious. Their mothers call and say the children take delight in what they eat because they grew it themselves.""

School dropouts, or 'outliers' as Bordoloi prefers to call them, have trained under him and gone on to pass out from the National Institute of Open Schooling, to ultimately become educated farmers.

Today, the Food Forest attracts not just people from across the country, but various parts of the world including Germany and the Netherlands. Some come just to hear the sounds of the forest, the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds, some come to escape the hustle and bustle of the cities and experience village life, and others to learn farming techniques.

As the sun sets over the forest, Bordoloi points to a dense pocket of tea bushes. This was where he had his first encounter with a leopard a couple of years ago.

""I was holding a meeting and had stepped out to take a call. And there it was,"" he says, motioning toward a spot about 50 metres away. ""I didn't move, we locked eyes. It was quite a sight! A few moments later, it just jumped over the fence and quietly made its way back into the forest.""

While such an incident triggers fear in anyone, for Bordoloi, it was a good sign. A sign that his painstaking efforts were working -- the food chain had been resurrected, the forest was feeding everyone. The leopard saw him not as a threat, but as a part of the forest.",theprint.in,news,ThePrint,,0.2627450980392156,448944847,1,https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-76.jpg,

However, subtle changes are happening and there are four visible indicators: rising temperatures, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, receding glaciers, and the combined impact of glacial outbursts due to sudden bursts of rainfall leading to flooding threat,"" Lotus said.

Ladakh is a rain shadow area but the region received 27 mm rain in 24 hours during July 2023. While this amount might be minuscule for major cities in the plains, the average monthly rainfall for July is 15 mm, and the average annual rainfall for this region is 100mm, IMD data shows.

Lotus explained that as glaciers recede, they not only reduce the water supply essential for survival but also lead to the formation of more glacial lakes. These lakes, when they suddenly burst, can cause devastating glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). ""Such floods pose a significant risk to the mountainous region of Ladakh. The formation and expansion of these glacial lakes serve as ticking time bombs. Given Ladakh's topography and its reliance on glacial waters, the potential for disaster is magnified,"" he said.

The Ladakh administration has developed an Emergency Operation Centre for disaster mitigation response in such cases.

Another specific indicator has been a more recent one. ""In preceding years, we have never noticed a winter where snowfall did not commence from November or December. However, this winter, we did not get any snowfall till January 28, and suddenly we had very heavy to extremely heavy days of snowfall right through February and continued up till March. The heaviest phase was around February 19-20,"" said Lotus.

Meanwhile, the average temperature range for March and April has also shown fluctuations. ""There has been a 0.5-1 degree Celsius rise in average temperatures for both months based on present assessments. However, a trend can only be understood by observing this for a much longer period,"" he said.

IMD's early warning system (EWS) at the Meteorological Centre at Leh collates data from automatic weather stations present in Drass, Zanskar, Kargil and Nubra Valley. ""Owing to timely information sharing and accuracy of forecasts, no untoward incidents have happened this year. However, with increased urbanisation there is a need for a more robust policy approach towards adaptation and resilience,"" said Lotus.

Wangchuk's hunger strike aims to draw focus to these environmental challenges.

""Ladakh's delicate future hangs in the balance. Our Prime Minister carved out the vision for a carbon-neutral region. It's a call to action for all of us, especially tourists, to rethink our footprint. Opting for diesel taxis to traverse high passes is a choice that weighs heavily on our fragile ecosystem. The defence forces, out of necessity, may rely on diesel due to operational demands, a reality we must accept. However, tourism, rooted in leisure, must tread a different path. This isn't about curbing exploration but about guiding it towards sustainability. Let's distinguish between necessity and leisure, and embrace shared public transport or electric vehicles across the passes,"" said Wangchuk.

""Mining and hotel chains eyeing our pristine lands. Our desert ecology, so fragile that locals thrive on just 5 litres of water daily, unlike the 150 litres used in metropolitan cities, cannot withstand the influx of tourists and new residents consuming water at such rates. The introduction of such large numbers threatens to deplete resources, leaving both locals and visitors bereft, and will turn our homeland barren,"" he said.

Studies and observations by professors from Kashmir University provide evidence of the rapid receding of glaciers in the region. These glaciers, often referred to as the ""Third Pole,"" are crucial water reserves for millions in Asia.

""In recent years, we've observed an unsettling trend: glaciers are receding at an enhanced pace, fueled by the increasing temperatures and heat waves across South Asia,"" said Professor Shakil Ahmad Ramshoo, expert glaciologist and earth scientist, the University of Kashmir. ""This phenomenon is an indicator of the escalating crisis, mirroring the need for climate action.""

Ramshoo explained that each year, the glaciers lose about one metre in thickness, a measure termed as 'one-metre water equivalent.' This concept helps quantify the water produced by melting glaciers. ""Imagine melting ice to fill a cube with sides of one metre each; the volume of water from this melted ice equates to one cubic metre,"" he said.

Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh regions have a vast expanse of about 18,000 glaciers, among which some are notably large, such as the Siachen Glacier, stretching approximately 65 kilometres in length. These glaciers, significant in volume and some reaching depths between 500 to 600 metres, serve as vital freshwater reservoirs.

The other impact to these glaciers is black carbon, fine particulate matter formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. In the Drass region of Ladakh, research by the University of Kashmir indicates a notable acceleration in glacier melt due to rising temperatures and the deposition of black carbon. ""This particulate matter, arising from incomplete combustion, significantly increases glacier heat absorption, speeding up their melting. We studied this across 17 glaciers in the Drass area and found that glaciers which are close to the highway were melting faster,"" said Prof Ramshoo.

And the downstream impact

The accelerated melting and receding glaciers signals catastrophic impact for downstream regions reliant on these water sources. The implications of these environmental changes extend far beyond Ladakh with states like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and even the National Capital Region that depend significantly on rivers originating in the Himalayas.

Dr Anjal Prakash, IPCC author and research director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business said, ""Global warming is fundamentally altering river ecologies, significantly reducing the base flow from Himalayan glaciers. This retreat leads to drier rivers, a shift we're already witnessing. Moreover, monsoon patterns are drastically changing, extending the growing season for certain crops -- a short-term advantage overshadowed by long-term agricultural challenges. Additionally, the risk of GLOFs in the eastern Himalayas, intensified by seismic activities, poses a significant threat, underscoring the need for immediate action in these vulnerable regions.""

Disruption of the seasonal flow patterns of these rivers impact agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and water availability. ""The potential for decreased water supply in the dry season, coupled with increased flooding during the monsoons, poses significant risks to food security, livelihoods, and infrastructure for states in north India as well as the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"" said Prakash.

Glacier melt extends beyond mere water level changes, influencing water security and management across borders. ""As these glaciers diminish, the intricate balance of water sharing under treaties like the Indus Water Treaty faces new challenges, underscoring the necessity for climate-adaptive governance. The Indus Water Treaty, however, does not factor in climate change anywhere in its text,"" said Ramshoo.",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,-0.1843137254901961,448944629,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/23/1600x900/FILE-PHOTO--India-s-Border-Security-Force--BSF--so_1691990725422_1711219791191.jpg,

OncoRes' team of 40 have been recruited from across WA's mining, medical, rail and defence industries, and is preparing for another capital raise as it eyes entry into the US market after being granted FDA Breakthrough Device Designation.

OncoRes isn't the only medical technology company now emerging from WA, with the state now home to a burgeoning medical research sector which Premier Roger Cook says is integral to the long-term diversification away from mining.

""WA is already a world leader in autonomous and robotic technology used by our mining sector, we want to transfer those advantages into health and medical research,"" Mr Cook told The Australian Financial Review.

""There is some fantastic work being done in this field, and I'm proud that local companies like OncoRes Medical are beginning to get the recognition they deserve.""

The WA government is using about $250 million sourced from mining royalties to fund local medical research. The premier is banking on the sector ""paying dividends"" for the state long term.

The company is manufacturing a machine that uses quantitative microelastography, a new imaging technology that maps tissue stiffness at a microscale to detect breast cancer.

Dr Giles said most surgeons are currently forced to rely on their touch to differentiate healthy breast tissue from the cancer, resulting in 20 per cent of women, on average, having cancer left in their body and required to return for more surgery.

In the United States, $US20 billion is spent on breast cancer treatment each year, with instances of overlooked cancer and subsequent return surgeries costing roughly $US700m.

Dr Giles says the probe gives surgeons a ""digital superpower or touch"" to detect cancer that would otherwise be missed.

More than $16 million OncoRes has raised has come from the Commonwealth and WA government, which Dr Giles said had allowed the company to stay WA-based in its formative years working to convince local family offices and investors to look beyond the state's resources sector.

""Investors in WA are certainly far more comfortable with being able to make quite risky investments on mining,"" Dr Giles said.

""What we need to be able to do is educate, I would love to see a future where the investors had as much comfort investing in healthcare innovation as they currently do in mining and taking the risks, because there are similar risks.""",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.02745098039215677,448944618,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7921%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_130%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/13a11dab6f03ce71a739bfa3ad937521308819af,

The sunrise over Zabarmari village was beautiful in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, but it offered no comfort to Fatima Sani, a 22-year-old woman in labour.

Her baby was coming, but the nearest health centre - her only hope - was closed.

Fatima had done everything right. She attended prenatal care and knew when her baby was due. Sadly, she never expected to travel 20 kilometres for delivery, passing three closed health centres along the way.

Tragically, after a long struggle, Fatima lost what would have been her firstborn at Maryam Abacha Women and Children's Hospital in Muna, a community along Dikwa Road, Maiduguri.

While relatives mourned and cried, Fatima's sister-in-law, Aisha Mustapha, a 28-year-old resident of Zabarmari, through tears, shared the heartbreaking news of their ""journey for a safe delivery ending in a devastating stillbirth"".

Before the child's death Fatima had earlier attended the Dalaram Old Maiduguri Primary Healthcare Centre- 15 kilometres away from her community. As of 2p.m the PHC had only community healthcare workers on duty who couldn't handle the childbirth.

Desperate for help, Fatima had to travel another six kilometres, even as she had provided all the items requested by the PHC.

""They started basic care and gave her an IV drip we bought,"" Aisha explained. ""But then, their shift ended--they don't work at night. We had to go somewhere else. They recommended Maryam Abacha Hospital"".

This reporter's visit to Zabarmari PHC confirmed what residents feared: it's not there when people need it. The PHC, meant to serve over 15,000 people, was deserted by 1 p.m., with only security officials at the gate. Signs outside the health facility advertise childbirth services, HIV care, and more - but it's all useless as all the doors are closed.

Similarly, the Shuwari community boasts a well-built primary healthcare (PHC) centre, but operation hours remain a critical concern. Operating under the Jere LGA PHCs and managed by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), the facility serves residents for less than 10 hours daily.

Babagana Mustapha, a 28-year-old community health worker at the PHC, said: ""Nighttime emergencies are impossible to handle, and we urge the government to address this limitation.""

Also, in Muna IDP Camp PHC, limited operating hours (8 a.m. - 3 p.m.) further complicate matters. According to 28-year-old Falmata Usman, even for childbirth, you might need to buy items, and sometimes they refer you to the Lake Chad hospital. ""People go where they can find solutions,"" said Falmata.

Hundreds of internally displaced people (IDPs) call the Muna camp home, with over 2,000 relying on its sole health facility. While this reporter found the clinic clean and well-ventilated, two non-functional motorcycle ambulances outside painted a contrasting picture.

Laudable infrastructure, limited services

Nigeria has clear guidelines for its Primary Healthcare (PHC) centres. These guidelines outline staffing, equipment, medicine, and even operating hours needed to bring essential care to communities. PHCs offer more access to qualified professionals, making healthcare available to more people.

According to the approved budgets of the Borno State Government, the state had invested over N7 billion in its Primary Healthcare (PHC) programme from 2020 to 2023, with significant allocation towards infrastructure and additional midwife recruitment in 2021.

In May 2023, Leadership reported that Borno State won a $1.2 million award for 'PHC leadership'. The award, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Aliko Dangote Foundation, aims to strengthen the state's healthcare sector.

Despite the injection of funds in Borno State's Primary Healthcare (PHC) system, access to essential drugs and services remains a significant concern in some communities.

This reporter visited 10 PHCs in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council and Jere Local Government Area, including Auno, Dalaram, Zabarmari, 707, Wulari, Nana Kashim Premier, Mairi, Shuwari, Muna, 202, and Yerwa.

Sadly, some still fall short of Nigeria's Minimum Standard for Primary Healthcare despite investments in infrastructure.

The Zabarmari PHC tragically illustrates this failure.

It wasn't just Fatima who suffered from delays, unprofessionalism, lack of essential drugs, and a critical shortage of doctors. Such preventable tragedies remain far too familiar. The World Health Organization (WHO) directly links these problems to needless maternal and newborn deaths.

""This clinic is one of the oldest around,"" says 30-year-old Zabarmari resident, Babagana Mustapha. ""It should have been upgraded with better staff by now. I only take my kids there for headaches, and only in the morning. For anything serious, I go all the way into town,"" Mr Babagana explained.

The Zabarmari PHC needs a basic ambulance tricycle for faster transport to better hospitals. Without doctors, a quicker transfer could still make a difference. This raises serious concerns about access to emergency care.

Auno, a small community outside Maiduguri, in Jere LGA, also shares a heartbreaking reality: its PHC is under-equipped.

""We lack doctors and necessities like water,"" admits Zanna Sheriff, head of the Auno PHC. ""I often spend my money on water for deliveries and other essential needs"".

Similarly, in Auno, Lawan Goni, a 60-year-old resident, was forced to take his sick son to a distant town hospital for malaria treatment. ""I don't regret the trip,"" says Goni. He knew his son wouldn't receive the care he needed at the local PHC.

Maryam Idris, a 30-year-old resident near the Auno Health Centre, feels frustrated. Despite the centre's convenient location, she's stopped visiting due to what she sees as inadequate drug supplies.

""They hardly ever give out medication,"" she explains. ""They might give you a prescription for a week's worth of drugs but then tell you to buy them yourself."" This has been a major problem, especially when her two-year-old daughter was sick. The centre could only offer paracetamol, leaving her questioning if they didn't have more resources.

Lack of essential drugs

It's important to understand that primary health centres do have limitations. However, they are meant to give special attention to those most in need - pregnant women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and those in poverty.

Nana Kashim PHC manager, Yakawu Mustapha, acknowledges the centre tries to do this, even with limited resources.

Mr Mustapha said they prioritise the most vulnerable members of society, providing them with free services. However, she explained: ""The PHC is meant to serve the immediate community as other PHCs are serving other communities."" This means they turn away other community members in need.

PHCs are meant to offer almost free healthcare for the most vulnerable, but the reality is often different. Some residents still end up paying for essential drugs or services they can't afford.

Aisha faced this challenge at Dalaram PHC.

She said they lack basic birthing supplies like gloves and lotion - things every delivery needs. ""They charge here, and we had no money,"" she said. Thankfully, older women helped her negotiate fees, and she paid N2,500 for the supplies for an unsuccessful childbirth.

Even the Maryam Abacha Women and Children Hospital, managed by the Borno State Health Management Board and meant for specialised care, wasn't free. ""They asked where we came from,"" Aisha recalled the desperation. She even showed Fatima's prenatal records to get a bed. Still, Aisha paid for essentials like gloves and syringes.

""Some I had to buy outside"", she added. A N2,000 discharge fee was paid for Fatima, but the delivery ward worker needed help to provide a receipt, leaving them confused.

According to a report by Dailytrust, two years earlier, the government had reaffirmed its commitment to healthcare reform, proudly announcing new staff quarters, recruitment drives, and additional maternal supplies for free care at the Maryam Abacha hospital. Yet, reality presented a stark contrast.

Halima Isah, 28, lives in the 202 Housing Estate and sometimes gets prescriptions to buy drugs outside the PHC. However, she's never charged fees for services at this facility.

This reporter observed women at the 202 PHC who travelled up to 10 kilometres to get there. Rukayya Sani, 27, from Wadiya, said she prefers this location because it's free, unlike the PHC in her community, where she pays for certain things. Safiya Goni, 30, from Custom Area, also confirms paying for some services in the PHC located in her community.

Meanwhile, Husseina Liman from Mairi was referred to the 202 PHC and told that ""everything was given free.""

However, Ummi Mustapha, a nurse at 202 PHC, said: ""Drugs and all essential services in this facility are free of charge; not even client cards are being sold."" She's saddened to hear that other PHCs charge for services.

Ms Mustapha believes that other PHCs charging for items like syringes and gloves are why people from nearby communities come to the 202 PHC instead. She said all allocations of drugs and other medical items are equally distributed across PHCs in Borno State. ""So there should be no reason for charges.""

A midwife assistant at the Shuwari PHC, Aishatu Abba, said the centre doesn't have necessary items to give the women after childbirth. She said the PHC also has no water.

""We can't give the patients standard health care because we don't have the essentials in the PHC,"" Mrs Abba said.

Similarly, when in February this reporter visited the Muna IDP camp PHC, which was renovated and maintained by the State Primary Health Care Development Agency with UNICEF support, residents complained of a week-long absence of medications.

""Doctors prescribe medications for patients to purchase, although previously drugs were provided here,"" said Abbah Modu, a 40-year-old Muna resident and PHC cleaner.

The Muna IDP facility has two small buildings, a delivery room, a consulting area, and a pharmacy that attend to hundreds of IDPs who are yet to be resettled by the government. Residents like Falmata shared their frustration.

""Despite a severe fever, sometimes all I get is paracetamol,"" she said. ""Most of us head to the Lake Chad hospital instead. They often prescribe drugs we must buy ourselves"".

Seeking answers

This reporter wrote to the Borno State Primary Health Development Agency (SPHDA) for an official reaction to the report.

After a follow-up, the reporter was directed to the agency's Director of Planning, Research and Statistics. However, the director said he would only speak with clearance from the Borno State Ministry of Health. This reporter also submitted a proposal to the Ministry's ethics committee but was yet to receive a response as of the time of filing this report.

Similarly, efforts to interview the officials in Jere LGA in charge of PHCs yielded no results as a letter seeking clarifications and possible interviews was not replied to.

A staffer of the LGA, who asked to be anonymous, said the director might be available after a scheduled tour with the new Jere LGA chairperson.

However, Shettima Abdulazeez, Director of PHCs in MMC LGA, did address staffing issues.

He admits healthcare worker shortages are a global problem, including in Maiduguri. However, he insists that MMC facilities are working and are accessible for the public.

Mr Abdulazeez emphasised that facility's workers are well-trained and that they refer complex cases and follow up with patients.

""We want people to know they can freely access these facilities. We have about 26 functional PHCs in MMC,"" the official said.",allafrica.com,news,allAfrica,,-0.2549019607843137,448944386,1,https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,

Gary Gensler, the big cheese at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is not playing games when it comes to the wild west of the crypto industry. It's like he walked into a saloon, guns blazing, taking aim at the sneaky varmints trying to dodge the law. At a recent discussion at Columbia Law School, Gensler shared that he is all for dragging the crypto cowboys into the sunshine, because, in his book, sunlight zaps germs better than anything.

It seems some crypto players think they're slick, slipping through the cracks of SEC's rules like they're greased up. But Gensler's having none of it. He's out to slap the mandatory disclosure label on them, making sure everyone knows what's what. Without it, it's like a free-for-all, where nobody knows who's holding aces and who's bluffing. Gensler reckons a bit of sunlight might just clean up the town.

Gensler's Regulatory Showdown

Now, let's get this straight. Gensler's not some lone ranger. He's got his posse - the SEC - and they've been busy rounding up the usual suspects. From Kraken to Binance, and Ripple to Coinbase, nobody's riding off into the sunset. The SEC wants to lay down the law, make things clear so innovation can thrive without turning into a free-for-all.

But here's the problem. While Gensler's gang is tightening the noose, they're also eyeing Ethereum, thinking it might just be the next wanted poster. They've been green-lighting some crypto-tied goodies for the trading folk, like those shiny new Bitcoin and Ethereum future-based toys and even the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Talk about mixed signals.

Yet, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, along come Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, waving a big red flag about crypto ETFs. They reckon it's like inviting sharks to a pool party. According to them, letting more crypto ETFs through the door is like asking for trouble, with markets thinner than a cowboy's patience and ripe for all sorts of shenanigans.

A Tug of War in the Wild West

These senators are not whispering sweet nothings. They're shouting from the rooftops that Bitcoin, while it's got its own can of worms, is at least under the spotlight. But other cryptocurrencies? They're like the murky back alleys of Dodge City. The senators are laying it on thick, asking Gensler to keep a tighter leash on those Bitcoin ETF cowboys, making sure they're not leading the herd off a cliff.

And oh boy, does it seem like Gensler's caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, there's the success of the Bitcoin ETFs making waves, and on the other, there's the political bigwigs breathing down his neck. The chatter around town is that the chances of a spot Ether ETF getting the nod are slim, thanks to this whole kerfuffle.

It's like watching a standoff at high noon. Gensler and the SEC are in the middle, with crypto enthusiasts on one side and cautious politicians on the other. The crypto industry's looking for a hero, but it's a fine line between lawman and outlaw in this digital frontier.

So, there you have it. Gensler's on a mission to clean up the crypto industry, armed with disclosures and regulations.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Jai Hamid,0.2549019607843137,448944287,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DALL·E-2024-03-23-01.53.24-Create-a-symbolic-and-slightly-satirical-image-that-represents-the-U.S.-Securities-and-Exchange-Commissions-SEC-intention-to-_disinfect_-the-crypto.webp,

Environmental, social and governance, the three pillars of ESG has become keystone for businesses, steering the complications of the 21st century. This framework, an overall holistic approach, exceeds mere philanthropy. It serves as a strategic lens to evaluate a company's assurance to sustainability and responsible practices. Let's investigate the three pillars of ESG, deep down, help explore the opportunities and inconveniences, companies face in executing them.

To assess a company's environmental impact, the key considerations include:

Climate Change: Do they have a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and switch to renewable energy sources?

Resource Management: How efficiently do they use resources like water and energy? Do they have strategies for conservation and minimizing waste?

Pollution Control: What measures are in place to control air, water, and land pollution?

Social responsibility, focuses on the company's interactions with its employees, stakeholders, and the wider community. It evaluates:

· Workplace Practices: Are employees offered fair wages, safe work environments, and chances for professional growth?

· Diversity and Inclusion: Does the company actively promote a diverse and inclusive workforce, ensuring equal opportunities for all?

· Ethical Sourcing: Does the company maintain ethical labour practices throughout its supply chain, preventing exploitation and discrimination?

· Community Impact: Does the company contribute positively to its surrounding communities? Does it invest in social initiatives and support local development efforts?

Governance delves into a company's internal structure and processes. The key aspects include:

· Board Structure: Does the board have a diverse composition and provide independent oversight?

· Executive Pay: Are executive compensation packages fair and tied to company performance?

· Transparency: Does the company disclose ESG metrics and performance clearly? Are stakeholders kept informed?

· Risk Management: Does the company have strong risk management practices to identify and address potential environmental, social, and governance issues?

· Ethical Conduct: Does the company operate with integrity, upholding ethical codes of conduct and avoiding bribery or corruption?

The companies that prioritise ESG can enjoy several benefits like reduced risk, Enhanced Reputation and improved financial performance. Strong ESG practices can mitigate environmental risks like climate change regulations, resource scarcity, and pollution control costs. Similarly, good social practices can improve employee retention, reduce legal issues, and enhance brand reputation. Consumers and investors are gradually prioritizing companies with strong ESG values. A positive ESG profile can attract and preserve talent, improve brand image, and boost customer loyalty.

Despite the advantages, implementing strong ESG practices isn't without its challenges. There's no single standardized way to measure ESG performance. ESG considerations need to be integrated throughout a company's operations, not just a separate department. This requires buy-in from leadership, clear communication, and a cultural shift across the organization. Investing in ESG initiatives often requires upfront costs with long-term returns. Managing the ESG practices of a complex supply chain can be challenging. Companies need robust due diligence processes to ensure ethical sourcing and labour practices throughout the entire chain.

As regulations and investor scrutiny grow, companies will need to find innovative ways to effectively integrate ESG into their strategies. Standardising ESG metrics and reporting will be crucial for transparency and comparability.

Collaborative efforts between governments, businesses, and NGOs can create a robust framework for ESG implementation. Eventually, strong ESG practices can lead to a more sustainable future for businesses, the environment, and society at large.",thestatesman.com,news,The Statesman,,0.192156862745098,448943839,1,https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7002.jpeg,eng-9418510

South City got the responsibility to maintain seven of the canals. Three of these are box culverts (Arambagh-Segunbagicha, Panthapath and Dholai Khal). Dhaka North City got responsibility of maintaining 29 canals.

In the two years after taking over from Dhaka WASA, Dhaka South City Corporation continuously cleared the canals or garbage and silt. This yielded good results in 2021 and 2022. In those two years, there was no acute waterlogging during the rains in Dhaka South City Corporation area.

However, since the approval of the 'Canal reclamation, restoration and beautification project' in October 2022, the city corporation's waste management department has not cleared the garbage from the canals. The impact of this was felt last year. In August and September last year, a few heavy rainfalls sent many areas of Dhaka South City Corporation under water for long spans of time.

This Tk 8.98 billion (Tk 898 crore) project is supposed to be completed in June 2027. One and a half years have already passed, but work on the project has not started properly. Project director and Dhaka South City Corporation superintending engineer Khairul Baker told Prothom Alo that the contractors have been given the work order to remove the garbage from the canals. The work has even begun in some places. He said, it is difficult to delineate the canal boundaries and that it why it is taking time to start the work in full swing.

Urban planners, however, say that it is not as if Dhaka South City will be free of waterlogging once this project is implemented. The reason behind this, they say, is there are many stages of the rainwater going from the drains to the canals and on to the rivers. The rainwater first goes through the catch pit (the grill that covers the drain) into the sewerage drain below. The drain opening also gets blocked up with polythene, chips packets, plastic bottles and all sorts of waste as well as sand. These drains need to be cleaned regularly. It is questionable as to how efficiently the city corporation carries out this task.",en.prothomalo.com,news,Prothomalo,Mohammed Mostafa,0.06666666666666665,448943719,1,https://images.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-english%2F2024-03%2F9716dca0-ce8d-4bbd-b08f-afb19cb58563%2Fcanal.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&overlay=&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width_pct=1,

The digital asset frontier is vast, with Bitcoin and Ethereum claiming the lion's share of the market and attention. However, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock's Head of Digital Assets, recently shed light on the company's strategic focus within this burgeoning sector. According to Mitchnick, while the crypto community's appetite for a diverse array of products is voracious, BlackRock's gaze remains fixated primarily on Bitcoin, with a modest nod towards Ethereum, and barely a glance at the rest.

BlackRock's foray into the cryptocurrency realm isn't a spur-of-the-moment adventure. It's a calculated journey that began as far back as 2016. This was a period when the digital currency space was still in its infancy, with the infrastructure, regulatory framework, and client interest all in nascent stages. Mitchnick's narrative highlights a dynamic strategy, evolving in tandem with the crypto ecosystem's growth over the years. This evolution mirrors the asset manager's approach to becoming a stalwart in the space, balancing innovation with caution.

The dialogue around cryptocurrency at BlackRock isn't confined to mere speculation. It's a comprehensive discourse that spans the spectrum of client sophistication. From seasoned investors to novices, the conversations traverse the basics of blockchain technology to intricate market dynamics and portfolio considerations. This educational endeavor by BlackRock signifies a broader commitment to demystifying the crypto space for its clientele, ensuring they're well-informed to make prudent investment decisions.

The pivot towards Bitcoin, particularly through the lens of BlackRock's IBIT offering, underscores a significant trend. Investors, both new and those reevaluating their crypto holdings, are increasingly gravitating towards Bitcoin. This shift isn't just about diversification. It's a quest for understanding the inherent risks and potential rewards, aiming to integrate these digital assets into a broader, well-rounded portfolio. The discourse isn't solely fixated on Bitcoin, though. Ethereum gets its share of the spotlight, albeit to a lesser extent, reflecting a cautious yet open-minded approach to portfolio expansion within the crypto domain.

As the conversation around cryptocurrency matures, the next big milestones for Bitcoin and its digital counterparts remain a topic of fervent speculation. Mitchnick, however, steers away from pinpointing a singular event or development as the pivotal moment for the industry. Instead, he suggests a gradual, yet inevitable, progression fueled by increasing institutional comfort and sophistication, alongside a deepening collective understanding of the asset class.

The scene at the bustling Bitcoin Investor Day in New York, as recounted by Mitchnick, is just a glimpse into the broader journey BlackRock is embarking on within the crypto industry. Amidst a packed schedule and the anticipation of further insights on stage, the firm's strategy appears both clear and calculated. Focus on Bitcoin, eye Ethereum, and proceed with caution as the crypto universe expands.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.2627450980392156,448943605,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9418345

It's like he walked into a saloon, guns blazing, taking aim at the sneaky varmints trying to dodge the law. At a recent discussion at Columbia Law School, Gensler shared that he is all for dragging the crypto cowboys into the sunshine, because, in his book, sunlight zaps germs better than anything.

It seems some crypto players think they're slick, slipping through the cracks of SEC's rules like they're greased up. But Gensler's having none of it. He's out to slap the mandatory disclosure label on them, making sure everyone knows what's what. Without it, it's like a free-for-all, where nobody knows who's holding aces and who's bluffing. Gensler reckons a bit of sunlight might just clean up the town.

Now, let's get this straight. Gensler's not some lone ranger. He's got his posse - the SEC - and they've been busy rounding up the usual suspects. From Kraken to Binance, and Ripple to Coinbase, nobody's riding off into the sunset. The SEC wants to lay down the law, make things clear so innovation can thrive without turning into a free-for-all.

But here's the problem. While Gensler's gang is tightening the noose, they're also eyeing Ethereum, thinking it might just be the next wanted poster. They've been green-lighting some crypto-tied goodies for the trading folk, like those shiny new Bitcoin and Ethereum future-based toys and even the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Talk about mixed signals.

Yet, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, along come Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, waving a big red flag about crypto ETFs. They reckon it's like inviting sharks to a pool party. According to them, letting more crypto ETFs through the door is like asking for trouble, with markets thinner than a cowboy's patience and ripe for all sorts of shenanigans.

These senators are not whispering sweet nothings. They're shouting from the rooftops that Bitcoin, while it's got its own can of worms, is at least under the spotlight. But other cryptocurrencies? They're like the murky back alleys of Dodge City. The senators are laying it on thick, asking Gensler to keep a tighter leash on those Bitcoin ETF cowboys, making sure they're not leading the herd off a cliff.

And oh boy, does it seem like Gensler's caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, there's the success of the Bitcoin ETFs making waves, and on the other, there's the political bigwigs breathing down his neck. The chatter around town is that the chances of a spot Ether ETF getting the nod are slim, thanks to this whole kerfuffle.

It's like watching a standoff at high noon. Gensler and the SEC are in the middle, with crypto enthusiasts on one side and cautious politicians on the other. The crypto industry's looking for a hero, but it's a fine line between lawman and outlaw in this digital frontier.

So, there you have it. Gensler's on a mission to clean up the crypto industry, armed with disclosures and regulations.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.3568627450980393,448943566,18,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Oljas Bektenov has held a meeting with the Executive Vice President of Shell, Peter Costello, to discuss the status of their collaborative projects in the oil and gas industry, Trend reports.

Therefore, maintaining oil and condensate output at a level of at least 11 million tons annually is the top objective, according to the Karachaganak expansion project. In order to do this, the involved parties will guarantee the prompt commissioning of extra compressors for raw gas reinjection.

Concurrently, the question of building a 4 billion cubic meter per year gas processing plant in Karachaganak at the expense of the shareholders is being discussed in order to guarantee the project's complete operation.

Furthermore, particular focus was placed on the Kashagan field's consistent operation. Production of gas reached 11.86 billion m3 and oil 18.77 million tons in the last year. 5.83 billion m3 of gas were reinjected into the reservoir. The question of constructing a gas processing facility in Kashagan is in the development stage in order to fully exploit the field.

Oljas Bektenov emphasized the importance of incorporating more Kazakh content into projects, especially by relocating production facilities.

""Today, the proportion of local content in project operators' labor is adequate; nevertheless, the proportion of local content in products purchases is still quite low. This necessitates more communication with regional producers who are interested in making goods,"" he stated.

The attendees reaffirmed their commitment to advancing long-term cooperation after the conference.

President Ramaphosa noted that the event is an important part of South Africa's infrastructure development endeavours and emphasised that additional infrastructure investment of R1.6 trillion (US$84 billion) from the public sector and a further R3.2 trillion (US$168 billion) from the private sector will be required to achieve infrastructure targets by 2030.

""The government is currently working on projects aimed at developing sustainable infrastructure, boosting business confidence and incentivising investment,"" and emphasised that ""South Africa is positioning itself as a leader in the production of green hydrogen in pursuit of a sustainable future based on innovation.""

The Green Hydrogen Programme, consisting of 14 projects, is an important part of the country's equitable transition. Major water infrastructure projects are under construction in several parts of the country, expanding the capacity of dams and water infrastructure. Infrastructure South Africa is refocusing project preparation to stimulate growth and develop export sectors, manufacturing and the green economy.

""The focus is on projects that contribute to job creation both during construction and operation. Infrastructure South Africa is also preparing projects in a way that promotes inclusivity by increasing local participation. These projects are expected to create over 400,000 jobs during construction and operation.""

The Sustainable Infrastructure Symposium has been an important part of the growth of infrastructure investment in the country since it was first held in 2020.

According to organisers, the event was created to facilitate the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP) and to ensure access to greater and economical sources of sustainable funding, reported by Pretoria News, a partner of TV BRICS.

RALEIGH, N.C. -- Rickea Jackson scored 26 points and Tennessee rolled past Green Bay 92-63 in the first round of the women's NCAA Tournament Saturday.

Sarah Puckett added 14 points, Jewel Spear had 13 and reserve Tess Darby 11 for the sixth-seeded Lady Vols, who are the only team to participate in all 42 women's NCAA Tournaments. It was the first game back in Raleigh, North Carolina for Tennessee coach Kellie Harper, who coached North Carolina State for four seasons from 2009-13.

""We were just so connected on the defensive end today and helping each other, talking,"" Jackson said. ""We were just doing everything because we knew that they're a great efficient offensive team, and in order to beat them we would have to do that.""

The task will be tougher Monday. Harper and Tennessee (20-12) will face third-seeded North Carolina State (28-6) for a spot in the Sweet 16 in Portland, Oregon. The Wolfpack beat Chattanooga 64-45 in the second game.

Maddy Schreiber led 11th-seeded Green Bay (27-7) with 13 points, but the Phoenix remained without an NCAA Tournament victory since 2012 by suffering their most-lopsided loss of the season. Veteran coach Kevin Borseth gave a salute to teary-eyed fans as he walked off the court.

Tennessee reached the 20-win mark for the 47th time, including the fourth in Harper's five seasons. The Lady Vols have been seeded lower than sixth only twice.

""For us to be able to get an easy win, that's a big deal,"" Harper said. ""You're watching the NCAA Tournament and you're seeing upsets, and we didn't want to be on that end of it.""

This marked Tennessee's first game since nearly knocking off previously undefeated and No. 1 overall seed South Carolina in the Southeast Conference tournament semifinals March 9.

""They made everything,"" Borseth said. ""They shot really well. They were 70% in the second quarter.""

The impact from Tennessee's interior size advantage was too much for Green Bay. The Lady Vols shot 58.3% from the field, with Jackson going 10-for-14.

""I feel like we just stayed within our offense, and we just know our plays so where the open person would be,"" Jackson said. ""I feel like we capitalized on their mistakes.""

The Phoenix had trouble at times finding open space for shots.

""They're big girls,"" Scheiber said. ""They're tough girls, so I think it was a little bit challenging when we got out there, but we played with them for a while.""

Tennessee held a 44-28 halftime lead, holding the Phoenix without a point for the last 5:53 of the half while scoring the final 11 points. The Vols scored 18 points in the first five minutes of the third quarter, stretching their lead to 62-37.

The teams combined to make five of the first seven 3-pointers attempted. Green Bay went up 12-6 before the Volunteers built a 38-28 lead, with Spear collecting 11 points in the first 15 minutes.

""They switched up their defense on us, so I think our momentum with how we were first going at it kind of had to switch a little bit,"" Schreiber said.

HOME COOKING

Tennessee center Tamari Key, a redshirt senior, is from the Raleigh suburb of Cary and she played in her home state for the first time in her college career. She scored seven points, her lowest total in an opening-round game in NCAA Tournament play.

""There's so many great stories in women's basketball,"" Harper said. ""I'll be honest with you, bringing Tamari Key here to play in the NCAA Tournament is a great one, too.""

Key and other starters had limited second-half minutes because of the Lady Vols' comfortable margin.

Green Bay's roster was distinctly different. Every player is from Wisconsin or Minnesota.

The Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Oluwole Oke, has lamented the decaying infrastructure at court premises and residential quarters of Nigerian judges.

However, the lawmaker commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi; Speaker of the House, Abbas Tajudeen and the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) on the recent passage of the bill reviewing the salaries and allowances of judicial officers across the country.

Oke, who represents the Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency of Osun State, also lauded members of the House for unanimously voting in support of the bill on the floor of the Green Chamber earlier in the week.

The lawmaker, in a statement yesterday, observed that the decay in the nation's court premises and residential quarters of judges needed to be looked into.

""The more we have better infrastructure, the better the readiness of our judicial officers to dispense services to the society at large.

""The Court of Appeal is struggling with management of off-season elections petitions. Tribunals have 20 cases currently ongoing and the judiciary itself does not have adequate manpower. They can't recruit if they don't have enough resources to pay them. So, we plead with our beloved President to look at this too,"" he stated.

When the bill receives the assent of the President, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, other Justices of the Supreme Court, President of the Court of Appeal and other categories of judicial officers would receive improved monthly salaries as well as regular and irregular allowances. Oke noted that judicial officers would be better placed to deliver services to the Nigerian people when the bill is signed into law.

""The last time the salaries of judicial officers were reviewed was in 2007.""

So, we are glad that Mr. President, the Speaker, the Attorney General has heeded our plea and approved new salaries and allowances for them. With this, the nation can be assured of improved dispensation of justice because the welfare of the judicial workforce cannot be dismissed,"" the statement added.

The lawmaker also called on the President to heed the yearnings of members of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria who have been agitating for better remuneration in the past few years.

He further tasked the judiciary to continue to perform their duties without fear or favour, even as he reminded them not to forget that they remain the representatives of God on earth and the last hope of the common man.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.0117647058823529,448942984,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-20200428-WA0019-640x360.jpg,

Its deficiency can have several adverse effects on skin health, impacting both its appearance and function. Here's an overview of the impact of Vitamin C deficiency on the skin:

Collagen Production: Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a structural protein that provides strength and elasticity to the skin.

Wound Healing: Vitamin C plays a crucial role in wound healing by promoting the production of collagen and facilitating tissue repair.

Antioxidant Protection: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant, helping to neutralise free radicals generated by environmental stressors such as UV radiation, pollution, and toxins.

Hyperpigmentation: Vitamin C plays a role in regulating melanin production, the pigment responsible for skin coloration.

Skin Texture and Tone: Vitamin C deficiency can contribute to uneven skin texture and tone, characterised by roughness, dryness, and a lacklustre complexion.

Blood Vessel Health: Vitamin C plays a role in maintaining the health of blood vessels, including those supplying nutrients and oxygen to the skin.

The good thing about recent weeks around here is that there is a lot more going on than just the main event. That should help get us ready for the pay per view next month so let's get to it.

Opening recap.

Leon Slater vs. Chris Bey vs. Alan Angels vs. Jason Hotch vs. Kevin Knight vs. Jake Something

The winner gets an X-Division Title shot at Rebellion so Mustafa Ali is on commentary. Knight sends Hotch outside for the big flip dive before everyone else goes after Something. The other three go at it inside until Hotch comes in to jump them from behind as we take a break. Back with Hotch and Angels double teaming Knight, much to Ali's happiness. Bey is back in to pick up the pace but Something comes in to take over.

Knight, Hotch and Angels get together to take Something out, leaving Slater to come in with a powerbomb. Bey fights up and grabs a spinning tornado DDT on Something but Slater is back in for the dive. A high flip dive to the floor takes out some people on the floor (Ali takes credit for bringing this version of action to you), leaving Something to powerbomb Knight. Into The Void gives Something the pin on Hotch at 10:03.

Result: Jake Something b. Leon Slater, Chris Bey, Alan Angels, Jason Hotch and Kevin Knight - Into The Void to Hotch (10:03)

Dirty Dango, with company, complains about how people only care about match ratings instead of promos. He has two anchors weighing him down so Oleg Prudius walks off.

AJ Francis says Rich Swann will give his explanation next week. Now go away.

Here is Deaner to say he has had a lot of failures in recent years and those failures are because of him. When he was a kid, he decided he loved wrestling and now he wants to get his passion back. Therefore, every decision he will make will belong to the fans. Cue the Grizzled Young Veterans to say Deaner needs to listen to them because he is nothing. Now jog on! Deaner puts it up to the fans, who think he should stay. The people have spoken and the fight is on, with the Timesplitters (scheduled to fight the Veterans) to clear the ring.

Grizzled Young Veterans vs. Timesplitters

Shelley runs Drake over to start and it's off to Kushida, who gets taken down rather quickly. That doesn't last long so it's back to Shelley, who takes Drake down by the arm. Drake is sent cashing out to the floor and we take a break. Back with Shelley fighting his way out of the corner and taking out Gibson's arm, including what might be seen as a cheap shot.

Gibson goes after Shelley's knee though and they head outside, with the knee being dropped onto the apron. Back in and Shelley reverses into some kind of a leglock, only to have Drake make a save of his own. Shelley fights up and grabs a hiptoss of all things, allowing the tag back to Kushida. House is cleaned but the Veterans cut him off with an assisted Sliced Bread #2. Everything breaks down and Shelley comes back in with the Shell Shock. Kushida grabs the Hoverboard Lock to make Drake tap at 12:15.

Result: Timesplitters b. Grizzled Young Veterans - Hoverboard Lock to Drake (12:15)

We get a sitdown interview with Hammerstone, who talks about how he had a match here on Xplosion several years ago. He was told he wasn't ready, and that gave him a big chip on his shoulder. Then he came back and attacked Josh Alexander, though Hannifan points out that Hammerstone lost. Hammerstone: ""Are you an interviewer or commentary?"" Hammerstone says he showed he was smarter and holds up Alexander's headgear as his trophy. If Alexander wants another shot, he can get beaten up.

Digital Media Title: Crazzy Steve vs. PCO

PCO is challenging and they go to the floor to start with PCO sending him into the apron. Steve sends him into the post though and hammers away back inside. Some more shots just wake PCO up though and he hits a Codebreaker out of the corner. A middle rope legdrop to the back of the head sets up the DeAnimator but cue Kon with a bunch of weapons.

Some of those weapons are thrown inside so PCO goes outside for the brawl. As Steve has the referee, the chairs are set up (the fans prefer tables) but PCO takes too long, allowing Kon to drop him onto the chairs. That's enough for Steve to grab the pin and retain the title at 8:24.

Result: Crazzy Steve b. PCO - Rollup (8:24)

Decay wants their rematch with Spitfire but MK Ultra interrupt. They should get the first title match so a #1 contenders match is set up.

Here is Eric Young for a chat. Young says Frankie Kazarian should watch what he wishes for, because he has Young's attention. The challenge is on for Full Metal Mayhem at Rebellion.

Ashe By Elegance vs. Seleziya Sparx

Sparx talks trash to start but gets punched/kneed in the face for her efforts. We pause for Ashe to have her hand checked on by her handler, setting up a handspring elbow in the corner. Rarefied Air finishes for Ashe at 2:35.

Result: Ashe By Elegance b. Seleziya Sparx - Rarefied Air (2:35)

Post match Ashe stays on Sparx but Xia Brookside runs in for the save.

Here is Nic Nemeth for a chat. He wants the World Title but he respects everyone in that locker room far too much to be handed a title shot. He proved that to Steve Maclin but Moose couldn't wait, which has gotten Nemeth a title shot. Cue the System to interrupt, with Moose saying that if anyone knows Nemeth's career, they know he can't beat the system. And that's it.

Knockouts Title: Tasha Steelz vs. Jordynne Grace

Grace is defending and knocks back a charging Steelz as we take a break less than thirty seconds in. Back with Steelz being dropped again, setting up a spinebuster to give Grace two. The Juggernaut Driver is blocked and Steelz grabs a triangle choke, which is broken up with a powerbomb for two.

The MuscleBuster is countered as well and Steelz hits Sliced Bread #2 for two of her own. Steelz sends her out to the apron so Grace goes up top, where she is kicked in the head. A hurricanrana brings her down but Grace is back with a discus lariat. The Juggernaut Driver is enough to retain the title at 11:15.

Result: Jordynne Grace b. Tasha Steelz - Juggernaut Driver (11:15)

Results

Jake Something b. Leon Slater, Chris Bey, Alan Angels, Jon Skyler and Kevin Knight - Into The Void to Skyler

Government is pursuing multipronged strategy including a steering group on international reporting and assurance standards: spokeswoman

To achieve its climate goals, Hong Kong should close three “loopholes” in green finance by setting volume targets, restricting fossil fuel financing and enacting a specialised anti-greenwashing law, according to Greenpeace.

While the city boasts of being the top green finance hub in Asia, having arranged over one-third of Asia’s green and sustainable bond issuances, it needs to do more to prevent “greenwashing”, said a joint report by the environmental campaigner, along with climate-action group CarbonCare InnoLab.

When engaging in greenwashing, companies are unable to substantiate their claims by meeting commonly adopted measurement, reporting and verification standards on the environmental benefits of green products, including financial instruments. Left unchecked, this creates disincentives for society to take sustainability seriously.

“Hong Kong lacks an overarching green finance strategy for stakeholders to know how much green finance will be available for the city to achieve its climate goals,” Tom Ng Hon-lam, a Greenpeace campaigner said ahead of the report’s publication on Sunday.

“Hong Kong also has no plan to restrict financing for fossil fuel investment, nor any proposal for specialised anti-greenwashing legislation. These loopholes may hinder Hong Kong’s ability to become Asia’s leading green finance hub.”

He cited policies in some Asian regions as examples of where the city can “catch up”, including Shanghai’s target, unveiled a year ago, to achieve 1.5 trillion yuan (US$208 billion) of green transactions covering bonds, insurance, managed funds, trusts and leasing by next year. Similarly, Guangdong province aims to quadruple the scale of green bond issuance next year, compared with the 2020 level.

Relying on voluntary actions by financial intermediaries and borrowers are insufficient to ensure climate-mitigation results, said CarbonCare researcher Kevin Li.

“Many financial institutions have issued targets and financing policies to drive their borrowers and investees’ decarbonisation, but it is very difficult to hold them accountable for the implementation and achievement,” he said. “Only policies and regulations can do that.”

In 2020, the government unveiled a goal for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2021, it published a detailed climate action plan including an interim target to halve carbon emissions by 2035 from the 2005 level, with a budget of HK$240 billion for climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives.

Asked about the need to set green finance plans and targets, a spokeswoman at the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said the government has a multipronged strategy to promote green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong.Transition finance seen as a crucial tool in the fight against climate change

This includes building a green technology ecosystem, innovating in green finance, certifying green attributes, subsidising talent training and enhancing cooperation with regional and international markets.

“[On directing] capital to green projects, the government is leading by example through the issuance of government green bonds … [and] has also pledged to cease using coal for daily electricity generation by 2035,” the spokeswoman said.

Hong Kong has not carried out any high-profile prosecutions or regulatory actions for incidents of greenwashing, even though there is a Trade Descriptions Ordinance that could be used to go after such behaviour, Ng noted.Hong Kong must embrace green finance as opportunity, responsibility: HKMA CEO

In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority has ordered a number of large companies to withdraw advertisements deemed to be misleading on environmental claims. Similarly, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has recently tightened rules requiring that sellers of financial products ensure their sustainability labelling is fair and not misleading.

South Korea is using the legislative process to regulate greenwashing and fine companies judged by the country’s Ministry of Environment to have deceived the public about their green credentials.

To combat greenwashing of financial products in Hong Kong, a cross-agency steering group co-led by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is developing a road map for adopting international sustainability reporting and assurance standards in Hong Kong, an SFC spokesman said. The FSTB and bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing are also members of the group, along with other government departments and regulators.Green finance: surge of climate-transition guidance to promote decarbonisation

By amending its fund manager code of conduct and issuing a circular on ESG (environment, social, governance) funds in 2021, the SFC has already set regulatory expectations on the management and disclosure of climate-related risks and the naming and disclosures of ESG funds, which are in line with international standards, he added.

“All of these tools are backed by the Securities and Futures Ordinance, which empowers the SFC to take appropriate regulatory actions for compliance breaches,” he said.

An HKMA spokeswoman said the cross-agency group expects to publish in the middle of this year the first phase of a green classification framework, which will provide standards for measuring green performance and guide capital allocation.

Last November, HKMA also issued a circular to banks setting out the expected standards with reference to international practices, for classifying investment products they sell as green or sustainable, she added.",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.05098039215686279,448942605,1,,

The online maps indicate that the alarm was raised in the Nikolayev region at 03:05 Moscow time, followed by the Chernovtsy region six minutes later. Earlier, at 02:40, an alarm was sounded in the Khmelnitsky region, and at 01:35 in the Vinnitsa region. The Cherkasy region has been on alert since 01:13.

Prior to this, it was reported that two explosions occurred at the Ukrainian hydroelectric power station, DniproHES. As noted by Vladimir Rogov, the head of the Zaporizhzhia public movement ""We Are Together with Russia,"" the missile strike on the hydroelectric power station deprived Ukraine of a powerful source of energy.

Russian military forces have been targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, shortly after the explosion on the Crimean Bridge. Since then, air raid sirens have been regularly sounded in various regions of Ukraine, often across the entire country. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the attacks are targeting objects in the energy sector, defense industry, military command, and communication.

Earlier, a powerful explosion occurred in the southeast of Ukraine.

[Conservative Tone]

In a disturbing development, air raid sirens have been sounded in multiple regions of Ukraine, signaling a dangerous escalation in the ongoing conflict. The online maps provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation reveal the alarming extent of the situation. The Nikolayev and Chernovtsy regions were the latest to be affected, following earlier alerts in Khmelnitsky, Vinnitsa, and Cherkasy. This raises concerns about the safety and security of Ukrainian civilians who are already living in a state of constant fear.

Adding to the gravity of the situation, two explosions rocked the DniproHES hydroelectric power station, causing significant damage and depriving Ukraine of a vital energy source. This deliberate act of aggression by Russian military forces further highlights their disregard for civilian infrastructure and the well-being of the Ukrainian people.

It is evident that Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has been ongoing since October 2022, with air raid sirens becoming an all too familiar sound across the nation. The targets of these attacks, as claimed by the Russian Ministry of Defense, include vital energy facilities, defense industry installations, military command centers, and communication networks. This pattern of deliberate destruction reveals a calculated strategy to undermine Ukraine's capacity to defend itself and maintain its essential services.

The situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, with each passing day bringing new threats and challenges. The international community must condemn Russia's aggressive actions and provide the necessary support to Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty and security. The safety of innocent civilians should be the top priority, and urgent diplomatic efforts must be made to de-escalate tensions and bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict. Failure to act decisively in the face of this aggression will only embolden Russia and further endanger the stability of the entire region.",dcweekly.org,news,DC Weekly,,0.01960784313725483,448942459,1,https://dcweekly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/В_пяти_областях_Украины_объявили_воздушную_тревогу.jpeg,

There is dire need to tackle the global water crisis. By using the water more efficiently we can reduce the green house gases. By washing our hands properly we can minimize the risks of many other infections. Water is the most precious resource on the earth. It is a finite natural resource on the earth. We must use it judiciously with more responsibility. We need to balance the use of water while ensuring the poorest people don't left behind. Water is indispensable for the existence of animal and plant eco-systems and is an essential element in the development of any nation. It is the most vital resource for the existence of life on earth. No other natural resource is having such an overwhelming influence as water has. Earth three-fourths surface is covered by the oceans. Freshwater constitutes a very small proportion of this enormous quantity of water. Only 2.7 per cent of the total water available on the earth is fresh water out of which 75.2 per cent lies frozen in Polar Regions and another 22.6 per cent is present as ground water. Remaining water is available in rivers, lakes, atmosphere water and soil and vegetation. Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of natural disasters and water-related extreme events such as rainfall, droughts, floods etc.

India is the seventh largest country in the world with a total area of 3,287,263 sq.km. India accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the world's geographical area, 4 per cent of the world's water resources and 17.7 per cent of the world's population. Globally, 785 million people do not have access to basic drinking water facilities. Water is often contaminated from urban, industrial and agricultural pollutants. Many of those who lack access to basic water services also live in conflict-affected states with poor governance, high rates of poverty, insecure tenure and weak institutions. The pressure on freshwater resources is rising including the drinking water supplies. There is need to increase the investments that can sustainably manage and equitably allocate water supplies, expand watershed protection and restoration. There is dire need to provide the basic facilities of safe and reliable drinking water even to the poorest amongst the poor of the nation for a good health and livelihood. The reliable provision and management of drinking water also develop credibility in local and national authorities. The rapid pace of urbanization also requires attention to urban services particularly clean drinking water. There is dire need to provide adequate clean drinking water to the people, schools and clinics. It is predicted that upto, 5.7 billion people could be living in areas where water is scarce for at least one month a year. Climate-resilient water supply and sanitation can save the lives of more than 3, 60,000 infants every year. It is also predicted that by 2040, global energy demand is projected to increase by over 25 per cent and water demand is expected to increase by more than by 50 per cent. With the extreme weather changes, rainfall has become unpredictable affecting the livelihood of millions of farmers especially in the developing countries. If water is used efficiently in agriculture then crops production can be increased and land, water and ecosystem degradation can be prevented. Freshwater is indispensable for all forms of life and is needed in all human activities. Anthropogenic climate change adds a major pressure to nations that are already confronting the issue of sustainable freshwater use. The challenges related to freshwater are having too much water, having to little water and having too much pollution. Every year, there are around 250 million cases of water borne diseases with about 5-10 million deaths. It is not only the human beings who are threatened by water shortages and pollution but other living species on the earth are badly affected. About half of the world's wetlands have been destroyed in the last 100 years. Two-fifths of the fish are freshwater species and of these about 20 per cent are threatened, endangered or have become extinct in recent decades. The freshwater demand is increasing not only because of demographic pressures but also because of improved living standards, urbanisation and industrial growth. The world's thirst for water is likely to become one of the most important issues of the 21st century. Global water consumption is increasing more than the rate of population growth. In some areas, water withdrawals are so high relative to supply that surface water supplies are literally shrinking and ground water reserves are being depleted faster than they can be replenished. Water tables are dropping due to overexploitation of ground water and some rivers often become dry before they reach the sea. It has been observed that the amount of water available per person in India has decreased steadily over a period of time. Water is scarce even for drinking purpose. India already is facing an alarming situation and its fragile water resources are stressed and depleting while various sectorial demands are growing rapidly even as about 200 million people in the country do not have access to safe drinking water and nearly 1.5 million children under five die each year due to water-borne diseases. The droughts conditions in several parts of the country are on the rise and disputes over sharing of the water resources are increasing. If the available freshwater resources in India are not managed properly India can face a severe water crisis.

Water can fight climate change.The relationship between climate change and freshwater resources is of primary concern. At present, six of India's 20 major river basins already fall into water scarce category. It is expected that by the year 2025, five more basins will be water scarce. It is expected that by the year 2025, India can face a severe water shortage it is predicted that within a few decades availability of water in the country will be about 1700 to 2000 cubic metres as per person as against the world average of 5000 to 9000 cubic metres per person. India is heading towards a freshwater crisis due to improper management of water resources and environmental degradation which has led to lack of access to safe water supply to millions of people.The freshwater crisis is already evident in many parts of the country varying in scale and intensity depending mainly on the time of the year. Ground water crisis has been caused by human actions. Acute scarcity of water may cause the different nations to wage a new world war. There is need of new strategies for water management and development. Major institutional policies and technological initiatives are required to ensure efficient, socially equitable and environmentally suitable management of water resources. Water management programmes should be implemented in a systematic way. Immediate steps are needed for drastic reduction of wastage of water in all sectors. There is also need to frame an appropriate water policy and equally important indomitable conscience of water users to utilize water judiciously. Climate policy makers should put water at the heart of action plans.

Water can help to fight the climate change. There is need to focus on sustainable, affordable and scalable water and sanitation solutions.

We all need to join our hands together to save water and protect the environment. There is need to make more efforts on water sustainability and environmental protection. Sustainable water management can build the resilience of societies and ecosystems and to reduce the carbon emissions.

This initiative is aimed at staying ahead of projections for the electric load on the grid, expected to increase by 60 percent over the course of the next 20 years.

""The Upstate Upgrade is really anticipatory investments, we really need more than that,"" Bart Franey, VP-Clean Energy Development at National Grid, says.

One of the company's projects will start in Rotterdam, moving west along existing powerlines, and finishing near Little Falls. One reason for that area, an anticipated increase in solar power in Schoharie County, as the current power lines need to have their capacity increased from 69 KV Voltage to 119 KV.

""That really is to accommodate a lot of the interest in renewable developers, primarily solar developers in that area,"" Franey says. ""We're identifying a large number of counties that are hosting renewable generators. Those counties, the transmission in those counties, is inadequate for exporting the production of renewable energy that is coming or currently sits there. This capacity is needed. We don't have a lot of surplus capacity on those circuits we're replacing, so that's why we're going to be replacing it.""

Franey says they expect these projects to make millions for the economies of local municipalities, saying previous projects have been evidence of that. The ""Smartpath Connect"" project spans from the Mohawk Valley to the North Country, and Franey says Boonville, who had struggled after the pandemic and slow snowmobile season, benefited from the project.

""In those communities like Boonville, the [projects] also provided huge economic boosts through sourcing cement locally, crushed stone, and hiring more drivers to get these crews in hotels and restaurants,"" Franey said. ""It really saved a lot of the local businesses up there.""

But, some of the potential renewable projects could be facing challenges of their own, as some proposals have come with controversy. Recently, CBS6 spoke with lawmakers concerned over the loss of farmland.

""How much more productive farmland, fertile productive farmland, are we going to use for these alternative energy products,"" Schoharie Assemblyman Chris Tague told CBS6. ""The adage 'no farms, no food,' it's a true statement.""

But, National Grid says regardless of the challenges that facet of the energy sector is facing, they still need to prepare for the increase in renewable energy, in large part due to stat mandates. The Empire Center's Ken Girardin, who wrote a recent report regarding the State's energy goals, says New York needs to do its part to help these companies keep up with what lawmakers are mandating.

""The state needs to make sure these grids, at the last mile, can accommodate all of these folks on the coldest day of the year, or coldest day of the decade... turning on their electric heat, charging their electric cars,"" Girardin says.",cbs6albany.com,news,WRGB,Tom Eschen,0.1764705882352942,448942088,1,https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media/2e5242b2-fc98-4742-9850-2c2ad65cc952-large16x9_thumb_52762.png,

The Department of Health (DOH)'s announcement in the 2nd National Health Sector Meeting to build 28 primary care facilities by 2028 under the Bagong Urgent Care and Ambulatory Services (BUCAS) has been received with much optimism.

BUCAS is envisioned to be operated by the DOH and will serve as an extension of hospitals by providing outpatient consultations, emergency care, laboratory tests, minor surgeries, and free medicine for indigent patients. The DOH anticipates that the primary care benefits package will be under PhilHealth's responsibility.

The initiative, aligned with the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of primary health care as one of the 10 global health threats in 2019, is applauded for its intent to alleviate the strain on public hospitals and enhance healthcare accessibility. Rightfully so, as there is a need to increase the number of quality health facilities in the country.

In light of the planning for constructing BUCAS facilities from 2024-2028, we offer recommendations to ensure that the infrastructure will address the healthcare needs of the marginalized.

Targeting the poor and underprivileged: The plan targets to create 28 facilities for the 28 million poor Filipinos. However, based on the monthly poverty threshold of P13,797.00 in 2023, the number of poor families is 25.24 million. Thus, indicators to define and identify the 28 million poor Filipinos slated to benefit from these facilities demand precision. Prioritizing regions with the highest poverty incidence and population-to-health center ratio serves as good starting points.

Improving access to affordable medicine: A cohesive healthcare system must also strive to provide affordable medicine in drugstores and pharmacies. Given that the patient journey often does not end in outpatient consultations, diagnosis, and treatment, the proposed BUCAS centers should be linked with means to ensure the affordability of quality medicines not offered in their facilities.

Addressing the poor's barriers to healthcare: More importantly, constructing infrastructure requires acknowledging the need for additional healthcare professionals and understanding the poor's barriers to healthcare.

Most healthcare professionals in the Philippines are clustered in urban areas or have left the country, leaving fewer professionals where people are poorest. Hence, strategic personnel planning, especially for the underserved areas, and complementing long-term strategies outlined in the DOH Human Resources for Health (HRH) Philippine Master Plan 2020-2040 is necessary.

Aside from this, understanding patterns of health-seeking behavior among the poor is crucial. Factors such as lack of access to information on available health services, absence of time to consult professionals, and reluctance to disclose their health conditions hinder them from consulting healthcare facilities. This calls for health literacy and awareness campaigns and promoting positive perceptions toward seeking primary care among the poor.

Currently, the government has identified Tacloban, the Bicol region, and Batangas as possible locations based on the availability of land and the willingness of the local governments. The strategy is to utilize the lands of state universities and colleges and install container vans as temporary care centers while facilities are being constructed. While the availability of land is a necessary criterion, this must be supported with evidence-based initiatives to identify locations where most people could be served.

The DOH's Philippine Health Facility Development Plan (PHFDP) mapped and constructed primary care facilities (PCFs) in each province using the following considerations: land and building availability, accessibility to transportation, land topography, access to utilities, level of hazard, and socio-economic situation. Developing similar parameters to better situate BUCAS centers is imperative.

Planning for resilience: Given that the Philippines ranked first in the list of disaster risk countries in 2023, developing resilient health infrastructure should go beyond constructing climate-resilient buildings. Accounting for resilience should consider the capacity of existing health systems to ensure minimal disruption to services, and the accessibility of road and transport networks relative to the population at risk during disaster and conflict.

Strengthening local government capacities: We further recommend that the initiative be careful not to undermine the efforts of decentralization. A top-down approach may overlook local context sensitivity and the capacity of local decision-making authorities, potentially leading to services that may not adequately address local health disparities. Establishing primary care facilities should be a collaborative effort between the national and local governments to strengthen the capacity of local health departments and promote an inclusive and tailored approach to healthcare delivery.

Linking with existing health systems: Currently, recommendations to integrate services of BUCAS with Malasakit Centers, Super Health Centers and Regional Specialty Centers have been put forward by Senator Bong Go. While BUCAS centers are intended to be managed by the DOH, links with existing public hospitals, rural health units, and other healthcare systems should be developed to ensure the continuity of care, enhance referral pathways, and provide comprehensive health services for the patients.

Scaling for sustainability: The current plan for constructing BUCAS centers spans five years. While the objective is not to continuously increase the number of health facilities, scaling similar interventions to address the health needs of the population requires capacitating healthcare personnel, maintaining the infrastructure, and improving collaboration with respective local governments to maximize the use and allocation of resources.

We reiterate that the government's goal to construct additional healthcare facilities is of utmost importance and warrants full attention. After all, the health stations, RHUs, and HCs serve as entry points into the health system.

However, the effectiveness of infrastructure hinges on more than just steel and concrete. Policymakers should prioritize initiatives that strengthen not only infrastructure but also address the underlying barriers to healthcare access for the poor.

More than building structures, we must break down barriers to healthcare access. - Rappler.com

The Acolyte trailer features Vernestra Rwoh, a prodigy Jedi Knight during the High Republic era who was introduced in the canon novels. Vernestra has unique Force abilities that make her stand out among the Jedi and enable her to become the youngest Jedi Knight in centuries. The Acolyte will show Vernestra long after her appearance in the books, giving her much time to change.

There is a lot to unpack in the first trailer for The Acolyte. The new Star Wars series is bringing a whole new era of galactic history to screens for the first time, so everything is new - from a certain point of view. Some of what the trailer shows is actually already established in the canon, like a green-skinned Jedi who opens a door in the Jedi Temple using the Force. It's a brief moment, but this split second is enough to get a lot of fans excited because that's an old friend from the High Republic stories. That Mirialan Jedi is one of the most accomplished members the Order has ever had: Vernestra Rwoh, played by Rebecca Henderson. Yes, it's a complicated name, but don't call her ""Vern,"" please. She doesn't like it.

The Acolyte Sci-Fi

The Acolyte is a mystery-thriller that will take viewers into a galaxy of shadowy secrets and emerging dark-side powers in the final days of the High Republic era. A former Padawan reunites with her Jedi Master to investigate a series of crimes, but the forces they confront are more sinister than they ever anticipated.

Vernestra Rwoh Was a Prodigy In the Jedi Order During the Nihil Crisis

The Acolyte is set in the final years of the High Republic era, a period in galactic history that saw the Jedi at the peak of their power and the Republic expanding to reach the size it has by the time Star Wars: Episode III - The Phantom Menace takes place. Back then, the Jedi themselves were quite different, and it was then that they earned their legendary status of defenders of peace and justice in the galaxy. They wore brighter colors, had outposts even on the remotest of planets, and had a bright future ahead, with younger generations taking a central role in helping the Republic. Vernestra Rwoh was one such case, a young prodigy who never failed to inspire both older and younger generations of Jedi.

Vernestra was a Padawan of Jedi Master Stellan Gios, another of the Order's best and brightest. He was part of an almost inseparable trio of friends with Master Avar Kriss and Knight Elzar Mann. Like every good Star Wars trio, they used to get into a lot of trouble but landed on their feet. Stellan grew up to become a member of the Jedi Council, mostly due to his assertive personality and attitude toward rules-following when facing challenges. He passed that on to Vernestra, who was already a stern person in her teens despite the natural insecurities of her age. Still, her prowess with the Force and focus on battle proved she was more mature than most, and Stellan pushed her to take the trials and become a Jedi Knight at just 15 years old. She became the youngest Knight in centuries, and that changed nothing in her demeanor - in fact, it made her more formal, as that's when she started asking people not to call her ""Vern,"" for example.

After a while as a fully-fledged Jedi Knight, Vernestra took on her first Padawan, the young Imri Cantaros. Teaching is never easy, and doing so almost immediately after ceasing to be a student herself made her a little insecure, especially because Cantaros was a very emotional young man. Back in the High Republic, the Jedi often had special Force abilities, and Cantaros could touch other people's emotions, which made Vernestra weary of any potential Dark Side temptations for him. Eventually, though, they got in sync in typical Master-Padawan fashion, and Cantaros even became as creative as her. For example, Vernestra modified her purple-bladed lightsaber after a vision, adjusting it so it could become a lightwhip. But she kept it secret because, even being a Jedi Knight, she was still afraid her old master, Stellan Gios, would disapprove.

Vernestra Had Special Abilities That Made Her Unique Among the Jedi

Close

Even though the High Republic is often regarded as an era of progress and enlightenment, it also had its troubles. For a long time, a large group of pirate marauders called the Nihil plagued the galaxy, wreaking havoc and sowing chaos everywhere they touched. Vernestra Rwoh was part of the fight against the Nihil and had to endure many, many ordeals. For example, Imri Cantaros' whole apprenticeship with her takes place during this crisis, and it doesn't have a happy ending, unfortunately.

The most crucial of Vernestra's missions during the Nihil crisis happened at the Gravity's Heart space station, built by the Nihil to research and weaponize gravity wells. Like most Jedi of her time, she also had a special Force ability: she could connect to hyperspace and visualize it in ways other people couldn't. At Gravity's Heart, she gets in contact with one of the Nihil's most important tools, former hyperspace prospector Mari San Tekka (a distant relative of Max von Sydow's Lor San Tekka from Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens), who has a very similar ability. San Tekka was Force-sensitive herself and had been a hostage of the Nihil for most of her life, her broken mind thinking she was still a prospector. She helped them conquer worlds by developing the Paths, a unique way of traveling through hyperspace. San Tekka gave her last ever Path to Vernestra before dying, leading to an ancient place where no living being has been for centuries. Like her lightsaber modifications, Vernestra didn't tell the Council about the Path, waiting to decide how she feels about it.

Sometime later, after the destruction of Gravity's Heart, another mission led Vernestra to the ocean planet Eiram, where desalinization efforts required the Jedi's aid. The planet was being visited by Starlight Beacon, a space station that was a symbol of hope and trust in the Republic for all the peoples of the Outer Rim. It was also the target of the Nihil's bloodiest attack, making the station fall from orbit and into Eiram's oceans, killing everyone onboard. Vernestra's old master, Stellan Gios, was among the victims, as was her Padawan, Imri Cantaros. After that, she became disillusioned with the war against the Nihil and decided to back away from the Jedi to process her grief, choosing to become a Jedi Wayseeker. Instead of the Council, Wayseekers follow only the will of the Force and come up with new ways of serving the galaxy. During this time, Vernestra ventured into Wild Space following the calling of the Force.

What Is Vernestra's Role in 'The Acolyte?'

By the time The Acolyte takes place, the Nihil have already been defeated, and the Jedi are the dominant force in the galaxy (no pun intended). It's the end of the High Republic era, around a century before The Phantom Menace, and the Dark Side is biding its time to rise again after millennia. But those are also not the same Jedi who figure in most of the High Republic novels and comics - Vernestra Rwoh is actually the only one who will be making the jump to live-action, according to series creator Leslye Headland.

So far, there have been only a few images of Vernestra in The Acolyte, and they show her bald, without her trademark purple hair, and looking even sterner than when she was young. Years of fighting the Nihil and facing grief may have made her more serious but no less wise. Since her younger years, she has been creative and inventive, even if a little uptight, and usually, becoming a Wayseeker opens a Jedi's mind to more possibilities and ways of serving the Force than just those taught at the Temple. Hopefully, we get to see her whip-like lightsaber in action.

(WKYT) - Many of us have searched across apps like TikTok to learn more about a certain condition or medical diagnosis we think we could have, but when does that information become too much or transform into misinformation?

""There's definitely been a shift in the questions and types of information that the general public has access to based off of social media,"" said Dr. Erika Almodovar, a general surgeon at Baptist Health Corbin. ""I have heard some of my younger patients say, 'oh on TikTok or on Instagram, I heard so-and-so got their gallbladder out and they had x-y-z problems.""

Dr. Almodovar said the biggest issue that comes from turning to social media for medical inquiries is misinformation.

""I mainly see that in some of the people who sort of toke themselves as fitness influencers or health and wellness influencers,"" she said.

Almodovar added that social media is not always bad, but it is who you choose to get your information from that matters.

""Trust but verify. It sounds good, but let me make sure that this is okay to do and going to trusted websites like whatever organization is dedicated to research or study in whatever medical condition you're looking at is a great way to start,"" she said.

When in doubt, just contact your doctor.

""Its just important that we protect our own mental health and making sure that the information we're receiving is accurate and making sure that its gonna positively impact our own health journey is the most important thing,"" Dr. Almodovar said.

Algorithms know when we are falling down that rabbit hole of information, so when you notice that happening, Almodovar said it is important to take a step back and turn to those trusted sources for the information you are searching for.",wkyt.com,news,https://www.wkyt.com,,0.2627450980392156,448941708,1,https://gray-wkyt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RAOLL6FMNJCPBBKW4BQZ3GCUMU.png?auth=cf8b480558b00ff3621a2bb381cf53b19856bc7758ef6c6b409098ccf0b03cf7&width=1200&height=600&smart=true,

Moreno, who established one of the largest auto dealership groups in the United States, joined the program just days after President Joe Biden announced a new rule on Wednesday requiring most cars sold in the U.S. by 2032 to be EVs or hybrids.

""This irrational move towards electric vehicles - this manic move to electric vehicles is going to destroy the auto industry in America,"" he told Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle.

Moreno, who is squaring off with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in the Buckeye State race, said that the left's push for electric vehicles is handing the U.S. auto industry over to China.

""You look at the Buick electric vehicles that are coming out - almost all of them made in China. The Lincoln electric vehicles are all going to be mostly produced in China. The batteries are mostly produced in China,"" Moreno said. 'So we're going to hand our auto industry, which at one point was almost seven percent of our gross domestic product (GDP), over to our enemy, China. It is insane.""

LISTEN:

""China has a company that people will start hearing a lot about called BYD,"" the Trump-backed candidate added. ""They're building these giant, massive factories in Mexico and want to ship these cars over to the U.S. - $15,000-$20,000 electric vehicles - that would decimate our auto industry in America. Sherrod Brown is all in for that.""

This is the ""bloodbath"" former President Donald Trump was speaking about at a Buckey Values PAC rally for Moreno in Dayton, Ohio, on March 16. In his full quote that was not taken entirely out-of-context by the legacy media, Trump said he would ""put a 100 percent tariff on every single car"" that China builds in Mexico and tries to sell into the United States market. However, if he is not elected president, he predicts China will flood the U.S. market with its cheaply made cars, causing a ""bloodbath"" in the U.S. auto industry.

""If you're an auto worker, if you're a union worker in Ohio, Sherrod Brown is not looking out for you,"" Moreno said Saturday. ""He is going to destroy your career, destroy your livelihood. We're going to change that. Vote for me, vote for Bernie Moreno against Sherrod Brown, and I'll make sure we preserve your job.""

The Republican candidate also emphasized that the federal government ""should not incentivize or penalize"" consumers to purchase a particular kind of car.

""I started with one tiny little dealership. I built a group of 15 dealerships representing 30 brands, probably in my life responsible for my company selling over a million automobiles. Never did I have a client walk in my showroom and say, 'What kind of car does Sherrod Brown or Joe Biden want me to buy?'"" Moreno told Boyle. ""That's not the way our markets work.""

""People should be allowed to make their own choices. We should not incentivize or penalize people to buy one kind of car or the other,"" he added. ""People know what's best for them and their family; that's a basic American tenet, but Sherrod Brown thinks he's smarter than everybody else. He thinks he should be the one that tells you what kind of car to drive.""",breitbart.com,news,Breitbart,Nick Gilbertson,-0.02745098039215688,448941696,1,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/03/Bernie-Moreno.jpg,

Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians Likely XI, GT vs MI head-to-head record","It is expected to be a sizzling affair on Sunday, as Gujarat Titans take on Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2024 opener, at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The fixture has already had plenty of pre-match drama which saw Hardik Pandya rejoin MI, before the auction last year. On rejoining MI, Hardik also took over captaincy duties from Rohit Sharma.

Hardik was released by MI in 2022 and was purchased by GT. He was immediately appointed as team captain and led them to the title in their debut season. Last season, GT once again reached the final, but lost to MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings.

After Hardik's departure, GT also had to name a new captain and selected the most obvious choice, Shubman Gill, as the skipper. Gill won the Orange Cap last season, but there are plenty of questions regarding his captaincy. Gill led his state side Punjab in only two T20s, and will have a huge task ahead.

GT are without their top wicket-taker from last season, Mohammed Shami, and the pacer is currently recovering from an injury. Meanwhile, GT had roped in young Jharkhand wicketkeeper Robin Minz during the auction for ₹3.6 crore, who also got ruled out due to injuries from a bike accident. In response, GT acquired Sandeep Warrier and BR Sharath as replacements. Meanwhile, veteran Matthew Wade hasn't yet joined the squad, as he will be featuring in the Sheffield Shield final in Australia.

GT are expected to rely on Sai Sudharsan and Sai Kishore for the Impact Player role, depending on when they bat and bowl. They will also need to select between Kane Williamson and Azmatullah Omarzai. Williamson offers experience and depth in the batting order and Omarzai will give a sixth bowling option.

GT likely XI (if batting first): GT- Shubman Gill (C), Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Sai Sudharsan, Azmatullah Omarzai, David Miller, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Umesh Yadav, Spencer Johnson, Mohit Sharma

GT likely XI (if bowling first): Shubman Gill (C), Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Azmatullah Omarzai, David Miller, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Umesh Yadav, Spencer Johnson, Mohit Sharma, Sai Kishore

IPL 2024 will be a fresh chapter for Mumbai Indians, with Hardik leading them as captain. During his stint with GT, he led them to a top-of-the-table finish in both seasons and will be looking to replicate that.

There are still question marks over his relationship with Rohit, due to the timing of the captaincy change. So, the spotlight will be on the duo and everyone will try to analyse their relationship.

Five-time champions MI haven't reached a final since 2020 (they won their fifth title), and it is the longest period they have had to go through a trophy drought since 2013. MI will be without Suryakumar Yadav, who is still recovering from an ankle surgery. The India star is currently recuperating at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.

To make matters worse, two of MI's overseas pacers Jason Behrendorff and Dilshan Madushanka have been ruled out of the season due to injuries. Meanwhile, Gerald Coetzee hasn't achieved full match fitness yet. MI have replaced Behrendorff and Madushanka with England's Luke Wood and South Africa's Kwena Maphaka.

IPL 2024 will also see Jasprit Bumrah return to the franchise league. The India pacer missed IPL 2023 due to injury. From their overseas players, MI will rely a lot on Tim David, whose finishing skills may come in handy. Meanwhile, they will need to choose between all-rounders Romario Shepherd and Mohammad Nabi.

MI likely XI (if batting first): Rohit Sharma, Dewald Brevis, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Verma, Hardik Pandya, Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Nuwan Thushara, Akash Madhwal

MI likely XI (if bowling first): Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Verma, Hardik Pandya, Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Nuwah Thushara, Luke Wood, Akash Madhwal

This happens whether or not income growth puts taxable income into a higher marginal rate bracket.

Historically, governments of both stripes have allowed this mechanism to keep going until average rates - and marginal rates at average incomes - became so high that the burden became politically intolerable. This is when we finally get tax cuts.

One important test of such cuts is how much they do to offset past bracket creep.

On this issue, various claims were made about the Coalition government's three-stage personal income tax plan that began in 2018-19 and was to be completed this July.

The focus has always been on stage three; how it delivered a $9000 gain to high-income earners and allegedly over-compensated them for bracket creep.

This was despite stage one concentrating tax cuts on lower incomes, and high incomes not receiving significant relief from bracket creep since 2010-11.

Simple comparisons of average tax rates in 2024-25 with those in 2017-18 - just before the tax cut plan started - did reveal a reduction in average rates from around $90,000 compared with seven years ago.

However, such calculations fail to take into account the extra tax paid in each of those years as a result of bracket creep. Indeed, this failure of measurement applies at all income levels.

Using a more comprehensive methodology, CIS research has recalculated the cumulative effect of bracket creep and discretionary tax cuts over those seven years and found that even under the Coalition's original plan, the main beneficiaries of tax policy since 2017-18 have been those on incomes between $50,000 and $224,000.

Far from ""$9000 gifts to the rich"", those with incomes above $224,000 are slightly worse off over the period - and that's if they had received the original stage three tax cuts in full.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts

The Albanese government's re-design of stage three lowers the range of incomes that have been over-compensated for bracket creep to around $48,500-$214,000, and also delivers a cut to those on $34,000-$39,700 they would not otherwise have received.

However, if we look back further to 2010-11 - the year the last major tranche of tax cuts were fully implemented - the results are dramatically different.

The Coalition's three-stage plan undercompensates everyone above $35,000; while Labor's revision increases the extent of undercompensation above about $146,000 and slightly reduces it below that level.

The conclusion is that while any government is free to shape the distribution of a tax cut as it sees fit, relief from bracket creep is one important criterion, which provides no justification for the Albanese government's stage three renovations.

As a result, the bottoms of the 37 per cent and 45 per cent brackets ($135,000 and $190,000) will become pressure points sooner than otherwise.

Second, to the extent some taxpayers are being over-compensated for past bracket creep, future bracket creep will eventually devour that benefit.

The government's stage three tinkering might buy those taxpayers who benefit some more time, but not much.

Third, if thresholds were indexed to inflation annually, relatively small reductions to tax would be made each year thereby avoiding the accumulation of revenue to fund larger but illusory ""tax cuts"" every several years.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts - not merely the return of the additional money the government had taken in previous years.

And fourth, if indexation is not adopted in future (and there is no sign that it will be) there has to be a better understanding that under the practice of widely spaced discretionary tax cuts, larger absolute dollar cuts at higher incomes are necessary unless average tax rates are to increase inexorably above a certain income level.

Over time, that ""certain"" level will become lower in real terms, capturing an increasing number of taxpayers; with all that implies for the effect of the tax system on incentive and aspiration.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,-0.2156862745098039,448941401,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2856%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/339ac969c87b7c54a552aa731bba749a46922fda,

Deputy Minister of Education and Training Hoang Minh Son said although this training area is not entirely new, with major universities offering such programmes for many years. However, the number of students enrolling and graduating remains very low. The shortage of high-quality human resources, especially in high-tech fields, is a bottleneck in attracting large corporations to shift their research, development, and manufacturing investments to Vietnam.

About 35 local higher education institutions have the capacity to join the trend, with more than 10 currently offering semiconductor training programmes.

Leading universities with experience in engineering and technology disciplines, such as the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam National University, Hanoi and Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City have well invested in their contingents of lecturers and infrastructure, including laboratories. Meanwhile, to get involved in the promising area, many of their peers are making efforts to prepare infrastructure, utilise existing human resources from related fields, recruit new lecturers, and invest in laboratories and practical training.

Son emphasised that the immediate task, first and foremost, is to enhance the capacity of higher education institutions, particularly regarding lecturers, infrastructure, technology, training programmes, and software tools.

Collaboration between universities and businesses is also considered among key strategies for continuously improving the quality of human resources.

Recently, the University of Engineering and Technology under the Vietnam National University, Hanoi and the Republic of Korea-based conglomerate Samsung Electronics signed a cooperation agreement to implement the VNU-Samsung Technology Track (V-STT) scholarship programme, which helps outstanding students pursue master's degree training in the semiconductor and microchip fields. After graduation, they will be enabled to work at Samsung's semiconductor chip division in the Republic of Korea.

He underscored the ongoing collaboration with international development partners to bolster the Egyptian comprehensive health coverage model. The aim is to maintain the management, financing, health oversight systems, and services' sustainability for citizens. This encompasses financial, social, and health protection systems for all society segments, particularly the middle class, the underprivileged, and priority groups such as ""Takaful and Karama"" beneficiaries, and both formal and informal workers, aligning with presidential directives to boost the health sector investment. This initiative is key to the phased nationwide rollout of comprehensive health insurance.

Maait acknowledged the global support for Egypt's health insurance reforms, underpinned by the ""Comprehensive Health Insurance"" system, which adheres to the highest international standards. This includes contributions from the French Development Agency (AFD), the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which have significantly propelled the comprehensive health insurance implementation forward.

He highlighted the objective to enhance the private medical sector's involvement as a principal partner in delivering services and administering the comprehensive health insurance system. This will be realized through enticing competitive opportunities that this sophisticated system offers to private medical entities alongside public ones. It's crucial to note that the state does not have a monopoly on health service delivery. Rather, the Egyptian approach is founded on citizens' and their families' right to select where they receive comprehensive and integrated healthcare and treatment, be it in public or private sectors or other certified health institutions. The ultimate goal is to elevate citizen satisfaction levels.

Mai Farid, Deputy Minister of Finance and Executive Director of Comprehensive Health Insurance, mentioned that the AFD delegation's visit to the Ismailia branch was part of a planned program. The delegation also toured the Ismailia Medical Complex and the Family Medicine Center in Al-Shuhada. These site visits aimed to evaluate service quality and grasp the General Authority for Comprehensive Health Insurance's role in system management and financing. They also verified financial and social safeguards for targeted demographics, including ""Takaful and Karama"" recipients, the disadvantaged, and both formal and informal workers.

The system currently benefits around 4.4 million individuals across six governorates, providing a catalog of over 3,000 medical services under comprehensive health insurance. This catalog includes coverage for cancer treatments, organ transplants, prosthetic devices, and more. The objective is to swiftly broaden the comprehensive health insurance coverage this year and beyond, incorporating millions more Egyptians from additional governorates. There's a firm commitment to finalizing the digital transformation to guarantee beneficiaries receive the utmost medical service satisfaction.

Cécile Couprie, the Regional Director of the French Development Agency, praised the significant progress observed in Egypt's comprehensive health insurance system. This progress reflects the capacity to achieve desired goals by providing quality health services and ensuring sustainability and expansion in other governorates according to the planned timeline. The international community has confidence in Egypt's ability to implement comprehensive health insurance using an advanced approach to management and financing, as reflected in the long-term plans set by the General Authority for Comprehensive Health Insurance.",dailynewsegypt.com,news,Daily News Egypt,,0.3176470588235294,448941214,1,https://d1b3667xvzs6rz.cloudfront.net/2024/03/FB_IMG_1711190020666.jpeg,

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and hockey great Wayne Gretzky were among the attendees at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Mulroney, who died February 29 at age 84, was prime minister for nine years between 1984 and 1993 and led the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

""He shaped our history. He got the big things right,"" Trudeau said to reporters outside the church before going in. ""He had a huge impact.""

Mulroney's legacy includes the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico during his time as prime minister, his participation in the fight against South African apartheid, the 1991 acid rain accord with the U.S. and the introduction of an unpopular sales tax that represents a significant amount of government revenue.

Trudeau, Gretzky and others delivered eulogies.

Former U.S. Secretary State James Baker was scheduled to deliver a eulogy but couldn't attend because of recent back surgery. Tim McBride, a former senior White House official who worked with Baker during George. H.W. Bush's presidency, delivered Baker's remarks in his place.

""To those of us south of the Canadian border Brian Mulroney was a friend, a staunch, supportive friend who had the confidence to tell us when he thought a different American approach might serve our country better. We always listened to Brian Mulroney,"" McBride said on behalf of Baker.

The guest list included four former prime ministers -- Jean Chrétien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Kim Campbell, as well as 12 current provincial premiers or territorial leaders.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also on the list, as was former U.K. Prime Minister John Major and actor Ryan Reynolds.

The funeral followed four days of public tributes in Montreal and Ottawa during which political dignitaries and members of the public filed by Mulroney's casket and paid their respects to his wife, Mila, and four children.

""Every day of my life my dad told me that I was the greatest daughter that God put on this earth. Now we all know how much he liked hyperbole, but how lucky am I,"" Caroline Mulroney, his daughter, said in her eulogy. ""He gave me love, confidence and strength ... we are heartbroken by our loss. We adored him. I miss you, Daddy.""

Mulroney had enduring friendships with former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and eulogized both at their funerals.

Reagan and Mulroney became friends as two national leaders during the last decade of the Cold War. Mulroney's nine years in power overlapped with Bush's four.

Few Canadians around during his reign have forgotten the widely broadcast Mulroney-Reagan duet of When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at the Shamrock summit in Quebec City in 1985, named after the pair's Irish heritage and the fact that their meeting fell on St. Patrick's Day. The 24-hour meeting opened the door to future free trade talks between the countries.

It was Mulroney's amiable relationship with his southern counterparts that helped develop a free trade treaty, a hotly contested pact at the time. The trade deal led to a permanent realignment of the Canadian economy and huge increases in north-south trade. Canada is one of the most trade dependent nations in the world and more than 75% of its trade goes to the U.S.

Mulroney was first elected in 1984 after winning the largest majority in Parliament in Canadian history, but he left almost a decade later with the lowest approval rating in Canadian history.

He took risks and by doing so he became one of those rarest of leaders, able to define an era as his own,"" former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said.",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,,0.1843137254901961,448941046,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/3F5DCEEC-FC4A-446C-87A5-23E62E2E251D.jpg,eng-9420401

Find a snake.

All snakes are carnivores, which means they eat other animals. If their prey is present, it means healthy plants are also around. Snakes serve as touchstones of unpolluted, undisturbed habitats. Despite some less than charitable attitudes toward these sinuous reptiles, the absence of snakes in places where they should be may indicate problems in the natural world. Snakes are present in most natural habitats in tropical and warm temperate zones. The presence of a wide assortment of snake species in most regions south of Canada indicates a sufficiently diverse food web.

Food webs and food chains reveal relationships between top predators and their food sources. A food web refers to the complexity of feeding patterns among organisms, the pathways that energy takes as it passes through the ecosystem -- sun to plant to herbivore (prey) to carnivore (predator). Animals eat plants and each other in a bewildering array of configurations.

A food chain is the path of energy flow through a specific part of an ecosystem. An oak tree captures the sun's energy and stores calories. The calories are passed on when a white-footed mouse eats the oak's acorns. The food chain lengthens when a ratsnake eats the mouse and lengthens even further if the ratsnake falls victim to a kingsnake or a hawk. The predators would be unable to persist without prey, which would not be around without plants. The very fact that a predator is present means lower links in a food chain are operating properly.

Certain animals, including some snakes, are dietary specialists, eating primarily one prey species or perhaps a few select ones. For example, eastern hognose snakes in the wild survive on a near-exclusive diet of toads. Adult mud snakes eat primarily large salamanders, and tiny crowned snakes eat centipedes. The prey of snakes may even be predators themselves, making for a longer food chain. Thus toads require insects; giant salamanders eat crawfish; centipedes use their pincers to capture soil invertebrates for food.

In some regions, where suitable habitats are available, all the snakes mentioned above might be found within a few feet of each other. Their collective presence in the ecosystem indicates that a healthy lower-level food base exists in the form of plants and prey. If all snakes characteristic of a region are around and doing fine, we can have confidence that a properly functioning habitat is available to support them. Whatever other problems might beset a habitat, having a robust food web in operation is essential for any environment.

Another point we should consider is that if the snakes are missing, what else might be absent. Are hognose snakes missing because no toads are to be found? Are the toads absent because of an insufficient supply of insects? Has something happened at the lower levels of the food chain, resulting in a problem that is expressed at the top? When something goes wrong at the bottom of a food chain, an environmental domino effect can result that may not be apparent by simply looking at the landscape.

The revelation that a rich biodiversity of native snakes exists in a region should be viewed as a positive sign. You may not be fond of snakes, but when they are not found where they are supposed to be you may dislike the deeper-lying environmental problems even more. With the arrival of spring, snakes will be out and about for months. Although a few are venomous, snakes are overhyped as a threat to humans.

My hoot of the day is AOC and Bernie Sanders have teamed up for a new green housing deal. I explain where we are and what's on deck.

Common Dreams is out with another economically insane idea. Please consider AOC, Sanders Renew Fight for Green New Deal for Public Housing.

Backed by dozens of progressive groups and congressional Democrats, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday reintroduced legislation designed to tackle both the affordable housing crisis and the climate emergency.

The New York Democrat and Vermont Independent are leading the renewed fight for the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, which would invest up to $234 billion over a decade into ""weatherizing, electrifying, and modernizing our public housing so that it may serve as a model of efficiency, sustainability, and resiliency for the rest of the nation.""

Joining the pair in backing the bill are 55 other House Democrats and Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).

Markey, who has spearheaded the broader battle for a Green New Deal with Ocasio-Cortez, said that ""in the five years since its introduction, Green New Deal advocacy has catapulted environmental justice to the top of the national agenda, helped deliver historic victories, and charted a course for a better future.""

AOC says the bill would invest up to $234 billion over a decade into ""weatherizing, electrifying, and modernizing our public housing"".

The real goal is everyone has a right to affordable housing.

Don't kid yourself, the whole policy would cost many trillions of dollars of which $234 billion is not even a down payment.

Once you issue guarantees with government involved costs soar out of sight.

Even most Democrats recognize this. The bill is so idiotic that it only gathered support 7 Senate advocates and 42 House advocates.

Faircloth Amendment

The real threat is not that the above insanity passes in one fell swoop, but that its starts with a repeal of the Faircloth Amendment, which limits the construction of new public housing developments.

The Faircloth Amendment was a provision of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. It amended the Housing Act of 1937, which authorized federal financial assistance to help states and housing authorities provide housing for low-income people. The amendment says, ""a public housing agency may not use any of the amounts allocated for the agency from the Capital Fund or Operating Fund for the purpose of constructing any public housing unit, if such construction would result in a net increase from the number of public housing units owned, assisted, or operated by the public housing agency on October 1, 1999, including any public housing units demolished as part of any revitalization effort."" In other words, the amendment prevents housing authorities from ever maintaining more public housing units than they had in 1999.

The amendment was named for its sponsor, Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth, a successful hog farmer from South Carolina who served one term in the Senate, from 1993-1999.

The Faircloth Amendment, and the rest of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act, were enacted amid a broader movement for welfare reform that was pushed by Congressional Republicans and co-signed by the Clinton White House in the 1990s. The movement was grounded in a belief that public assistance programs were detrimental to people's ability to achieve economic independence, and that welfare recipients themselves were either overly dependent on the government or outright abusers of taxpayer money. Most lawmakers saw public housing complexes as crime-infested, unhealthy places that kept people trapped in poverty. Running against Clinton in 1996, former Republican Senator Bob Dole, said that public housing was ""one of the last bastions of socialism in the world,"" and called for its elimination.

""It was essentially viewed as a failed program,"" says Susan J. Popkin, director of the Urban Institute's Housing Opportunities and Services Together (HOST) Initiative and author of a series of books about public housing in Chicago and around the country.

Since the 1980s, the restriction of federal funding has had a much bigger impact on public housing than the Faircloth Amendment. The National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates that the U.S. loses around 10,000 public-housing units a year to demolition or disposition because of accumulated maintenance issues.

As Jenny Schuetz argued in her recent post on the Brookings Institution website, the Faircloth Amendment is only a paper obstacle to an expansion of public housing. Other obstacles include the availability of land zoning rules that prevent the development of any new housing in many areas, and existing housing authorities' relative ineffectiveness as real estate developers, she wrote.

But the biggest challenge to expanding public housing is a lack of federal funding. The Green New Deal for Public Housing, a proposal introduced in Congress in 2019 by Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, calls for the federal government to spend $180 billion repairing and retrofitting every existing public housing unit in the U.S. Restoring the 200,000 public-housing units that have been lost would require billions in federal spending and an abrupt departure from the trend of pulling away from publicly owned housing, even without repealing the Faircloth Amendment. Politically, though, repealing the amendment could be powerfully symbolic. As Ross Barkan wrote in the New York Times, ""repeal would be a vital signal that America is back in the business of expanding public housing.""

Urban Institute Research

The Faircloth Amendment is one the best amendments in history. Thank you Senator Lauch Faircloth!

Yet, the amendment is somewhat symbolic.

According to research from the Urban Institute, there were 2,156,625 people living in 1,067,387 public housing units as of 2016, and Popkin says the U.S. has around 200,000 fewer public-housing units than it did in the mid-1990s. Many housing authorities have un-funded maintenance and rehabilitation needs, including the New York City Housing Authority, which needs to spend an estimated $45.2 billion in the next twenty years just to keep its existing units habitable.

The Philadelphia Housing Authority is limited to 20,133 units but only owns around 14,000 units. The Chicago Housing Authority is limited to 35,453 units but maintains fewer than 21,000. The Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta owns 3,500 units out of an allowed 11,965.

Government is the Problem

We do not need the government back in the public housing business. The costs of government programs soars out of sight.

New York with its damn rent control legislation needs to spend $45.2 billion in the next twenty years just to keep its existing units habitable.

Let New York and Chicago fix their own self-made problems. Federal and sate governments are the problem, not the solution to any alleged housing crisis.

One that the wing is very familiar with.

""He's got a motor, he's got energy,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said of Green on Saturday. ""I talked to him about this; he's just got to be ready to go out and play, do what he does.""

That also doesn't mean that Green was promised a certain number of minutes or any playing time at all. The Bulls signed him to a 10-day contract as a hardship exception because of all the injuries they've been dealing with, and because there's a certain amount of familiarity they have with Green, who was a Bull for the previous three seasons.

""Just be myself,"" Green told reporters of getting his latest opportunity. ""Obviously, the Bulls know what I bring to the table.""

That they do, as Green played 113 games with them after he was acquired from Boston in that 2020-21 season, including 46 starts.

He suffered a knee injury last year, however, and it took a much longer time to recover than first thought. That's why he found himself without a team in free agency, eventually ending up with the Santa Cruz Warriors in the G-League.

Green did come to the game between the Bulls and Warriors earlier this month, surprising his former teammates afterward in the locker room, and now he'll no longer have to make unannounced visits.

""Having another body with some of the things we've had to deal with, especially at that wing spot, just to bring him in,"" Donovan said of the move. ""Obviously, he was coming off dealing with his knee last summer and the familiarity piece with the players, with the staff. Things have changed some, but he'll be able to pick those things up. I trust his energy as far as throwing him in there.

""Like I told him, it's not a situation where I carved out a role for him. He just needs to be ready when an opportunity calls.""

The Bulls haven't had the best of luck with injured feet and walking boots this season, already losing Zach LaVine and Patrick Williams to surgeries.

Now, they find themselves playing the guessing game with rookie Julian Phillips, who was still in a walking boot with a sprained right foot.

He was expected to be re-evaluated soon, but with no promises.

""A lot of it is going to be where the pain level is at,"" Donovan said. ""He's been in a boot to take away some of the discomfort. I think that's kind of gone away. From where it was it's gotten better, but we're not going to know anything until he can actually get back on the floor and see what happens with him physically. There's still some uncertainty on OK, how does he respond once he gets out of the boot? Does he have setbacks? We don't know that.""

Phillips has played in 40 games this season, getting just over eight minutes per game.

With the Bulls still playing short-handed and Jevon Carter barely getting playing time, second-year guard Dalen Terry has seen his minutes continue to get a bump.

Terry started the month playing single-digit minutes the first four games, but since then played 13 against the Clippers, 19 against the Wizards, 15 against Portland and then 17 in Houston. He saw 10 minutes in the first half against Boston.",chicago.suntimes.com,news,Chicago Sun-Times,,0.1294117647058823,448940423,1,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a85e1ad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3460x1975+0+166/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2Fbe%2F759119d586e1313a7c7224f39ce3%2F7c45-x192-440f-7.jpg,eng-9421004

Communicating the health risks of climate change and the health benefits of climate solutions is both necessary and helpful. To support this, the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with partners is launching a new toolkit designed to equip health and care workers with the knowledge and confidence to effectively communicate about climate change and health.

The toolkit provides comprehensive resources to help health professionals understand the health impacts of climate change, as well as health co-benefits of climate action, build confidence in communication, and engage with various stakeholders effectively. By empowering health and care workers to communicate about climate change and health, it aims to drive collective action towards mitigating climate change, building resilience and safeguarding public health.

The communications toolkit was developed by WHO in collaboration with Health Canada, the Global Climate and Health Alliance, George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, Climate and Health Alliance Australia, and the Canadian Medical Association.

He affirmed that India will not skirt this problem anymore and the mood in the country is not to overlook the issue of terrorism.

The EAM, who is in Singapore as part of his three-nation visit, was speaking at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore on his book 'Why Bharat Matters'.

Speaking at the event, Jaishankar said, ""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...we have been unfortunate, or ill-starred to be blessed with the one we have to our west. How do you deal with a neighbour, who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""Taking a veiled dig at Pakistan, the EAM said that in the country, terrorism exists almost at ""industry level"" and ""assembly line"".

""It's not a one-off, different countries at different points of time have experienced this. But, a very sustained, almost an industry level, assembly line...people whose job is to do bad things at night,"" he said.

Jaishankar added that India has decided that it will have to find a way to address the problem because dodging it will only invite more trouble.

""I don't have a quick, instantaneous fix, but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore...if we have a problem, we must be honest enough to face up to the problem. If you have to have those discussions, we should, if it's hard to find a solution, we must work through. We should not give the other country free pass...in India the mood is not to overlook terrorism,"" the EAM said.

""If you look at the changes that have happened in the last decade, the great deal of public anger to lack of response to terrorism threat is one factor,"" he added.

Jaishankar is on an official visit to Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia from March 23-27.

The visit will focus on enhancing bilateral relations with the three countries, and would provide an opportunity for engagement on regional issues of mutual concern, a Ministry of External Affairs release said earlier.

This is according to a report compiled by Sounds of the South (SOTS).

The inaugural report looks to set a standard for a continued discussion on the industry's economics, which should be done annually.

The report showcases the real rand value of the licensing activities of collective management organisations and for the first time ever, quantifies the economic impact of these organisations collectively.

SOTS, which is an African Music Business curation collective, released this first-of-its-kind report last week. The report unpacks the total economic impact of the South African music industry.

One of the key outcomes of the report is a financial assessment of the licensing activities of CMOs. Globally, these organisations are known to be responsible for monitoring, licensing, and collecting performance and mechanical rights for their clients.

They also enforce the conditions of each licensing contract and collect and distribute any subsequent royalties.

Such organisations play a crucial role in the functioning of the South African music industry.

The work they undertake to monetise the use of music had, until now, never been assessed holistically.

In Zimbabwe, regulations were put in place in recent years in an effort to expand the local music industry.

While there are more than a dozen CMOs in the South African music industry, locally the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) is the only regulator mandated to protect the rights of musicians under the copyright law, they also collect royalties on their behalf.

However, it must be noted that there is a significant lack of knowledge about copyright law and protection in the country.

The report is a detailed look at how much revenue was generated by various South African music industry organisations.

Some key takeaways from the report show that, traditional (non-streaming) sources of publishing revenue account for 75% of all revenue generated.

Despite global collections falling by around 9.9% in 2020, South African CMOs still managed to collectively collect just under R900 million in royalties during the FY 2020 year of assessment.

SOT spokesperson Phil Chard told Standard Style that foregrounding such information was critical for an ongoing assessment of how well the music industry is doing as well as looking at what else can be done to improve processes within the industry.

""The study was motivated by the need for data,"" Chard said.

""In recent years we've seen the explosion of the African Music market and investment from various stakeholders.

""It is important that everyone in the entertainment industry's value chain is making data-driven decisions that encourage further investment, which will then lead to growth.

""We feel such reports have been difficult to undertake in the past because of a lack of easily accessible, transparent and accessible data.

""Even within this report, not all the necessary data was easily available.""",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Khumbulani Muleya,0.1215686274509804,448940225,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/thestandard/uploads/2022/10/QEzDAnkf8mwxJioITqgvzG80s6bDjuQoahxzh2BZ.jpg,

""Spanish people do not give up going out during Holy Week,"" says José Luis Yzuel, president of Hospitality of Spain. Based on the growth forecasts for the tourism and hospitality sector for the Easter season that began this weekend, he is not wrong. His own employers estimate business growth of 10% compared to the same period last year, which was already a record, above pre-pandemic data.

More occupancy and, therefore, more need for staff, which could mean more risk of encountering unfilled vacancies. However, it is not the case. The Infojobs job portal shows that in February, at the gates of Easter, the number of unfilled job vacancies remains at 16,704, which is 11% less than in the same month of 2023. On the other hand, where They find ""the biggest problem is incorporating trained people"" into the workforce of these tourism and hospitality companies.

This dilemma occurs in a sector that is at maximum occupancy. In fact, tourism employment has not fallen below 2.5 million jobs since March 2023, a record number. In the month of February alone they grew by 4.9%, according to Turespaña. ""Pre-pandemic records will be improved. 2023 was already a record year and this year the upward trend will continue,"" says Mónica Pérez, director of studies at InfoJobs.

The work context has changed towards greater stability and less difficulty in filling positions. As Infojobs itself explains, two factors must be taken into account in this decline: ""the first half of 2023 was marked by the general upward trend in employment and by the impact of the labor reform on the distribution of contracts."" Those that are permanent now represent 40% of the tourism sector, compared to the 27% they represented in 2021. And the use of discontinuous permanent contracts has skyrocketed, which were 1% three years ago and now represent 24% of the hirings.

""There is an offer, in the hospitality industry we are going to incorporate 200,000 people for the season from Easter until the end of summer,"" says Yzuel. But it is less burdensome to cover this offer than it was in the post-pandemic years. The remaining vacancies are, as the president assumes, for very specific positions, partial contracts or seasonal jobs.

""Our staff is very stable throughout the year, derived from the combination of urban and island hotels, where occupancy is maintained throughout the year,"" says the Hesperia hotel company. Meliá and Barceló estimate that they will hire around 1,500-2,000 people, ""in line with last year,"" they point out at Barceló, also marking this trend towards stability.

""Right now, in a growth environment, one of the main risks is talent management,"" says José Manuel Fernández Terán, partner responsible for the tourism sector at PwC.

The hotel company Hotusa states along the same lines: ""We consider that the main challenge in the sector is the attraction and retention of talent. From the group, we believe that it is necessary to promote internal training and promotion, as well as work on new educational models such as dual training to attract and train committed and specialized personnel.""

""The situation has improved, without a doubt, but we still have to correct the partiality of the contracts and ensure that the days are not extended more than stipulated,"" claims Gonzalo Fuentes, head of hospitality and tourism at CC.OO. ""Now that we are growing, it is time to invest in training and in building employee loyalty, giving them a journey in the company so that workers see that they have a professional future,"" says Omar Rodríguez, head of the hospitality and tourism sector at UGT. Fuentes, from CC.OO., adds that training ""cannot be seen as an expense but as an investment, it has to be part of the day for it to really work.""",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.1058823529411765,448940108,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_9d7dc.png,

New renewable companies face a complex year after having revolutionized the Spanish energy board. The rising interest rates of the last twelve months have had a negative impact on these companies, which tend to work with high leverage. On the other hand, electricity prices have shown significant volatility due to weather conditions, which could discourage investors. Although this scenario also impacts large energy groups, it is the dozens of companies that have flourished in the last 20 years that are facing a stage of resistance towards maturity. Most of them maintain their investment plans.

The best reflection of this complex situation are listed companies. Solaria, one of the great leaders in the sector and which is part of the Ibex-35, has lost 40% so far this year. The poor stock market performance contrasts with very positive results, with a record profit of 107 million euros. The company promoted by the Díaz-Tejeiro family currently has an installed capacity of 2.7 GW (gigawatts) in solar generation and continues to invest to reach a capacity of 18 GW.

Acciona Energía, a subsidiary of the construction group led by José Manuel Entrecanales, has also left more than 26% on the stock market, although in this case the 2023 results were lower than the previous year. Grenergy (-28%), Soltec (-35%) or Ecoener (-16%) also registered falls. The exception is Opdernegy, which in recent months its price has been affected by a public acquisition offer (takeover bid) launched by the Antin fund and which concluded this week with almost 100% acceptance by shareholders.

Outside of the trading floor, there are several companies that have become leaders in the sector. This is the case of Forestalia, promoted by the Samper family, it has a capacity of 2 GW of photovoltaic, wind and biomass generation installations. The Aragonese company, which became one of the main winners of the electricity auctions organized by the Government (2016, 2017, 2021 and 2022), has projects with a capacity of 8 GW in its portfolio.

For its part, Capital Energy, led by Jesús Martín Buezas, maintains its investment plans this year despite the complexities of the environment. The Madrid company has a portfolio of wind and solar projects of more than 35 GW. X-Elio, owned by the Brookfield fund, is not intimidated by the situation either and has recently taken another step in its internationalization with its entry into Germany. Elawan, Eolia, Norvento and Greenalia, among others, have already announced new investments in the first quarter.

Another market to take into account is that of self-consumption. With prices skyrocketing in 2021 and 2022, dozens of companies with a model closer to that of the start-up jumped into this market to get their share of the pie from the large energy groups. These are companies such as SolarProfit, Holaluz, Greening, Alterna Energía, Enerside, EDiF, Energy Solar or Quantica.

This exponential growth has also had its cons. EiDF is trying to regain credibility after last summer the CNMV accused the company of not providing complete information to the market and of making ""very relevant omissions."" A few months later, SolarProfit announced an ERE for 30% of the workforce, while HolaLuz announced 200 layoffs in November. The sector is readjusting.

In the field of marketing, small companies occupy a market share of around 10%, between the free market and the regulated market. After the setback suffered during the energy crisis, which involved the disappearance of several firms such as Aura Energía, Voltico or EnercoLuz, several companies have registered increases in new registrations in the data for the third quarter of 2023 offered by the CNMC. Among the main companies, Fenie Energía stands out (with a market share of 1.2%), the CHC Group (1%), Holaluz (0.7%), Factor Energía (0.6%) and Audax Renovables (0 ,5%).",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.3019607843137255,448940085,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_4231e.png,

Many companies are aggressively promoting green skills and talent as well.

A 2024 Capgemini report on global investment trends suggests over 52% of organisations are expected to increase their investments in sustainability in the next two years.

Said Sunil Chemmankotil, CEO, Teamlease Digital, which offers specialised staffing and solutions, ""Sustainability and green initiatives have become top priorities across sectors, leading to consistent growth in green industries and a rising demand for skilled professionals. The employment outlook in these sectors is optimistic, with a potential for India to generate 35 million green jobs by 2047.""

The TeamLease Digital's Green Industry Outlook report found that between 2022 and 2023, the share of green talent in the workforce rose by 12.3%, while job postings requiring at least one green skill rose by 22.4%. The rising demand for green jobs saw cities like Delhi-NCR with year-on-year (YoY) growth of 289%, Mumbai (216%) and Bengaluru (174%) driving the change.

As per Vaishali Nigam Sinha, co-founder and chairperson, sustainability, ReNew, a renewable energy company, ""Some examples like engineering and technical skills can be employed in eco-building, renewable energy design, and energy-saving R&D projects. Science skills, which are in high demand, are being enlisted during the early stages of the value chains and in the utility sector. Operation management along with monitoring skills for firms operating in polluting sectors are some other instances where green skills can be utilised to a great effect. With companies increasingly transitioning to clean energy, the need for developing these skills and nurturing talent is critical. As governments and businesses around the world race to meet their climate goals, recruiting talent equipped with green skills will be the need of the hour.""

The LinkedIn Global Green Skills Report 2023 suggested a shift to green skills and jobs is underway on the platform, based on the activity of more than 930 million LinkedIn users worldwide. The share of green talent increased from 9.6% in 2015, to 13.3% in 2021 (a growth rate of 38.5%). The LinkedIn 2023 Global Green Skills Report shows that the share of green talent across 48 countries grew by an average of 12.3% between 2022 and 2023, but the proportion of job postings requiring at least one green skill was up by 22.4%.

In green sectors, the TeamLease report showed optimistic findings, with the potential to create 35 million green jobs by 2047, doubling the current count of 18.52 million green jobs in India. A significant driver of this growth is the gig workforce in green jobs, which saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2%, surging from 2.9 million in 2022-2023 to an anticipated 7.05 million by 2029-2030.

Aluminium producer Vedanta Aluminium is committed to achieve net zero by 2050, adopting a two-fold strategy of reducing and offsetting carbon footprint. For the brand, green skills take on several forms, ranging from engineering and science skills to operations and analytics.

""Given the vast scope of business, the prospect of deploying personnel with such skill sets is extensive as they can contribute in several areas towards reducing environmental impact -- be it by building future-ready power plants, developing energy-efficient tech, decarbonising value chains or augmenting efforts to produce green metal. We have unveiled an EV policy that provides incentives to encourage adoption of electric vehicles among employees, bringing a sustainable approach into their daily commutes,"" said John Slaven, CEO, Vedanta Aluminium.

In the logistics sector, DHL Express is collaborating with partners for sustainable aviation fuels like e-fuels, exploring technologies like electric and hybrid-electric planes for short-haul routes, and piloting electric vehicles. ""We have set a target to electrify 60% of last-mile vehicles globally and grow sustainable fuel share in line haul to over 30% by 2030.

The Digital Economy En­hancement Project (DEEP) ($78 million) will support the expan­sion of digitally enabled public services delivery for citizens and firms, while the second ad­ditional financing for the Sindh Barrages Improvement Project (SBIP) ($71.7 million) will sup­port better resilience to floods and improvements in the reli­ability, safety, and management of the three Sindh barrages.

""The catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan in 2022 were a tragic reminder of the impor­tance to build resilience to such disasters, including by strength­ening barrages and their man­agement,"" said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan. Also, supporting the growing digital economy in Pakistan is key for economic and social development, broadening connectivity and access to gov­ernment and financial services for citizens and entrepreneurs, particularly women.

The Digital Economy Enhance­ment Project (DEEP) will develop digital authentication and data-sharing platforms to enable Paki­stan to respond more effectively and efficiently to shocks, deliver better e-government services to citizens and firms, and support regulatory reforms in the sector, including to enable greater pri­vate participation, and strength­ening personal data protection and online safety. The project will also promote financial inclusion by enabling women in particu­lar, to open bank accounts or ap­ply remotely for credit through a smartphone application. It will also contribute to addressing barriers such as limited mobility and digital literacy.

""The digital economy and de­mand for digital government services have been growing across the country, increasing the need for connectivity, digi­tal payments, and secure and trusted digital transactions. The project takes a whole-of-government approach to digital transformation and will help ensure that digital platforms are inclusive and trusted,"" said Shan Rehman, Task Team Lead­er for the project.

The second additional financ­ing for the Sindh Barrages Im­provement Project (SBIP) will support the full completion and commissioning of the Guddu and Sukkur barrages rehabili­tation works and improve the management of three barrages in Sindh including Guddu, Suk­kur and Kotri. Having safe and effective barrages to convey flood-waters downstream is a crucial part of building climate resilience in Sindh. The addi­tional financing will also con­tribute to strengthening the provincial Barrage Management Unit's technical capacities, pro­moting women's participation in emergency preparedness, and implementing extensive citizen engagement and stake­holder participation. ""Barrages such as the ones supported by SBIP are critical for the liveli­hoods and climate-resilience of the Sindh province,"" said Fran­cois Onimus, Task Team Leader for the project.

Fronting a crowd at AUT's Manukau South Campus this afternoon, the former Prime Minister used his first major speech as Opposition leader to attack the Government's new policy shifts, while pushing his own party values.

Hipkins particularly took aim at National's accounting and an alleged multi-billion dollar hole (Finance Minister Nicola Willis denies the shortfall), telling the audience the Government now couldn't deliver on its fiscal pledges.

""Let me be absolutely clear. The financial crisis the current Government claim to have inherited is one they have created for themselves.""

Hipkins said National's plan to slash spending on public services to fund its promised tax cuts would leave Kiwis worse off, describing public sector redundancies as a ""ruthless attack"".

""It is so easy to brand public servants as faceless bureaucrats, but they are people,"" he said.

""They are people with families, mortgages and they work tirelessly. National is rewarding that hard work with redundancy and an uncertain future.""

Hipkins told the audience the Government's lower spending goal ""simply means they take from the many to give to the few - and life will only get worse for most people"".

On tax, he argued the current system was ""inequitable"" and ""unsustainable"".

""We have one of the least diversified tax systems in the world, meaning public investment into things like health, education, welfare, housing and infrastructure is more reliant on income tax than most other countries we compare ourselves to,"" Hipkins said.

""In other words, those who earn their living through their salary and wages are contributing a greater share than those who earn income through wealth.

""Under this Government, those with multiple investment properties are getting huge tax breaks, while those on salary and wages pay tax on every dollar they earn.""

Labour would shortly be releasing a series of discussion documents on key issues, including tax, Hipkins said.

""When the 2026 general election rolls around, we will be more prepared for government than any opposition in our country's history.""

Today's address follows a tumultuous week in politics, in which Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was again forced to field questions about coalition partner Winston Peters, after the NZ First leader compared elements of race issues in New Zealand to Nazi Germany.

Municipal energy supplier Westfalen Weser has announced plans to develop a 120 MW/280 MWh battery energy storage system at a former nuclear power plant site in Würgassen, North Rhine-Westphalia. As the utility said this week, the town of Beverungen has handed over the land to Westfalen Weser.

The 1,912 MW Würgassen nuclear power plant was operated by PreussenElektra, both prior to and during decommissioning. Commercial operations began in 1975. The plant was shut down in 1994, after which all fuel elements were removed.

Just like decommissioned coal power plants, retired nuclear reactors are attractive locations for the development of grid-scale battery energy storage systems. They offer the opportunity to reuse existing infrastructure and grid interconnection rights.

Westfalen Weser has confirmed this, saying that the retired Würgassen plant is particularly suitable for a battery storage facility because it has the needed infrastructure in place, including a transformer station and corresponding lines. The facility is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2026, with investments totaling around €92 million ($99.6 million).

Around the world, more than 2 billion people lack access to safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene services, with conflicts and climate change exacerbating the issue.

Unsafe and insufficient WASH facilities, especially in rural and remote areas, can lead to increased health complications for older people, persons with disabilities and children. They also reinforce cycles of poverty, inequality and deprivation - particularly for women, children and marginalized groups, who are disproportionately impacted by a lack of equitable access to water and sanitation.

Launched on World Water Day, the guidelines address the knowledge gap on ways to practically implement inclusive approaches to WASH infrastructure development, particularly in developing countries and fragile contexts.

Climate change, conflicts and water pollution are widening the gap to ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, especially for women and marginalized groups. Making sure that WASH infrastructure and services are inclusive is the only way to close the gap and leave no one behind.

Samantha Stratton-Short - UNOPS Head of Strategic Initiatives

Acknowledging how the triple planetary crisis, conflicts and pandemics impact access to WASH services, the guidelines propose approaches that consider sustainability, resilience and inclusion. It further highlights that inclusive WASH infrastructure can only be developed through a participatory and integrated approach. This entails:

""The ILO recognizes that access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is key to meeting basic human needs. It directly impacts on health and well-being, and affects people's ability to engage in meaningful and productive activities,"" said Mito Tsukamoto, Branch Chief, Employment in Investments, for ILO's Employment Policy, Jobs Creation and Livelihoods Department.

Drawing on project case studies from Bangladesh, Malawi, Nepal and more, the guidelines illustrate the diverse challenges faced by different groups, and provide recommended actions and resources to strengthen the capacity of governments, infrastructure practitioners and other stakeholders to address these.

""We are proud to work with UNOPS on their approach to changing the way we plan, design, manage and commission inclusive WASH infrastructure for all,"" said Mark Fletcher, Global Water Business Leader at Arup.

""This approach overcomes the systemic barriers that diverse social groups face and helps accelerate climate action together,"" he added.

Capitalism Can't Solve Climate Change

BY BRETT CHRISTOPHERS

MARCH 20, 2024 9:00 AM EDT

Christophers is professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, and author The Price Is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won't Save the Planet and Our Lives in Their Portfolios: Why Asset Managers Own the World

...

Veiled by discussion of headline global trends in new renewables capacity investment is the fact that almost all the incremental progress is currently being made in one country: China. ...

...

While China surges ahead, the rest of the world remains stuck.

This raises a crucial question. What is different about the development of solar and wind resources in China from the rest of the world?

The main answer is that in China, such development is capitalist in only a very limited sense. Certainly, the entities centrally involved in building out new solar and wind farms in China are companies. But almost all are state-owned. Take wind. Nine of the country's top 10 wind developers are owned by the government, and such state-owned players control in excess of 95 percent of the market.

...

Add to this the fact that the banks financing all the new renewables development in China are generally also state-owned and directed, and a stark reality comes into focus. This is essentially central planning in action.

...

Why are renewables returns so low? Numerous factors conspire to drive down profits, but one is particularly important: competition. ... There is no OPEC-like cartel in renewable electricity.

...

The alternative? To face a growing risk of climate catastrophe.

The reality is Chinese central planners have made a colossal mess of their economy, because of their incompetence, economic mismanagement and Covid lockdowns. For at least 30 years the Chinese Government has been keeping interest rates too low to encourage development, but the result has been enormous resource misallocation and huge asset bubbles. The Chinese realestate bubble has popped, creating a catastrophic mess of bad loans in their realestate sector. Even worse, Chinese regional governments have for years been creating fake economic growth to meet central targets by issuing government bonds, and many are now likely bankrupt.

One day soon Chinese people will realise most of their investment savings have been lost by incompetent and corrupt bank managers and government officials, or even worse, that their savings are still in the bank, but have lost all their value. There have already been minor bank runs and collapses, though so far the Chinese government has somehow contained the situation, my guess is by printing more money to rehydrate the failed banks.

And of course there is the other side of China's energy policy which Professor Brett Christophers conveniently ignores - China's massive investment in new coal capacity.

China is not a model to copy. At least Professor Brett Christophers admitted renewables are unprofitable, but Chinese government officials directing banks to invest in unprofitable renewables is not helping China's beleaguered banks to balance their books, and has almost certainly exacerbated the Chinese Communist economic crisis.

Professor Brett Christophers is right that the free market has not produced the climate outcomes he wants, but this is because the free market is driven by demand. People just don't want expensive unreliable energy. The communist part of our economies, government subsidies for green energy and other boondoggles, is not something to be admired, it is something to be excised, like the political tumor it is.

No jockey has had more BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) success in the past decade than Hugh Bowman and on Sunday the Australian gets a golden opportunity to bank his third victory in the city’s most prestigious race.

With victory aboard Helios Express, Bowman – who was successful with Werther in 2016 and Furore in 2019 – would join Joao Moreira (Rapper Dragon) and Vincent Ho Chak-yiu (Golden Sixty) as the only riders to orchestrate a Classic Series clean sweep.

The John Size-trained Helios Express enters his date with destiny with a slight cloud over his head after a recent hoof infection, but the vets have given the star four-year-old the tick of approval and Bowman is confident nothing will be left to chance.

“I’m not concerned about where he’s at and I’m confident John will have him where he needs to be,” said Bowman of the galloper he has partnered to Classic Mile and Classic Cup successes already this season. “If we can get a nice, smooth run he ought to make his presence felt.”

The other question mark is Helios Express’ gate, with the son of Toronado likely to find himself near the back of the field from gate 13 in a contest that could well be slowly run.

“It’s important that he relaxes. He needs to relax to run the distance so we’ll have to ride a conservative race,” Bowman said.

“It’ll depend on other people’s decisions as to how far back we go, but we’ll just get him to settle whether he’s midfield or further back. There’s not that much I can do about it.

“He’s got the class but we don’t want to undo it in the first half, we’ve got to ensure we’ve got some energy left for the business end.”

Shinn snared the prestigious two-year-old feature aboard Lady Of Camelot on his way to a treble and will look to continue his white-hot form aboard Derby wild card Galaxy Patch.

“My job is to try to get him to relax for the first part of the race and I would say that arguably he’s got the best turn of foot in the race,” Shinn said of Galaxy Patch, who steps out over further than 1,400m for the first time and must contend with barrier 14.Yung family’s rich HK Derby history just one of many layers to Sunday’s feature

The Hawke's Bay Regional Transport Committee unveiled a draft regional land transport plan this week to restore and improve the province's roading network, among other initiatives.

All up, the plan would cost $5.5 billion.

Most of that - $4.6b - is earmarked for multi-year projects across the state highway network, which would include the expanded expressway.

Then there's an anticipated $888 million for local roads.

""Transport system investments are complex, but are essentially a partnership,"" the committee said in a summary document.

""Councils and NZTA, as the road controlling authority, put their transport system investments in the [regional transport plan].

""If accepted, these will then form part of the national land transport plan and secure co-funding from the national land transport fund. The remainder of the investment comes from a local source, usually council rates.""

The fund is derived from fuel excise duty, road user charges and motor vehicle registration.

Rather than a rates rise, Act Party leader David Seymour favours the idea of tolls.

Seymour, the Minister of Regulation in the Government, laments the general lack of collaboration between the crown and councils across New Zealand on the issue of infrastructure.

Hawke's Bay is a region where there's currently cohesion, as the Cyclone Gabrielle rebuild gathers momentum.

That does come at a cost, though, and significant council rate rises are forecast.

Seymour's glad Hawke's Bay is likely to get improved infrastructure over the next decade, but dubious that higher rates or petrol prices should be the means of paying for it.

""It's interesting,"" Seymour said, during a visit to Hawke's Bay on Thursday.

""You look at the State Highway 25 repairs in Coromandel, you look at the rebuild of the road in Kaikōura after that earthquake and you look at the amount of housing that's been built surrounding Christchurch in the last 10 years, it seems we almost need a disaster for common sense to kick in.

""Our Government is committed to city and regional partnerships where central government and local government make a long term plan.

""We're committed to revenue sharing where, having agreed what needs to be built, the central government shares more revenue with the local government and we're also committed to finding new ways to fund and finance infrastructure.

""Because basically there's a lot of places in New Zealand where people would choose to pay a toll if they could get somewhere faster, safer, and using less petrol. But, at the moment, that's not even an option.

""I acknowledge that when you have a natural disaster you get some attention, but actually you shouldn't need to have one.""",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,Hamish Bidwell,0.09019607843137245,448938451,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/IF4FDV5ZTFCL7OBQIBP3EAZNC4.JPG?auth=499f9094a6aa8177d47089d4d99c16f2c281facc2ed41a4fb19ccd0fecd99ee0&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,

The EIB's investment is supported by the InvestEU programme, which aims to trigger more than €372 billion in additional investment across Europe until 2027, including in new technologies. In addition, Sunfire secured additional €215million in a Series E equity financing round.

The agreement will support Sunfire develop electrolysers to produce green hydrogen more energy- and cost-effectively for industry processes, replacing the use of fossil fuels in high energy consuming sectors like chemicals and steel. Likely clients would include fertilizer/ammonia or methanol producers, energy majors and steel mills that are seeking to decarbonize their production.

Sunfire, founded in 2010 and based in Dresden, offers a combination of two complementary and differentiated technology platforms. Sunfire's pressurized alkaline electrolysers are already installed on an industrial scale today. It's innovative high-temperature solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC) will be a sought-after option in many applications in the future, because of their higher efficiency.

In the further development of solid oxide electrolysers, Sunfire will seek improvements in stack and module design, implementing new materials and optimizing design, as well as automation and new production techniques, to simplify the production-process.

The EIB loan comes in the form of equity-type venture debt, with a guarantee under the InvestEU's Green Transition window that supports the achievement of the EU's policy objective of decarbonizing the industry. The EIB venture debt loan is a form of finance that meets the needs of fast-growing, innovative companies.

Popular characters from children's literature are painted on the walls, along with a few quotes from books as well as introductions to the authors and illustrators. Children's literature in Bangla itself is quite rich. Could we not implement similar initiatives in our airports or other public places which are visited by children? This would familiarise them with the books and ignite their interest in reading the stories, which will boost their imagination and help their overall development.

Many decision makers conduct a cost-and-benefit analysis of any idea before doing anything else. But, in most cases, money has nothing to do with making spaces child-friendly. At many hospitals in Dhaka, paediatricians work in a particular section of the building. Instead of keeping the news channel on display, alongside distressing images of conflict, could these televisions in children's spaces not show children's programmes instead?

Child-friendly infrastructure, design, and services require little to no cost if we only care to look at things through the eyes of a child. The decision of a restaurant owner to stock separate chairs and food items for children is enough to cater to the needs of the youngest members of our society in a public space. If there is paper and colour pencils or puzzles for children to solve, they can have a fun time while waiting for food while also getting positive stimuli for their development. These facilities should be present not only in restaurants but in all spaces where children have to wait to receive services.

In a number of art galleries in Europe, for instance, I found easy-to-understand descriptions of artworks displayed at a height that is low enough for them to read. Can't we do the same in Bangladesh? More importantly, there should be play areas for children and breastfeeding corners for mothers at bus and railway stations, as well as in airports. Out of the five sinks in a public place, it would be easy and inexpensive to design one sink at a height that children could reach.

Similarly, when organising an event at home or preparing food for a festival, we need to keep children's needs and preferences in mind. Once we realise that infrastructures and services will be used by children as well, the world can be made more accessible for them within existing budgets and capabilities. Even when resources are required, an organisation should be able to manage that if responding to children's needs is a priority.

In terms of making a city child-friendly, the initiative Urban95 by Bernard van Leer Foundation is a good example. The average height of three-year-old children is 95cm, so Urban95 is working globally regarding the kind of changes needed in designing a city from the 95-cm-tall perspective of a child. From Albania's Tirana to Colombia's Bogota, cities are taking steps by keeping children's needs in mind. Ciudad Bolivar is one of the poorest places in Bogota, with a very high crime rate. As such, the local inhabitants are trying to protect children by identifying the areas which pose the highest risk for them.

Taking children's safety into account when building infrastructure, restoring urban greenery, putting emphasis on children's play and creative activities, and making society safer for children are essential. In urban planning, it is important to listen to the voices of children belonging to different age groups and include them in the designing process as this will make our cities more liveable for children. Of course, higher awareness and skills to create child-friendly infrastructure, designs, and services should be a part of the curriculum for urban planners, architects, and designers.

Some time ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts, US. I saw a playground that seemed to have been made for everyone. At one end, there were tables with benches on each side. There was also a dedicated space for children in wheelchairs. The design of the playground had to only be slightly adjusted to ensure that children with disabilities can take part in various sports and games.

I also spoke with some factory workers and volunteers who manufacture various kinds of furniture for children with disabilities about the universal design. They told me how they adapt the design keeping in mind the special needs of each child. The chair a child will sit on and the table where they will study or make art will vary depending on their age and nature of disability. With adaptive furniture, these children have better control over their lives and can live with dignity. Such initiatives should be taken for children with disabilities in Bangladesh as well.

Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq once made an important observation: ""A society does not have to be rich to afford democracy. A family does not have to be wealthy to respect the rights of each member. A nation does not have to be affluent to treat women and men equally. Valuable social and cultural traditions can be -- and are -- maintained at all levels of income.""

We like to say that children are the future of the nation. But are we carrying out our responsibilities to make their present meaningful? It is quite common to see children's playgrounds being taken over by commercial fairs or other purposes. But children must be given priority in all plans. Each of us should work from our respective positions to create a child-friendly society. Only this can ensure that children will grow up to realise their potential to the fullest and in turn contribute to building the nation.

Known for her influential presence in the tech industry, Swisher shared her experiences of being both loved and hated by some of the most powerful individuals in American business during a promotional event in downtown Minneapolis.

Having spent 15 years covering the technology industry at the Wall Street Journal, Swisher made a significant impact by shifting the focus from PC hardware to internet companies like Netscape, Yahoo, and America Online. She emphasized the importance of not just understanding how technology works, but also communicating its impact to a broader audience.

As Swisher's career progressed, she became a respected columnist and co-hosted renowned conferences featuring industry giants like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. However, her optimism about the transformative power of internet companies waned with the rise of social media, leading to concerns about privacy, addiction, and concentrated power.

Swisher has been vocal about the lack of regulation in the tech industry and has praised Senator Amy Klobuchar for her efforts to address antitrust issues. Despite Klobuchar's challenges in combating the influence of tech companies through lobbying and political divisions, Swisher remains hopeful for change.

Rising temperatures have taken a toll on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalayan glaciers, causing them to melt at an alarming rate. As a result, glacial lakes have emerged, shimmering like jewels amidst the rugged terrain.

Risks and recognition

These glacial lakes pose a significant risk of flooding events, capable of unleashing devastation upon the land and its people. Over seven million people live in the shadow of an impending disaster.

Recognising the urgency of the situation, the Government of Pakistan, with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), is implementing a comprehensive project to mitigate the risks posed by these glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), helping communities preserve indigenous practices such as glacier grafting, avalanche harvesting, and ice stupas for water conservation in the valleys of the north. The goal is twofold: to safeguard local communities and provide early warnings of potentially catastrophic flood events.

A comprehensive plan of early warning systems

By the end of 2024, the Government of Pakistan aims to construct 250 engineering structures strategically placed throughout the affected regions. They include gabion walls, check dams, and irrigation channels, all designed to divert and manage the immense volumes of water that threaten to engulf both life and land. To date, the construction of 172 irrigation channels and 230 small-scale infrastructures are complete, which are benefitting up to 157,259 people, 51 per cent of which are women and girls.

In addition to the construction of hydraulic structures, the project is investing in the development of robust disaster management policies. To date, federal and provincial institutions have been supported, including communities in 24 of the most vulnerable valleys in Northern Pakistan. They will now establish a framework for effective response and coordination in times of crisis.

Meanwhile, weather monitoring stations will vigilantly monitor the ever-changing climate, while flood gauges will provide crucial data on water levels. Hydrological modelling will allow experts to anticipate flood scenarios with greater accuracy. So far, two automatic weather stations and 14 gauges/sensors have been installed in Gilgit Baltistan, benefitting 13,687 people.

However, perhaps the most vital component of this comprehensive plan lies in the implementation of early warning systems. These systems will act as guardians by providing life saving time for evacuation and preparation. They will tirelessly monitor the glacial lakes and their surrounding environment and sound the alarm at the first sign of danger.

Community resilience

The effects of climate change on people's livelihoods are tremendous. Through their collective efforts, the communities can turn the tide against nature's wrath. The lives and livelihoods of millions depend on their unwavering commitment and expertise.

""Now that the installation of the early warning systems is underway in our valley, we feel far safer than before, as we do not have to migrate to other places in fear of a glacial lake outburst flood or any other climate disasters. We can stay on our land and adapt to nature. The warning mechanisms set in place will alert us before a disaster strikes, and we will be able to prepare and protect ourselves accordingly.""

Sitara Parveen, a member of the Project's Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committee in the Valley of Ghulkin

A vision for the future

Set to conclude by 2025, the communities will be fully equipped to respond to GLOF events through the established early warning systems and disaster response mechanisms. The Pakistan Meteorological Department will take over the responsibility of operating and maintaining the early warning systems, while other relevant departments will appropriately handle other assets.

The Community-Based Disaster Risk Management Committees and Hazard Watch Groups are fostering ownership and a strong sense of responsibility, further strengthening the project's impact and ensuring a comprehensive and sustainable climate action.

Finally, the project's initiatives will extend beyond the 24 valleys it currently operates in to tackle climate challenges and vulnerabilities exacerbated by global warming in the area, ensuring that no one is left behind.",reliefweb.int,news,ReliefWeb,,-0.1607843137254902,448937740,1,https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/reports/b9/f7/b9f72055-c7ca-4dd0-bf59-45fdb21e4822.jpg,

Several dozen members of California's congressional delegation, including a handful from Southern California, asked Gov. Gavin Newsom last week to prioritize investment in the space industry, part of a move among leaders responding to recent job cuts and funding shortfalls.

In their letter, 40 House members and the state's two senators emphasized the need for greater state leadership and continued investment, which they said will bring to California high-paying jobs and large economic growth.

""With the increased cadence in commercial, national security and civil space launch, there is not a better time to position California to be a global leader in the space economy,"" the lawmakers said.

Because the state is already home to several federal space facilities, including the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Los Angeles Air Force Base, NASA facilities like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center as well as a strong satellite manufacturing industry, lawmakers said: ""California is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing space economy.""

California has a rich heritage of spaceflight, said Madhu Thangavelu, a lecturer of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California. The state, instrumental in landing men on the moon in the space race, is home to offices or headquarters of several industry heavyweights, including Boeing, Northrop Grumman, NASA and SpaceX.

""In the past 10 years, we've seen the private space sector take off,"" said Thangavelu, also a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""This happened the most in Southern California, to be specific.""

""No other state could compete with California because of our heritage,"" he said. ""There's a whole culture around human spaceflight that exists in all of California.""

Since 2019, California has invested $625 million in more than 25 counties in the defense and space industry through various programs, said Newsom spokesperson Omar Rodriguez, including those that offer tax credits to businesses based in the state.

Some examples are California Competes, an income tax credit available to businesses that want to come to California or stay in the state; the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority, which offers a tax exclusion to manufacturers of products that reduce pollution and energy use; and the Employment Training Panel, a workforce training program that provides financial assistance to California businesses, said Rodriguez.

In 2022, California launched the California Space Industry Task Force, aimed at pursuing opportunities to ""harness future growth in the space industry,"" according to Newsom's office, through efforts like expanding aerospace research and working with universities to strengthen their career pipeline into the industry.

The task force convenes government and industry leaders regularly to strengthen commercial space industry in the state, said Rhys Williams, Newsom's chief deputy cabinet secretary.

Despite those efforts, said Thangavelu, companies have uprooted their headquarters or parts of their businesses from California, partly due to the state's heavy regulation of public and private companies as well as the high cost of doing business.

In response to the lawmakers, Williams said Newsom is ""committed to expanding the state's role in our nation's space ecosystem.""

""California's innovation is not limited to Earth,"" he said. ""California looks forward to working with state and federal leaders to continue growing and leading the nation's commercial space sector.""

Many of the lawmakers noted that they were motivated by a desire to preserve space industry jobs within their districts and California as a whole.

It was just last month when JPL in Pasadena laid off more than 500 people, about 8% of the lab's total staffing.

At the time, JPL Director Laurie Leshin, in breaking the news to the staff at JPL, wrote, ""These cuts are among the most challenging that we have had to make even as we have sought to reduce our spending in recent months.""

Leshin noted that the lab was waiting on Congress for funding for the much-publicized Mars Sample Return mission -- an effort to retrieve soil and rock samples collected by a Mars rover and return them to Earth for study. But officials were already under the gun to cut costs, leading to a hiring freeze, a reduction in some MSR mission contracts, budget cuts and elimination of some on-site contractors.

She noted that NASA previously told JPL to expect an MSR budget of $300 million, a 63% drop from the previous year.

When Congress passed last-minute funding bills earlier this month, Sen. Alex Padilla noted that the approved funding agreement that ""provides no less than $300 million in funding for the Mars Sample Return Program"" was ""a step in the right direction"" to ensure California's leading position in the industry.

But it didn't take the matter off local leaders' radars across Southern California.

""The issue is of particular importance to the thousands of aerospace jobs here in the San Fernando Valley,"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks. This point was echoed by fellow San Fernando Valley Rep. Tony Cárdenas of Panorama City.

""Seeing the respective successes of Texas and Florida's space ventures, I joined my California delegation colleagues to encourage Gov. Newsom to further expand efforts in our state,"" said Cárdenas. ""We know that California has valuable resources and talent that could outcompete others, so I'm supportive of state investments in our space industrial.""

And Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat who represents a district that has a wealth of private aerospace companies, said Orange County could benefit from increased state support.

""I'm proud to represent a thriving research community, which includes academic researchers at places like (UC Irvine) and local businesses that are building critical systems for the Artemis Space Program,"" she said, pointing to the NASA campaign that aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the moon.

""Orange County is a nationwide leader in driving innovation, and we have consistently benefited from bipartisan federal support,"" said Porter. ""Our community also needs partners at the state level, who will invest in our growing space economy to promote scientific advances and create jobs.""

A similar group of bipartisan lawmakers -- including Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank; Mike Garcia, R-Santa Clarita; and Judy Chu, D-Pasadena -- recently urged NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to commit at least $650 million to the Mars Sample Return Program.

Chu, along with Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican, have also restarted the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, which works to advance planetary science missions. The Planetary Society is a founding partner of the caucus.

In the letter to Nelson, signed by 23 representatives from California, they asked NASA to invest in the program to retain its workforce and ensure America remains the world leader in the race to Mars.

""If NASA continues to put forward insufficient funding necessitating any further reductions in staff downstream and unnecessary delays to the mission, it risks compromising our national leadership with respect to solar system exploration,"" they said.",dailynews.com,news,Daily News,"Ryan Carter, Clara Harter, Hanna Kang",0.2784313725490195,448937569,1,https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OCR-L-CASPACE-0323.jpg?w=640,

When Lloyds of London formed in 1688, roughly halfway through the Age of Sail, the Industrial Age was still a century away, but the ability to hedge risk when transporting goods accelerated everything. If you've been following the posts here about Peter Zeihan you know that overall we're expecting the U.S. assurance of freedom of the seas, the underpinning of globalization, isn't going to survive much longer. When that becomes the case, the cost of insuring cargo in an area not patrolled by a local hegemon is going to ZOOM.

You can't get a mortgage in the U.S. without proof of insurance. The U.S. insurance industry has been under the gun for a while, with no place worse than Florida. There are two types of beach community property owners; those rich enough to come, and those who are too poor to go. Here in California we're just starting to experience homes in a grove of pine trees at the end of a narrow, winding road becoming throwaways and Colorado is running neck and neck with us.

This is a sober, weighty discussion of what's coming at us. While not as grim as China's 100% overbuild of housing, the combination of climate change, income inequality, and our affordable housing crisis make for a complex, multipolar problem that WILL bite us, it's just a question of when.

I never thought much about insurance until 2007, when I learned what a monoline bond insurer does. We had four of them at the time - Ambac, MBIA, FGIC, and FSA. So much of the financial sector had drunk the derivatives Koolaid and there was a real chance the entire global financial system would go sideways. There was a short period of time where international shipping stalled because bank letters of credit were not trusted(!)

When a bond rating agency marks a bond as anything other than AAA quality that means its no longer ""investment grade"". The terms of insurance change but more importantly institutional holders like pension funds immediately exit, as they're not allowed to hold less than perfect bonds.

There are a lot of things in the steady state ""climate change is a hoax"" world where typical climate change disasters are filed as black swan events. Mother Nature spins everything from fundamental particles to galaxies, but our media spin is irrelevant. Things happen where, when, and how they happen.

One thing that will make the postseason difficult for the Bulls is depth. Chicago has dealt with a lot of injury trouble this season, and to try to soften the blow of those injuries, they just signed Javonte Green to a 10-day contract.

""The Chicago Bulls announced today that the team has signed guard/forward Javonte Green to a 10-day contract,"" A press release from the Bulls said. ""Green, 6-5, 205, rejoins Chicago after appearing in 10 games this season with the Santa Cruz Warriors, the G League affiliate of the Golden State Warriors, where he averaged 12.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 0.7 blocks in 22.0 minutes per game.""

Bulls head coach Billy Donovan talked to the media on Saturday evening before Chicago hosted the Boston Celtics, and he discussed the move.

""...I think having another body with some of the things that we had to deal with, especially at that wing spot [is helpful],"" Billy Donovan told the press. ""Just to bring him in, obviously he was coming off of dealing with his knee [injury] last summer, and I think the familiarity piece, as you mentioned, with the players and the staff and everybody else [is important]. Things have changed some, but he'll be able to pick those things up. I trust his energy in terms of putting him into the game and throwing him in there. It's certainly tough tonight [to find minutes for him] - I'm not opposed to it - but with him just getting in last night and then being at shootaround today. But he's been around, so I think there is a level of comfort that he has just walking in the building where everything isn't completely foreign to him.""

Billy Donovan wants Javonte Green to bring energy

Javonte Green didn't sign a 10-day contract with the Bulls because he's going to come in and be a star. He is coming in to provide depth, and Donovan wants him to be able to provide some energy to the team as well.

""I talked to him about this,"" Donovan continued. ""He just has to be ready to play and go in and do what he does. He's got a motor, he's got energy, and at least last year he was pretty good with that starting unit at times just with the way he played and what he did. But I want him to go out and do what he does well, and that's, I think, bringing energy to the game. So that's, I think, what his role would be. I told him it's not a situation where I've carved out a role for him; I just think he has to be ready when an opportunity is called, to just go out there and bring energy and do what he does.""

With the likes of Anthony Richardson, Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman Jr. on the roster, the Indianapolis Colts have no shortage of star power. But, not all important players are stars, and the Colts also have a plethora of key contributors who don't receive too much national attention. But, just because they're not popping up in headlines all over doesn't mean they aren't appreciated, especially by the fans in Indianapolis.

Sermon is currently penciled in as the second back behind Jonathan Taylor on the depth chart, and that could be his role once the season starts.

Sermon had just 35 attempts for 160 yards last season playing behind both Taylor and Moss. Those numbers will likely increase in 2024.

Trudeau Govt to Investigate 'How Climate Change Interacts With Democratic Decline',"Self-described ""basic Chinese dictatorship"" admirer -- I don't need to play the clip here, right? We've all seen it by now -- and effeminate Xi Jinping boy-toy Justin Trudeau has big new plans for the money his government farms from the serfs.

The Canadian Government will invest C$8.4 million (US$6.1 million) to investigate how climate change affects the decline of democracy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday (20 March).

The Canadian premier delivered the remarks during his virtual participation at the Third Summit for Democracy convened by South Korea.

""Today, I'm announcing that Canada is investing C$8.4 million on research across the global south to better understand how climate change interacts with democratic decline,"" Trudeau said.

The world is confronted to growing insecurity tied to armed conflicts and climate change, Trudeau said. The funding will also assist in preserving the human rights of environmental defenders, he said.

Canada is increasing and expanding its funding for non-profit organization Acces Now in a bid to ensure human rights defenders and others who may face digital threats, have the proper tools to protect themselves, Trudeau added.

He goes on in the same clip to repeat the same tired points about the alleged threat that ""disinformation"" poses to Democracy™, Inclusion™ and ""youth empowerment,"" etc.

Anyway, what precisely is the relationship between atmospheric carbon and popular control over the mechanics of governance?

Does Climate Change™ hurt sacred Democracy™, or does Trumpy-like fascism drive Climate Change™? What's the cause-and-effect chart like here?

Who cares! Shut your mouth bigot, and fork over your check to Mommy Trudeau because The Science™, and because Democracy™.

Obviously, no one, Trudeau included, actually understands what ""research across the global south to better understand how climate change interacts with democratic decline"" entails because it's NGO-speak drivel, but you can be sure some public-private sector entrepreneurs are going to get rich.

If you ask American voters what their top issues are, most will point to kitchen-table issues like the economy, inflation, crime, health care or education.

Fewer than 5% of respondents in 2023 and 2024 Gallup surveys said that climate change was the most important problem facing the country.

Despite this, research that I conducted with my colleagues suggests that concern about climate change has had a significant effect on voters' choices in the past two presidential elections. Climate change opinions may even have had a large enough effect to change the 2020 election outcome in President Joe Biden's favor. This was the conclusion of an analysis of polling data that we published on Jan. 17, through the University of Colorado's Center for Social and Environmental Futures.

What explains these results, and what effect might climate change have on the 2024 election?

We used 2016 and 2020 survey data from the nonpartisan organization Voter Study Group to analyze the relationships between thousands of voters' presidential picks in the past two elections with their demographics and their opinions on 22 issues, including climate change.

The survey asked voters to rate climate change's importance with four options: ""unimportant,"" ""not very important,"" ""somewhat important"" or ""very important.""

In 2020, 67% of voters rated climate change as ""somewhat important"" or ""very important,"" up from 62% in 2016. Of these voters rating climate change as important, 77% supported Biden in 2020, up from 69% who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. This suggests that climate change opinion has been providing the Democrats with a growing electoral advantage.

...

So, if most voters -- even Democrats -- do not rank climate change as their top issue, how could climate change opinion have tipped the 2020 presidential election?

Our analysis could not answer this question directly, but here are three educated guesses:

First, recent presidential elections have been extremely close. This means that climate change opinion would not need to have a very large effect on voting to change election outcomes. In 2020, Biden won Georgia by about 10,000 votes -- 0.2% of the votes cast -- and he won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes, 0.6% of votes cast.

Second, candidates who deny that climate change is real or a problem might turn off some moderate swing voters, even if climate change was not those voters' top issue. The scientific evidence for climate change being real is so strong that if a candidate were to deny the basic science of climate change, some moderate voters might wonder whether to trust that candidate in general.

Third, some voters may be starting to see the connections between climate change and the kitchen-table issues that they consider to be higher priorities than climate change. For example, there is strong evidence that climate change affects health, national security, the economy and immigration patterns in the U.S. and around the world.",climatedepot.com,news,Climate Depot,,0.1450980392156862,448936910,1,,eng-9419445

A new study from the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Trinity College Dublin has explored the effects of stopping universal Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination in Ireland. The study is recently published in the journal Vaccine in time for World TB Day 2024 (24 March ).

BCG remains the only vaccine for prevention of tuberculosis (TB) providing up to 70 % protection from severe disease in children. Ireland had a policy of universal BCG infant vaccination since 1949 but was recommended to change to a selective vaccination programme targeting those at higher risk of infection in 2013. But before a selective programme could be implemented, vaccination was discontinued entirely due to a lack of vaccine supply in 2015. A selective BCG vaccination strategy was published in 2022 but the vaccination programme is not yet operational.

This study retrospectively analysed TB notifications aged 0-6 years old reported to the Irish National TB Surveillance System between 2011 and 2021. Key epidemiological characteristics and temporal trends in TB age specific incidence rates (ASIRs) were compared between 0 and 6 year old cases born during a period of universal BCG vaccination (2007-2015) and 0-6 year old cases born after BCG vaccination ceased (2015-2021).

Overall researchers found the epidemiology of cases in both birth cohorts remained similar. While this study did not find a significant increase in paediatric TB cases aged 0-6 years old, interruption of the previously declining trend in this age group during universal vaccination may be an early warning of a future increase. Modelling studies conducted elsewhere suggest that full effects of moving from universal to selective programmes may take up to 15 years to emerge.

Findings emphasise the need for timely surveillance of paediatric TB cases to monitor for the emergence of increasing trends or emergent risk groups in this mainly unvaccinated population, and to evaluate the longer-term effects. Robust systems for the identification of, and service delivery to, populations being targeted by the selective programme are also needed to enable sufficient vaccination uptake and ensure a selective policy does not result in a practice of no vaccination.

Sarah Jackson, PhD candidate, School of Nursing and Midwifery, and lead author of the study said:

""Although work had been done to predict future effects of stopping universal BCG vaccination in Ireland, it had not been retrospectively assessed until this study. Our findings support the introduction of a selective BCG programme to prevent severe paediatric TB and support the global TB elimination goal.""

Professor Catherine Comiskey, School of Nursing and Midwifery, and supervisor of the study said:

""Furthermore, I urge the relevant health authorities to make the selective BCG vaccination available. We have learned from our recent past dealing with COVID-19 and measles cases how important vaccination is to protect our younger, older, and at-risk populations. When best practice and national and international evidence advises us who to vaccinate, we all need to listen and get our relevant immunisations.""

""Our model consistently identifies the most potent storms and accurately forecasts where the strongest wind damage will occur. Such precise information could revolutionize real-time forecasting, allowing for targeted warnings in the most vulnerable areas,"" Zhang said.

The significance of this technique is further underscored in regions lacking extensive ground-based weather monitoring systems. Traditional radar, commonly employed in forecasting, is absent in many parts of the world. By utilizing satellite data alone, Penn State scientists demonstrated the capability to generate reliable forecasts for areas bereft of such infrastructure.

Building on previous endeavors that assimilated infrared brightness temperature data from satellites, which detail atmospheric water vapor and cloud formation by measuring radiation emitted from Earth's surface and atmosphere, this research adds a novel dimension. Microwave sensors, capable of penetrating clouds to observe atmospheric conditions below, offer a comprehensive view of storm dynamics.

""This innovation allows us to discern the convection processes within storms, providing a clearer picture of where and how severe weather will unfold,"" explained Zhang. The integration of microwave data significantly enhanced the precision of surface gust and wind speed predictions during the derecho event.

Looking ahead, Zhang aims to extend the application of this satellite-based forecasting method to regions with limited meteorological infrastructure, like West Africa. Such areas, prone to extreme weather events exacerbated by global warming, could greatly benefit from improved forecast accuracy.

Penn State's Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science faculty, including professors David Stensrud and Eugene Clothiaux, as well as assistant professor Xingchao Chen, contributed to this pioneering research.

The World Bank reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Cambodia in enhancing the clean water sector during a meeting with Hem Vanndy at the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology & Innovation (MISTI) on March 19, 2024.

During the meeting, Minister emphasized Cambodia's dedication to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, striving for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030.

In the face of climate change, he stressed the importance of partnerships and welcomed support from strategic partners such as the World Bank.

Leading the World Bank's delegation, Maria Angelica Sotomayor, Water Practice Manager, expressed the Bank's interest in collaborating with MISTI on regulatory enhancements to ensure quality water services, especially among private water operators.

She also extended invitations to MISTI's officials to participate in the World Water Forum in Bali and the Singapore Water Week, offering opportunities for important knowledge exchange.

Given the large number of private water operators in Cambodia, Hem Vanndy highlighted the need for consolidation and stressed the importance of establishing a water regulator.

""If we are to achieve Cambodia SDG 6, public utilities such as the Phnom Penh and Siem Reap Water Supply Authorities must expand their roles in improving water accessibility and quality,"" he said.

Notre Dame is next,"She pulled out a white sheet of paper for the cameras -- battered, folded and oh-so-valuable.

""Because we've had so many changes, we've had to have a bunch of different lineups,"" McPhee-McCuin said, waiving the paper. ""...I got about five different lineups in my back pocket that I can go to.""

The one McPhee-McCuin threw at Marquette Saturday included both Rita Igbowke and Tyia Singleton -- who usually share the Rebels' reps at center -- and lacked a point guard. That's nothing new for Ole Miss, though. McPhee-McCuin has long since decided she's comfortable awarding ball-handling duties to the likes of Madison Scott or Kennedy Todd-Williams, who are anything but true point guards.

The inclusion of Singleton, who had not started since Feb. 8, looked like a stroke of genius. She set a season-high with 12 points on 6-of-8 shooting, snagged seven rebounds and finished plus-11.

Really, though, it was just an example of McPhee-McCuin choosing to trust experience. Singleton has started 84 games in a six-year career. And a new wrinkle never hurts, does it?

""In the art of war, surprise always gets people,"" McPhee-McCuin said, laughing.

Quietly, McPhee-McCuin has amassed a roster with enough depth to lay those traps, even accounting for the unavailability of Snudda Collins and KK Deans -- both starters.

Kharyssa Richardson came off the bench to score 10 big points -- eight of which came in the second half, where Ole Miss ran away from Marquette in a 67-55 victory that sets up a matchup with Notre Dame on Monday.

Ayanna Thompson, who averaged fewer than eight minutes per game coming in, played 23 on Saturday. She picked up three steals and was plus-13 on the night. Freshman guard Zakiya Stephenson did not turn the ball over and served up a pair of assists off the bench.

""Strength in numbers,"" Rebels star Madison Scott said. ""It takes everybody. One-through-15 is capable of coming in and impacting the game. We've been really intentional about being ready when our number is called. That's what Tyia did tonight. That's what Kharyssa did tonight. That's what everybody on that bench is capable of doing.""

GAME RECAP: Madison Scott saves Ole Miss vs Marquette in NCAA Tournament. Rebels get Notre Dame next

McPhee-McCuin still looks at the depth available to SEC powers like South Carolina and LSU with envy. But, four years after going 0-16 in conference play, she's built a team that can endure two very important absences and still look to the bench with confidence.

That's not a luxury everyone shares, even at the NCAA Tournament level. Marquette (23-9), with one point from its bench, certainly couldn't match up. And the Rebels knew it.

They favored a high-paced game early, predicting that Marquette would tire late. Ole Miss (24-8) outscored the Golden Eagles 18-9 in the fourth quarter.

""Everybody is willing to do whatever it takes to win,"" Scott said. ""So I'm extremely proud of them, and let's keep it going.""

At their last meeting on March 6, Faraday Township council heard a report from Bernice Crocker, the CAO, regarding a Request for Tender for municipal engineering services for the township's waste site to do the Ministry mandated work to evaluate and provide appropriate strategies to continue using the landfill and to adhere to the plan to close it at the appropriate time. They received three tenders; from Greer Galloway, BluMetric Environmental and Cambium. Crocker recommended they accept the proposals from either Greer Galloway or BluMetric. Council ultimately accepted the proposal from BluMetric for a maximum total cost for waste site activities over a four-year term in the amount of $144,256,28 plus HST or $36,064.07 plus HST per annum.

Crocker presented her report to council at their March 6 meeting regarding an RFT for municipal engineering services. Back in December, 2023 council adopted a resolution to do an RFT for municipal consultants for environmental services. Based on this direction from council, Crocker and staff prepared an RFT for a four-year term with the possibility of extending it for another four years. The deadline for this RFT was Feb. 22 and it requested engineering services for the municipal waste site and an hourly rate was requested for additional services as requested by the township.

The first proposal received was from Greer Galloway, with a maximum cost over the four-year term of $122,757.16 plus HST or $30,689.29 plus HST yearly. The second proposal was from BluMetric for $144,256,28 plus HST or $36,064.07 plus HST per annum. The third proposal was from Cambium for $169,760 plus HST or $42,440 per year. More details on these tenders can be found at www.faraday.ca under the agenda section in the March 6 council meeting under ""Clerk's report.""

Crocker told council that the above rates will remain the same over the four-year period. She said that the qualifications were excellent for all three tenders and that she wouldn't hesitate to use any of the three companies. She noted that the annual monitoring for each firm seems to rise by around $6,000 each year based on the proposals and she recommended that council review the fee schedules and expense schedules. Ultimately, she recommended going with either the first or second proposal, based on the lower cost of these tenders versus the third proposal.

During discussions, due to some unsatisfactory work allegedly done by Greer Galloway in the township many years ago, as well as Faraday's satisfaction and track record with BluMetric, who are already doing work for them on their waste site, council voted to go with the proposal from BluMetric for the municipal engineering services.

Deputy Mayor Marg Nicholson told Bancroft This Week that she believes council made a good decision selecting BluMetric to undertake the work required by the Ministry to evaluate and provide appropriate strategies to continue the landfill's usage and the future closure plan at the appropriate time. ""BluMetric is familiar with Faraday waste site and all the regulations that are applicable,"" she says.

The UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) and The James Hutton Institute have outlined a series of recommendations in a new report for CREW - Scotland's Centre of Expertise for Waters. It follows their previous study for CREW which revealed the country's lochs and reservoirs are already undergoing rapid and extensive warming, with water temperatures of most monitored lochs rising by between 0.25 and 1 degree Celsius per year between 2015 and 2019. That study also projected that between 2020 and 2080, loch and reservoir temperatures could further increase up to 3 degrees Celsius in total over that period.

Coupled with high concentrations of plant nutrients such as phosphorus, most of which enter water courses via agricultural runoff, this is fuelling outbreaks of algal blooms. These blooms negatively affect water quality and aquatic biodiversity, and produce toxins harmful to animals and people.

The estimated annual cost of £16.5 million includes higher water treatment costs, financial losses for local business when water courses are shut to the public, and reductions in property values in the surrounding area.

The new report for CREW, which is based at the Hutton, warns that if there is no action to limit global warming or nutrient pollution, the concentration of phosphorus in our waters could more than double, due to changes in land use and rainfall patterns. This, together with warmer waters, will greatly increase the risk of harmful algal blooms.

However, the researchers at UKCEH and the Hutton estimate that, under a best-case scenario where there is action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to follow sustainable land management practices, phosphorus pollution could fall by 20 per cent compared to now.

The report underscores that, until there is significant global action to tackle emissions and meet Paris Agreement targets on global warming, it is important that other measures are taken across Scotland to mitigate impacts.

The main recommendation emphasises the need to implement efficient land management policies and practices aimed at reducing the amount of phosphorus entering lochs and reservoirs. This crucial nutrient is present in fertilisers as well as animal and human waste.

Across most of Scotland, runoff from land is the main source of phosphorus pollution and is likely to increase because of climate change Only 1 per cent of the 7,000 lochs studied receive effluent from wastewater treatment works. However, excess nutrient pollution from wastewater is known to be an issue at some lochs, so tackling this would increase ecosystems' resilience to the impacts of climate change,

Freshwater ecologist Dr Linda May of UKCEH, lead author of the report, said: ""Our climate is changing rapidly and harmful algal blooms are becoming more common. This is reducing the value of our water courses for recreation, water supply and wildlife habitat. To mitigate these effects, we need to reduce nutrient inputs to our lochs and reservoirs.

""Our report shows that, by adopting more sustainable land use practices and lifestyles we can protect our lochs for future generations to enjoy.""

The authors of Mitigating Climate Change Impacts on the Water Quality of Scottish Standing Waters say small-scale interventions, such as installing more buffer strips on land near lochs, have much less impact in reducing phosphorus run-off.

Dr Miriam Glendell of The James Hutton Institute said: ""Our modelling has shown than more efficient use of fertilisers informed by regular soil testing to match applications to crop demand could almost halve the amount of nutrients being lost from land to water.

Regarding other possible solutions, the authors say more investigation is needed into the effectiveness, cost and environmental impact of chemical treatments and the removal of nutrient-rich sediment or water.

The Climate Change Committee has said that many climate-related risks in Scotland are largely unknown due to a lack of effective monitoring of our environmental systems, including our standing waters. The new report published by CREW reiterates this, adding that the risks of phosphorus pollution and of algal blooms should be monitored at individual sites in addition to regular soil testing on farms to encourage improved nutrient use efficiency.

The authors also call for a comprehensive assessment of the cost impacts of algal blooms, saying their calculation, is likely to be an underestimate. For example, it excludes veterinary and medical costs.

The estimated cost of a single outbreak at Loch Leven, based on loss of income to the fishery, hotels, restaurants and other local businesses, is about £2 million per year.

Rachel Helliwell, CREW Director, said: ""If action is not taken to mitigate the effects of climate change, it is likely that the frequency and magnitude of harmful outbreaks of algal blooms will increase, resulting in the failure of many waters to comply with international water quality standards and exceed the upper limits for safe use set by the World Health Organisation.""

Màiri McAllan, Cabinet Secretary for Wellbeing Economy, Net Zero and Energy in the Scottish Government, said: ""Like the linked challenge of climate change, the loss of species and degradation of our natural environment is an emergency. That's why the Scottish Government has committed to spending £65m on nature restoration during the course of this parliament via our Nature Restoration Fund - Scotland's largest ever fund for nature. This includes providing support for targeted tree planting on banks to help cool our rivers which will protect species such as wild Atlantic salmon.

""We've also committed £315m since 2015 through our Agri-Environment Climate Scheme (AECS) to support sustainable and regenerative farming practices, and this year's AECS also includes support for irrigation lagoons which should assist in water resource management and help in mitigating the effects of climate change.""",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Eurasia Review,0.09019607843137245,448936022,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b-180.jpeg,

Children need a fundamental sense of right and wrong to ensure they are prepared to make wise choices, contribute to the world, and become stable adults.

Young people need a clear sense of right and wrong and a commitment to integrity.

 Connection

Children with close ties to family, friends, school and community are more likely to have a solid sense of security that produces strong values and prevents them from seeking destructive alternatives.

Connections with other people, schools and communities offer young people the security that allows them to stand on their own and develop creative solutions.

 Contribution

It is a powerful lesson when children realise that the world is a better place because they are in it. Young people who contribute to the well-being of others will receive gratitude rather than condemnation.

They will learn that contributing feels good and may therefore more easily turn to others, and do so without shame.

When children realise that they can control the outcomes of their decisions and actions, they're more likely to know that they have the ability to do what it takes to bounce back.

Young people who understand privileges and respect are earned through demonstrated responsibility will learn to make wise choices and feel a sense of control.

[D]id you know that talking about the weather can actually help save the planet? Get thee to a climate cafe!

Lola Fadulu and Emily Schmall, NYT:

In a small room in Lower Manhattan, a group of eight New Yorkers sat in a circle sharing kombucha and their climate fears against the background of pattering rain and wailing sirens.

In Champaign, Ill., a psychotherapist facilitating a meeting for other therapists held up a branch of goldenrod, asking the half-dozen participants online to consider their connection to nature.

And in Kansas City, Mo., a nonprofit that runs a weekly discussion on Zoom began its session with a spiritual reading and a guided meditation before breaking into groups to discuss topics like the ethics of childbearing amid a fast-rising global population and concerns of resource scarcity.

All were examples of a new grass-roots movement called climate cafes. These in-person and online groups are places for people to discuss their grief, fears, anxiety and other emotions about the climate crisis.

Isn't that great? Stupid people have been bombarded with so much of this miserable nonsense that they're now huddling together in coffee houses for comfort. They're taking shelter from a storm that isn't really there.

This sort of ""news"" story is a good example of how the news launders their propaganda. First they scare everybody with ridiculous stories about the weather killing us all.

And here's the Weather Channel creating the next generation of climate neurotics: Forecast 2050: 'Weather Kids' Say There's Still Time.

The United Nations Development Programme is giving them a chance to take climate change into their own hands with a new global campaign called ""Weather Kids.""

The campaign, which will run in more than 80 countries, asks: ""What will our future look like if we do not take action urgently?""

It kicks off with a kid-presented forecast that looks ahead to the weather in 2050, based on current climate projection data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Climate Horizons reports.

The idea is to show what will happen if the world fails to uphold the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which pledged to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But ""Weather Kids"" also brings a positive message of hope, encouraging adults to take urgent climate action and empowering them to be part of the solution.

""Our model consistently identifies the most potent storms and accurately forecasts where the strongest wind damage will occur. Such precise information could revolutionize real-time forecasting, allowing for targeted warnings in the most vulnerable areas,"" Zhang said.

The significance of this technique is further underscored in regions lacking extensive ground-based weather monitoring systems. Traditional radar, commonly employed in forecasting, is absent in many parts of the world. By utilizing satellite data alone, Penn State scientists demonstrated the capability to generate reliable forecasts for areas bereft of such infrastructure.

Building on previous endeavors that assimilated infrared brightness temperature data from satellites, which detail atmospheric water vapor and cloud formation by measuring radiation emitted from Earth's surface and atmosphere, this research adds a novel dimension. Microwave sensors, capable of penetrating clouds to observe atmospheric conditions below, offer a comprehensive view of storm dynamics.

""This innovation allows us to discern the convection processes within storms, providing a clearer picture of where and how severe weather will unfold,"" explained Zhang. The integration of microwave data significantly enhanced the precision of surface gust and wind speed predictions during the derecho event.

Looking ahead, Zhang aims to extend the application of this satellite-based forecasting method to regions with limited meteorological infrastructure, like West Africa. Such areas, prone to extreme weather events exacerbated by global warming, could greatly benefit from improved forecast accuracy.

Penn State's Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science faculty, including professors David Stensrud and Eugene Clothiaux, as well as assistant professor Xingchao Chen, contributed to this pioneering research.

The University of Manchester team, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Innsbruck, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, observed these effects within a long-term field experiment in the European Alps. Their findings, funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and published in Global Change Biology, highlight the disruption to the crucial seasonal dynamics of alpine ecosystems, particularly between plant and soil microbial communities.

Dr. Arthur Broadbent, the study's lead author, emphasized, ""Our research sheds light on the critical timing of ecosystem functions and how climate change is throwing these out of balance. The rapid warming of high mountain areas serves as a warning signal for the impact of climate change on our planet.""

This study demonstrates the intricacies of nutrient exchange between plants and soil microbes, a cycle vital for maintaining the alpine ecosystem's health. Snow cover traditionally insulates the soil during winter, enabling microbial activity and plant survival through harsh conditions. Predictions indicate an 80-90% reduction in snow cover across the European Alps by the century's end, alongside a significant advancement in snowmelt timing, threatening these essential ecological processes.

Prof. Michael Bahn from the University of Innsbruck and project collaborator remarked on the critical implications of diminishing snow cover for alpine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, underscoring the urgency of addressing these climate change effects.

The comprehensive study underlines the compounded challenges posed by climate change, disrupting below-ground ecological processes vital for plant growth in alpine settings. Prof. Richard Bardgett, Principal Investigator, warned of the potential enduring impacts on biodiversity and the functioning of these ecosystems, stressing the importance of understanding multifaceted climate change impacts on ecosystems.",terradaily.com,news,Terra Daily,,-0.04313725490196074,448935835,1,https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/austrian-alpine-scene-mountain-stream-hg.jpg,eng-9415208

They received three tenders; from Greer Galloway, BluMetric Environmental and Cambium. Crocker recommended they accept the proposals from either Greer Galloway or BluMetric. Council ultimately accepted the proposal from BluMetric for a maximum total cost for waste site activities over a four-year term in the amount of $144,256,28 plus HST or $36,064.07 plus HST per annum.

Crocker presented her report to council at their March 6 meeting regarding an RFT for municipal engineering services. Back in December, 2023 council adopted a resolution to do an RFT for municipal consultants for environmental services. Based on this direction from council, Crocker and staff prepared an RFT for a four-year term with the possibility of extending it for another four years. The deadline for this RFT was Feb. 22 and it requested engineering services for the municipal waste site and an hourly rate was requested for additional services as requested by the township.

The first proposal received was from Greer Galloway, with a maximum cost over the four-year term of $122,757.16 plus HST or $30,689.29 plus HST yearly. The second proposal was from BluMetric for $144,256,28 plus HST or $36,064.07 plus HST per annum. The third proposal was from Cambium for $169,760 plus HST or $42,440 per year. More details on these tenders can be found at www.faraday.ca under the agenda section in the March 6 council meeting under ""Clerk's report.""

Crocker told council that the above rates will remain the same over the four-year period. She said that the qualifications were excellent for all three tenders and that she wouldn't hesitate to use any of the three companies. She noted that the annual monitoring for each firm seems to rise by around $6,000 each year based on the proposals and she recommended that council review the fee schedules and expense schedules. Ultimately, she recommended going with either the first or second proposal, based on the lower cost of these tenders versus the third proposal.

During discussions, due to some unsatisfactory work allegedly done by Greer Galloway in the township many years ago, as well as Faraday's satisfaction and track record with BluMetric, who are already doing work for them on their waste site, council voted to go with the proposal from BluMetric for the municipal engineering services.

Deputy Mayor Marg Nicholson told Bancroft This Week that she believes council made a good decision selecting BluMetric to undertake the work required by the Ministry to evaluate and provide appropriate strategies to continue the landfill's usage and the future closure plan at the appropriate time. ""BluMetric is familiar with Faraday waste site and all the regulations that are applicable,"" she says. ""Their expertise will be of financial benefit to the township.""

Most are in big metroplexes, where the population can support the entertainment, dining and other venues that are major draws at these destinations.

Most famous streets around the country have a continental climate, with warm summers and cold winters.

Due to the variations in weather conditions, the tourist season swells during the spring and summer and tappers off at many during the fall and winter.

So, before you pack your bags, here's a look at the climate of some of America's most renowned streets.

5 WEATHER STORIES THAT ARE AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE

A stretch of Michigan Avenue that is home to upscale retail and other attractions is known as The Magnificent Mile. According to The Magnificent Mile Association, the 13-block stretch of North Michigan Avenue is home to more than 460 stores, 275 restaurants and 60 hotels.

The region's proximity to Lake Michigan tends to make it cooler during the summer and warmer during the winter.

January is the city's coldest and snowiest month, with some 38.8"" of frozen precipitation that falls every year.

The 307-mile-long lake can help increase wind speeds in the Chicagoland region, but the nickname of the ""Windy City"" is not at all weather-related.

According to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, the yearly average wind speed is around 10.3 mph, which ranks lower than many cities, including Boston, Minneapolis and Kansas City, Missouri.

It is widely cited that Cincinnati labeled Chicago the ""Windy City"" as part of a jab during the 1800s, as the communities were rivals in many aspects of society after the Industrial Revolution.

WHAT IS A SNEAKER WAVE?

The City of San Francisco says the most crooked street in the world draws more than 2 million visitors annually. While Lombard Street extends for more than 2 miles, it is a one-block section in the upscale Russian Hill neighborhood that everyone yearns to visit.

So, why does the street resemble a snake? According to the group Visit California, engineers designed the street to be safe for automobiles and walkers during the 1920s when the conveniences of modern brakes weren't around. Without the zig-zagging nature, the incline of 27 degrees would be daunting for even the best driver.

The San Francisco Bay Area is home to several microclimates due to the terrain and nearby maritime influence.

Due to a rather steady onshore flow, summers can be cool with plenty of fog, while winters stay rather warm and rainy.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER

The main thoroughfare in Miami's South Beach is dotted with hotels, restaurants and bars. This area is commonly referred to as the Art Deco district and has served as the backdrop to many movie and television scenes.

Due to its proximity to the Atlantic, Ocean Drive stays cooler than inland communities of South Florida, though it does not come without its perils.

At least once a year, South Florida is threatened by tropical cyclone activity between June and November.

Outside of the threat of hurricanes, thunderstorms are numerous and occur on more than 80 days of every year.

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro was declared the most impacted region by lightning in a 2023 study by Vaisala, a global technology company.

More than 120,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strokes were tallied, making the region the most lightning-prone metropolitan area in the country.

It doesn't have to be rainy to see high water levels along the coast. A phenomenon known as sunny-day flooding has increased in frequency in low-lying coastal areas.

A tourist attraction that constitutes about 13 blocks of the French Quarter is the world-famous Bourbon Street. The street is often the center attraction during big events such as Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest and pop-up festivals.

The area was named after French explorers founded the city in the early 1700s, and ever since then, residents have battled a wide variation of weather impacts.

Due to the proximity to the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, marshes and the Gulf of Mexico, high humidity levels are quite common. Levels typically peak in August and are lowest in March.

Temperature extremes are common since summers are warm and winters are rather chilly.

The official weather observation site at the Louis Armstrong International Airport reached its coldest value ever on February 13, 1899, at 6 °F and recently reached an all-time record high of 105 °F on August 27, 2023.

Being located on the Gulf of Mexico also makes the city and the French Quarter susceptible to hurricanes.

According to a NOAA historical database, the city is impacted by a hurricane about once every decade, but other locations in Louisiana experience more frequent events.

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 caused extensive damage along the Gulf Coast, but the French Quarter was largely spared from the flooding because of its high terrain and limited storm surge.

Due to extreme weather events during the summer and the fall, most tourist activities are held during the first half of the year.

FLORIDA MAN DESCRIBES PRYING HIS HEAD OUT OF A 12-FOOT ALLIGATOR'S MOUTH AS 'NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE'

A 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard is known as the world-renowned Strip, which is home to casinos, hotels, restaurants and entertainment. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, more than 40 million people visit the Strip yearly, with around 6 million just for conventions.

Fortunately, most venues are indoors, which keeps visitors from being exposed to the region's extreme weather.

When ridges of high pressure are in control, temperatures can soar to well over 100 °F.

The all-time record temperature is 117 °F, which was set back on July 10, 2021.

When the ridges of high pressure lose control during the summer, the monsoon pattern can kick in, producing flooding rains.

On average, Sin City receives less than 5"" of rainfall but also occasionally sees snow.

According to National Weather Service data, Southern Nevada sees 0.3"" of snow annually, but many years end up accumulating less than a trace.

The most snowfall ever reported happened during the winter of 1948-49, when 16.7"" fell.

WHAT ARE EL NINO AND LA NINA CLIMATE PATTERNS?

The nickname of ""The Big Apple"" has nothing to do with the popular fruit but is said to have originated from horse racing in the 1920s.

In the city of more than 8 million people, Broadway Street runs for more than 13 miles from Manhattan through Times Square.

New York City annually hosts more than 60 million visitors a year from all over the world.

Due to its proximity to the water, portions of the city are considered to lie in a humid subtropical zone, but it can also can be characterized as a humid continental climate.

Its location in the mid-latitudes assures it is susceptible to weather extremes.

Central Park's coldest day happened on February 9, 1934, when the mercury reached -15 °F, and its warmest day ever was 106 °F on July 9, 1936.

Snowfall is highly variable and can occur on any date between October and late April.

The greatest snowfall event happened during the historic blizzard of 2006, when many cities along the I-95 corridor were snowed in.

Central Park reported nearly 27"" of snow - its all-time record event.

No other street screams Americana more than Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the United States Capitol to the White House. All states and the territory of Puerto Rico have a roadway named after them in the District of Columbia, but it is believed that Pennsylvania got the prime naming rights since Philadelphia was the first capital city after the Constitution was ratified.

Summers are typically mild and humid, while winters produce varying degrees of severity.

The average humidity level of between 60-70%, in combination with temperatures around 90 degrees, often triggers heat emergencies.

The city averages just under 14"" of snow a year, with the first trace occurring around Thanksgiving and the last few inches happening in March.

Due to its location along the Potomac River and the Tidal Basin, locations such as the National Mall and Georgetown are vulnerable to flooding caused by heavy rainfall and high tides.

The National Park Service has embarked on a nearly $200 million project to enhance bulkheads and seawalls around historic sites, but more than 100 cherry trees will have to be removed.

Beale Street is a National Historic Landmark in the heart of Memphis, Tennessee, that serves as the Home of the Blues and is often linked to the start of Elvis Presley's career. Presley's Graceland estate is less than a 20-minute drive from Beale Street.

Due to the region's location next to the Mississippi River, extreme flooding can threaten the area.

Memphis' mid-South location allows for a great deal of variability in weather patterns.

Severe weather season typically runs from February into May, with a secondary peak in the late fall.

The city's highest reported temperature occurred on July 13, 1980, when the mercury reached 108 °F.

Heat waves are fairly common during the summer when the heat index can soar to well over 100 degrees. The index is a measure of how hot it feels to your body when the humidity factor is combined with the air temperature.

Less common extreme events include earthquakes and snowstorms.

WHAT IS A MICROMOON?

Museums, landmarks and other destinations sit along a nearly 5-mile stretch of Hollywood Boulevard. Around the boulevard are more than 2,700 brass stars who honor professionals in entertainment along the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

According to the Walk of Fame Committee, a person can receive a star for: professional achievements, longevity in the entertainment industry, contributions to the community and a guarantee they'll be at the dedication.

The weather across Southern California doesn't have a great deal of variability, with a yearly maximum average temperature of 75 degrees.

Exceptions happen and according to the region's official observation site, Los Angeles has been as warm as 113 degrees and as cold as 28 degrees.

Its location along the Pacific's Ring of Fire means earthquakes are relatively common, with around 100 occurring daily in the Golden State.

The costliest earthquake in the country's history impacted the region on Jan. 17, 1994.

According to the State of California, the magnitude 6.7 quake, known as the Northridge earthquake, killed at least 72 people and led to $60 billion in losses.

Geologists say earthquakes in this part of California are not triggered directly by the San Andreas Fault but by what are known as thrust faults.

WHAT HAPPENS UNDERWATER DURING A HURRICANE?

I-Drive is one of the main thoroughfares in Orlando's tourist district and sits just outside of theme parks such as the Magic Kingdom and Universal. The region is one of the top destinations for attractions, dining and shopping outside of the major theme parks. It's home to Madame Tussauds wax museum, SeaWorld, a giant Ferris wheel, the world's largest McDonald's and much more.

An average summer day usually tops out at around 92 degrees, while an afternoon during the heart of the winter can reach the lower 70s.

The combination of warm air temperatures, moisture and sea breezes are the main ingredients that align for showers and thunderstorms to pop up during the afternoons.

In Orlando, the rainy season begins around May 27, when it is not uncommon for storms to produce damaging winds, hail, lightning or even waterspouts and brief tornadoes.

Being centered in the Peninsula means the threat for tropical cyclones exists from June through November.

Orlando is about an hour's drive from the Atlantic coast and a two-hour drive from the Gulf of Mexico.

Since the 1970s, there have been less than a dozen occasions when major theme parks have temporarily halted operations due to an impending hurricane.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.3803921568627451,448935636,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/fox_weather_articles_483/844a8a37e40a15fb2eac110b7f2c7a7b,

As carbon dioxide levels continue to rise in the atmosphere, scientists are questioning whether climate change will enhance carbon sequestration through accelerated tree growth or expose rainforests to warmer, drier climates that could increase water stress, suppress tree growth, and dry out soils.

To examine how climate change is affecting tree species and carbon sequestration in tropical forests, Mark Ashton, Morris K. Jessup Professor of Silviculture and Forest Ecology at the Yale School of the Environment, along with a team of scientists calculated above-ground biomass from tree plots in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve in Sri Lanka over a 40-year period. The area has remained undisturbed by economic activity, offering the opportunity to determine trends in biomass, and the forests are notable for harboring the highest amounts of carbon of all tropical forests, making them a particularly critical source of climate change mitigation. The Sri Lanka plots examined by the team are dominated by dipterocarp, a tall forest tree in Southeast Asia, and are home to Ceylon ironwood (Mesua nagassarium), a slow-growing tree species valued for their dense wood.

The study, the first of its kind to examine above ground biomass for mixed dipterocarp forests, found that some of the long-lived, slow-growing tree species that characterize the forests are declining. Rather than acting as stable carbon sinks, some Sri Lankan forests affected by climate change are now carbon sources, the authors concluded in the study published in Forest Economy.

""There's a lot of emphasis on the ability of growing forests to sequester carbon, but studies of old forests with especially large trees that sequester carbon and mitigate climate are few and far between,"" Ashton said. ""The studies that do exist are based on relatively short time spans and don't really take into account the fact that climate change itself is affecting these forests. There's growing evidence that old forests might be more susceptible to the impacts of climate change than younger forests.""

Between 1978 and 2018, there was an average decline of 17% in biomass across three sites in the forests, with Ceylon ironwood accounting for the highest proportion of that decline, the scientists found. Late-successional, slow-growing trees contributed to the largest declines, releasing their stored carbon as they expired. Drought episodes as a result of climate change, along with fungal pathogens, likely killed the trees, the scientists said.

Ashton and the co-authors said the study highlights the importance of protecting and managing the rain forests so they can continue to function as carbon sinks and build resilience to climate change, insects, diseases, and land use conversion.

""A lot of people think that the sheer diversity of rainforest tree species makes them very resilient,"" Ashton said. ""But that's not necessarily true.

Fronting a crowd at AUT's Manukau South Campus this afternoon, the former prime minister used his first major speech as Opposition leader to attack the government's new policy shifts, while pushing his own party values.

Hipkins particularly took aim at National's accounting and an alleged multi-billion dollar hole - Finance Minister Nicola Willis denies the shortfall - telling the audience the government now couldn't deliver on its fiscal pledges.

""Let me be absolutely clear. The financial crisis the current government claim to have inherited is one they have created for themselves.""

He said National's plan to slash spending on the public services to fund its promised tax cuts would leave Kiwis worse off, describing sector redundancies as a ""ruthless attack"".

""It is so easy to brand public servants as faceless bureaucrats, but they are people,"" he said.

""They are people with families, mortgages and they work tirelessly. National is rewarding that hard work with redundancy and an uncertain future.""

Hipkins told the audience the Government's lower spending goal ""simply means they take from the many to give to the few - and life will only get worse for most people"".

On tax, Hipkins argued the current system was ""inequitable"" and ""unsustainable"".

""We have one of the least diversified tax systems in the world, meaning public investment into things like health, education, welfare, housing and infrastructure is more reliant on income tax than most other countries we compare ourselves to,"" he said.

""In other words, those who earn their living through their salary and wages are contributing a greater share than those who earn income through wealth.

""Under this government, those with multiple investment properties are getting huge tax breaks while those on salary and wages pay tax on every dollar they earn.""

Labour would shortly be releasing a series of discussion documents on key issues, including tax, he said.

""When the 2026 general election rolls around we will be more prepared for government than any opposition in our country's history.""

Today's address follows a tumultuous week in politics, in which Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was again forced to field questions about coalition partner Winston Peters, after the NZ First leader comparing elements of race issues in New Zealand to Nazi Germany.

At the same time, Hipkins himself was on Thursday forced to acknowledge his party's Auckland light rail and KiwiBuild policies were ""undeliverable"" when proposed ahead of the 2017 election.",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,,-0.1764705882352942,448935591,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/ZCLVZNGRV5BWZPPGLUUI5FJQ44.jpg?auth=514e01549b753c196d7c54b9cf692799862b64c016550d5d3292b47a5114f5ee&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,eng-9421023

Polygon zkEVM, which is natively compatible with ERC-20-based applications, was launched almost a year ago on March 27, 2023. It offers a scalability solution for decentralized applications (DApps) that run on the Ethereum blockchain. In the space of this one year, Polygon zkEVM has not been able to gain the kind of attention other Layer-2 similar to it has received within the same period.

Per data reference, the protocol has seen fewer transactions than many of its competitors in the past.

As showcased, the Layer-2 blockchain was unable to successfully sequence or add extra blocks during the ongoing outage. Data from multiple block explorers suggest that the last time a bock was added to the chain was more than 12 hours ago. The team behind the Polygon zkEVM is yet to offer any explanation to the sudden outage.

However, there is a message on the zkEVM section of Polygonscan that reads;

""The zkEVM mainnet network is currently on-going unscheduled maintenance, block data might not be up to date.""

It is not yet certain if the explanation of an ""on-going unscheduled maintenance"" is the actual reason for the outage.

Notably, the crypto industry has really been susceptible to outages in recent weeks with Coinbase and Solana at the center of it. A recent outage in the Coinbase ecosystem ended up leaching about $100 billion in market value from the broader crypto capitalization.

There was a recurrence shortly after the price of Bitcoin soared to its ATH. Within 24 hours, data from Downdetector showed that there had been a bulk of problem reports submitted detailing the Coinbase outage.

Crypto commentator MartyParty believed that the outage was a result of the inferior tooling and technologies that the firm adopted. To allay user's fears, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO clarified that the firm is planning to invest in better infrastructure to accommodate its massive demand.

Similarly, Solana was also a victim of multiple outages, and one of them which happened in February rendered the platform dysfunctional for about 5 hours. Market commentators believe these outages are growing and need to be curtailed before they eventually end up causing irreversible damage to the crypto ecosystem.

Its effect on prices of the underlying crypto may equally be negatively impacted. At the time of this writing, Polygon MATIC was trading at $0.9926 with a 3.22% increase in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the news of the outage has not taken the predicted toll on price.

Even though the character of Deaner has been in intriguing storylines during his time in TNA, he has never been able to get over the hump in terms of success in the ring. The latest fizzle was the disintegration of the Design. Deaner lost his way, so he went to the people looking for direction.

The Grizzled Young Veterans and the Time Splitters had a match scheduled, but Deaner entered the ring first to speak his mind. His decisions have led to failure, and now he is accepting the blame. Deaner recounted the best decision he ever made was to fall in love with wrestling as a fan. The fans share love and passion for the sport that Deaner has lost. He needs the people's help to get his passion back. Deaner declared that the people will choose his decisions.

It wouldn't take long for the people to make their first choice on behalf of Deaner. The Grizzled Young Veterans arrived to the ring ready for their match. James Drake and Zack Gibson rudely ordered Deaner to leave. Deaner asked the people what to do, and they chanted to stay. Deaner obliged and threw punches at his foes. GYV pounded him out, then the Time Splitters ran in to start their match.

That is a pretty smooth storytelling move to give the power to the people. Deaner needed purpose, and now he has a gimmick that will naturally incline fans to care.

As for the tag team match, Deaner didn't play a role in that. GYV battled the Time Splitters in a rowdy affair. Alex Shelley and Kushida worked through their issues to get on the same page by the end. Kushida blocked the Doomsday Device with a Tanaka punch to Drake in midair. Kushida escaped off Gibson's shoulders and sent the vet into a Shellshock from Shelley. Kushida applied the Hoverboard Lock on Drake for victory. Afterward, it looked like the tension between the Time Splitters was thawed. If you're in the mood for quality tag team action, press play.

Let's boogie through the rest of the show.

X-Division #1 contender: Jake Something defeated Leon Slater, Chris Bey, Alan Angels, Jason Hotch, and Kevin Knight. Mustafa Ali held the Rebellion Referendum contest to determine his challenger at the Sacrifice PPV on April 20. Jake hossed through the scramble match to pin Hotch on a spinning side slam. Ali was noticeably worried about defending against a man with Jake's power.

Dango feels that he is on the rise, but John E. Bravo and Oleg Prudius are anchors holding him down. Prudius didn't take kindly to that negative assertion, and he ditched Dango's gazebo. That might be the end of their partnership.

Next week, AJ Francis and Rich Swann will explain Swann's new association with Top Dolla.

Alexander Hammerstone justified his loss to Josh Alexander as a victory. When Hammer hit the Nightmare Pendulum, Alexander rolled out of the ring like a coward to avoid defeat. Hammerman justified his cheating in the rematch by claiming he already knew he was the better wrestler, so he decided to beat down Alexander instead. Hammerstone is bigger, stronger, and smarter.

TNA Digital Media Championship: Crazzy Steve defeated PCO to retain the title. PCO was in control when Big Kon moseyed down to the ring to cause a ruckus. The hoss war continued. Steve distracted the referee as Kon slammed PCO onto chairs. Steve scored a roll-up to keep his gold.

Decay and MK Ultra both want their contractual Knockouts tag team title rematches against Spitfire. Rosemary proposed a match versus Masha Slamovich to determine who gets first dibs.

Eric Young wants payback on Frankie Kazarian for screwing in his world title match. Young demanded Full Metal Mayhem (TLC), and TNA obliged for Sacrifice.

Ash by Elegance defeated Seleziya Sparx. Ash ordered Sparx kiss her hand like royalty. When Sparx refused, a beatdown ensued. Ash was victorious via swan dive. Afterward, Ash decided to dish out more punishment with a chair. Xia Brookside ran in for the save.

Nic Nemeth made his intentions clear to become TNA world champion. Steve Maclin tried to run him out of the company, but Nemeth is still here. He was happy to keep grinding to earn the title shot, however, TNA offered it sooner than he expected. Nemeth isn't going to let that opportunity slip through his fingers at Sacrifice. The System entered the scene with Moose delivering a mic drop. Moose won't deny that Nemeth is an accomplished wrestler, but there is one thing Nemeth could never do. That is to beat the system (wordplay reference to WWE).

Knockouts Championship: Jordynne Grace defeated Tasha Steelz to retain the title. (Full details here.) Steelz had speed on her side, but Grace's power was too much to handle. Grace blocked Steelz's signature moves, then the Juggernaut cracked a spinning backfist. Grace finished with the pumphandle driver.

Zooplankton, aquatic microorganisms that reside in nearly all bodies of water, are extremely sensitive to changes in their ecosystem. This hypersensitivity makes them important bioindicators of water quality, and studying how they interact with their environment can provide researchers with detailed snapshots of a region's present ecological condition.

By taking a new look at more than two decades of plankton monitoring data, researchers at The Ohio State University found that in western Lake Erie, zooplankton communities are undergoing a substantial change in the timing of certain events in their life cycles.

Using data collected from previous studies, the team examined the behavior patterns of four common types of zooplankton populations in Lake Erie between 1995 and 2022. Their analysis showed that due to factors like rising temperatures, the presence of invasive species and the availability of high-quality food, the period when zooplankton concentrations are at their highest now varies by as much as three weeks in the summer months.

""Warming is making natural events happen earlier, as we can see across basically all ecosystems,"" said Jim Hood, lead author of the study and an associate professor in evolution, ecology and organismal biology at Ohio State. ""These systems are really complex, and any disruption is likely to have unseen negative effects.""

Even in lakes, zooplankton play a central role in the local freshwater food web, from determining which types of algae thrive to helping sustain local fish populations, said Hood. Yet as the research notes, early warming can often advance the emergence of spring plankton while delaying fall populations, which can have a big impact. Because of their vital place in the food chain, major changes in plankton behavior could cause damage to other top-down and bottom-up processes that rely on them.

The study, recently published in the journal Limnology and Oceanography Letters, marks one of the first times scientists have tried to unpack the complexity of these dynamics in Lake Erie and the Great Lakes region.

Some of the most dominant changes observed in the timing of zooplankton emergence were caused by temperature variation as well as an invasive phytoplankton species called B. longimanus, which was likely carried over from Europe by shipping boats, said Hood.

""It's this invasive predator and the increase in harmful algae blooms that are really altering the timing of zooplankton concentrations,"" he said. ""In some cases, they're causing them to move in earlier, in some cases, they're moving them in later.""

Though Lake Erie has been plagued by harmful algal blooms for decades, warmer temperatures during the summer cause the organisms to grow thicker and faster. Because large blooms release toxins that endanger the health of humans and other animals and threaten important utility infrastructures, environmental scientists have been steadily working toward ways of addressing the multiple causes of their excess growth.

""It's not just climate change,"" said Hood. ""All of the things humans are doing to these systems, like bringing in invasive species, are creating a complex series of interactions that are going to influence big things that people care about, like harmful algal blooms and fisheries.""

This study's analysis period took place between May and September of each year when the four zooplankton species whose behavioral patterns being surveyed were especially abundant. Though they all had different diets and life histories, they surprisingly each had varying reactions to B. longimanus and its effects on the ecosystem, revealing that the mechanisms that drive the timing of certain plankton behaviors are more sophisticated than they seem, said Hood.

""It was really noteworthy how these four taxa that we focused on all had different responses to this invasive species, which really highlights the need for more research on them,"" he said.

Hood and co-author Jenna Bailey suggested that further research should aim to extend monitoring in temperate lakes to learn how winter conditions influence zooplankton life cycles, offering insight into other freshwater ecology issues related to climate change.

""It's difficult to predict the effects human activity has on our ecosystems,"" said Hood. ""But we need to step back and understand how all of these things that we're doing are interacting with one another and incorporate that into our management.""",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Eurasia Review,0.1843137254901961,448935388,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lake-1-e1711239004376.jpg,

The European Committee of the Regions (CoR), together with the founding partners of the EU-wide coalition #CohesionAlliance, launched a joint call to the European institutions and national governments to keep Cohesion Policy as the main pillar of the EU's development model in the next decade.

Recent farmers' protests are the most visible sign of a rising discontent against EU's green and economic policies that could increase poverty and social exclusion across the continent, notably in rural areas. During the plenary debate that animated the first day of the 10th European Summit of Regions and Cities in Mons (Belgium), national ministers, European Commissioners, representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU, together with regional governors and mayors, agreed on the imperative need for Europe to achieve a green transition that is fair for all citizens and industrial sectors. Economic, social and territorial cohesion should be at the top of the EU agenda, continue to boost digital and environmental transitions, and improve resilience to disasters and crises at all levels.

As outlined also by the former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, the Single Market can only be successful thanks to a strong Cohesion Policy supporting all regions. Mr Letta, who is currently President of the Jacques Delors Institute, was tasked by EU institutions to write a report on the future of the Single Market, to be published in the coming weeks.

During the debate, the President of the CoR, Vasco Alves Cordeiro, launched the #CohesionAlliance joint call on EU institutions and national governments for a ""renewed Cohesion Policy post-2027 that leaves no one behind"". The call states the principles on which the future EU regional policy should be based in order to remain a fundamental pillar of the EU development model and the core long-term, decentralised investment policy of the future EU budget.

Quotes:

Vasco Alves Cordeiro, President of the European Committee of the Regions, said: ""We now stand at a crossroads: as Europeans cast their vote, it is up to us that Europe answers with solidarity and progress. This is why, more than ever, we need to speak beyond those who are already convinced that Cohesion Policy is the solution to ensure that no people and no places are left behind in the wake of the green and digital transitions.""

Elisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, said: ""Cohesion Policy's crucial role in keeping Europe together was once again highlighted at this important Summit. In light of the unprecedented challenges the EU is facing, our common European house will only thrive if no place or person feels left behind, if we are able to harness everyone's talent in delivering on our ambitions. Cohesion Policy is now more necessary than ever!"".

Nicolas Schmit, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: ""The green and digital transitions have to work for everyone, or they will not work at all. Cohesion Policy is a powerful tool to help those most affected face the challenges the transitions bring, and to help all regions reap the benefits. The EU must keep fairness and inclusion at the heart of its policies going forward. Europe is its cities and regions"".

Enrico Letta, President of the Jacques Delors Institute and former Prime Minister of Italy, who was tasked by EU institutions to write a report on the future of the Single Market, said: ""The Single Market is made up of towns, territories and citizens, each with their own specific characteristics. As Jacques Delors has always advocated, the completion of the Single Market must be accompanied by cohesion policies that enable everyone to seize its opportunities.""

Observed concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide - reached record levels in 2022. Real-time data from specific locations show a continued increase in 2023.

CO2 levels are 50 % higher than the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere. The long lifetime of CO2 means that temperatures will continue to rise for many years to come.

The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average. 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record. This shattered the record of the previous warmest years, 2016 at 1.29 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850-1900 average and 2020 at 1.27±0.13 °C.

The ten-year average 2014-2023 global temperature is 1.20±0.12°C above the 1850-1900 average.

Globally, every month from June to December was record warm for the respective month. September 2023 was particularly noteworthy, surpassing the previous global record for September by a wide margin (0.46 to 0.54 °C).

The long-term increase in global temperature is due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The shift from La Niña to El Niño conditions in the middle of 2023 contributed to the rapid rise in temperature from 2022 to 2023.

Global average sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were at a record high from April onwards, with the records in July, August and September broken by a particularly wide margin. Exceptional warmth was recorded in the eastern North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the North Pacific and large areas of the Southern Ocean, with widespread marine heatwaves.

Some areas of unusual warming such as the Northeast Atlantic do not correspond to typical patterns of warming associated with El Niño, which was visibly present in the Tropical Pacific.

Ocean heat content reached its highest level in 2023, according to a consolidated analysis of data. Warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades.

It is expected that warming will continue - a change which is irreversible on scales of hundreds to thousands of years.

More frequent and intense marine heatwaves have profound negative repercussions for marine ecosystems and coral reefs.

The global ocean experienced an average daily marine heatwave coverage of 32%, well above the previous record of 23% in 2016. At the end of 2023, most of the global ocean between 20° S and 20° N had been in heatwave conditions since early November.

Of particular note were the widespread marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic which began in the Northern Hemisphere spring, peaked in extent in September and persisted through to the end of the year. The end of 2023 saw a broad band of severe and extreme marine heatwave across the North Atlantic, with temperatures 3 °C above average.

The Mediterranean Sea experienced near complete coverage of strong and severe marine heatwaves for the twelfth consecutive year.

Ocean acidification has increased as a result of absorbing carbon dioxide.

In 2023, global mean sea level reached a record high in the satellite record (since 1993), reflecting continued ocean warming (thermal expansion) as well as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets.

The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002).

Antarctic sea-ice extent reached an absolute record low for the satellite era (since 1979) in February 2023 and remained at record low for the time of year from June till early November. The annual maximum in September was 16.96 million km2, roughly 1.5 million km2 below the 1991-2020 average and 1 million km2 below the previous record low maximum.

Arctic sea-ice extent remained well below normal, with the annual maximum and minimum sea ice extents being the fifth and sixth lowest on record respectively.

Ice sheets: There are two principal ice sheets, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic ice Sheet. Combining the two ice sheets, the seven highest melt years on record are all since 2010, and average rates of mass loss increased from 105 Gigatonnes per year from 1992-1996 to 372 Gigatonnes per year from 2016-2020. This is equivalent to about 1 mm per year of global sea level rise attributed to the ice sheets in the latter period.

The Greenland Ice Sheet continued to lose mass in the hydrological year 2022-2023 It was the warmest summer on record at Greenland's Summit station, 1.0 °C warmer than the previous record. Satellite melt-extent data indicate that the ice sheet had the third highest cumulative melt-day area on record (1978-2023), after the extreme melt season of 2012 and 2010.

Glaciers: Preliminary data for the hydrological year 2022-2023 indicate that the global set of reference glaciers suffered the largest loss of ice on record (1950-2023), driven by extremely negative mass balance in both western North America and Europe.

Glaciers in the European Alps experienced an extreme melt season. In Switzerland, glaciers have lost around 10% of their remaining volume in the past two years. Western North America suffered record glacier mass loss in 2023 - at a rate which was five times higher than rates measured for the period 2000-2019. Glaciers in western North America have lost an estimated 9% of their 2020 volume over the period 2020-2023.

Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents. These included major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat and drought, and associated wildfires.

Flooding linked to extreme rainfall from Mediterranean Cyclone Daniel affected Greece, Bulgaria, Türkiye, and Libya with particularly heavy loss of life in Libya in September.

Tropical Cyclone Freddy in February and March was one of the world's longest-lived tropical cyclones with major impacts on Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi.

Tropical Cyclone Mocha, in May, was one of the most intense cyclones ever observed in the Bay of Bengal and triggered 1.7 million displacements across the sub-region from Sri Lanka to Myanmar and through India and Bangladesh, and worsened acute food insecurity.

Hurricane Otis intensified to a maximum Category 5 system in a matter of hours - one of the most rapid intensification rates in the satellite era. It hit the Mexican coastal resort of Acapulco on 24 October, causing economic losses estimated at around US$15 billion, and killing at least 47 people.

Extreme heat affected many parts of the world. Some of the most significant were in southern Europe and North Africa, especially in the second half of July. Temperatures in Italy reached 48.2 °C, and record-high temperatures were reported in Tunis (Tunisia) 49.0 °C, Agadir (Morocco) 50.4 °C and Algiers (Algeria) 49.2 °C.

Canada's wildfire season was the worst on record. The total area burned nationally for the year was 14.9 million hectares, more than seven times the long-term average. The fires also led to severe smoke pollution, particularly in the heavily populated areas of eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States. The deadliest single wildfire of the year was in Hawaii, with at least 100 deaths reported - the deadliest wildfire in the USA for more than 100 years - and estimated economic losses of US$5.6 billion.

The Greater Horn of Africa region, which had been experiencing long-term drought, suffered substantial flooding in 2023, particularly later in the year. The flooding displaced 1.8 million people across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

Long-term drought persisted in north-western Africa and parts of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as parts of central and southwest Asia. It intensified in many parts of Central America and South America. In northern Argentina and Uruguay, rainfall from January to August was 20 to 50% below average, leading to crop losses and low water storage levels.

Weather and climate hazards exacerbated challenges with food security, population displacements and impacts on vulnerable populations. They continued to trigger new, prolonged, and secondary displacement and increased the vulnerability of many who were already uprooted by complex multi-causal situations of conflict and violence.

One of the essential components for reducing the impact of disasters is to have effective multi-hazard early warning systems. The Early Warnings for All initiative seeks to ensure that everyone is protected by early warning systems by the end of 2027. Development and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies have increased since the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

The report cites figures that the number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023 (in 78 monitored countries by the World Food Programme). WFP Global hunger levels remained unchanged from 2021 to 2022. However, these are still far above pre-COVID 19 pandemic levels: in 2022, 9.2% of the global population (735.1 million people) were undernourished. Protracted conflicts, economic downturns, and high food prices, further exacerbated by high costs of agricultural inputs driven by ongoing and widespread conflict around the world, are at the root of high global food insecurity levels. This is aggravated by the effects of climate and weather extremes. In southern Africa, for example, the passage of Cyclone Freddy in February 2023 affected Madagascar, Mozambique, southern Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Flooding submerged extensive agricultural areas and inflicted severe damage on crops and the economy.

Renewable energy generation, primarily driven by the dynamic forces of solar radiation, wind and the water cycle, has surged to the forefront of climate action for its potential to achieve decarbonization targets.

Worldwide, a substantial energy transition is already underway. In 2023, renewable capacity additions increased by almost 50% from 2022, for a total of 510 gigawatts (GW). Such growth marks the highest rate observed in the past two decades and indicates, demonstrates the potential to achieve the clean energy goal set at COP28 to triple renewable energy capacity globally to reach 11 000 GW by 2030.

In 2021/2022, global climate-related finance flows reached almost USD 1.3 trillion, nearly doubling compared to 2019/2020 levels. Even so, tracked climate finance flows represent only approximately 1% of global GDP, according to the Climate Policy Initiative.

There is a large financing gap. In an average scenario, for a 1.5°C pathway, annual climate finance investments need to grow by more than six times, reaching almost USD 9 trillion by 2030 and a further USD 10 trillion through to 2050.

The cost of inaction is even higher. Aggregating over the period 2025-2100, the total cost of inaction is estimated at USD 1,266 trillion; that is, the difference in losses under a business-as-usual scenario and those incurred within a 1.5°C pathway. This figure is, however, likely to be a dramatic underestimate.

Adaptation finance continues to be insufficient. Though adaptation finance reached an all-time high of USD 63 billion in 2021/2022, the global adaptation financing gap is widening, falling well short of the estimated USD 212 billion per year needed up to 2030 in developing countries alone.",wmo.int,news,World Meteorological Organization,,0.1529411764705881,448935163,1,https://wmo.int/sites/default/files/2024-03/AdobeStock_181919907_0.jpeg,

Musk, leader of Tesla and SpaceX, recently schooled former CNN host Don Lemon on how that's possible.

Lemon: ""You claim that Democrats and Biden are opening the border to gain more votes, but undocumented immigrants cannot vote in federal elections, so how is that possible?""

Musk: ""If you look at the apportionment with and without illegals, I believe ... there would be a net loss for blue states of approximately 20 seats in the House. This also applies to electing the president because the electoral college votes are also done by apportionment the same way that House seats are done.""

Lemon: ""But the reason the electoral college is in place is to balance that so that doesn't happen. So, what you're saying about it is the exact opposite of the reason why the electoral college is there.""

Musk: ""My understanding is that Democrats would lose approximately 20 seats in the House if illegals were not counted in the census, and that's also 20 less electoral votes for president. So, illegals absolutely do affect who controls the House and who controls the presidency.""

The numbers cited by Musk are drawn from a five-year-old study by the Center for Immigration Studies which examined which states win and lose due to the influence of illegal immigration on the apportionment of congressional seats (Michigan is down two seats it would have if non-citizens weren't counted, the study says.) And while the report has been challenged, the premise is indisputable.

The Census Bureau includes undocumented immigrants and other non-citizens in the population counts that are used to divvy up the 435 congressional seats. Since the undocumented population is largest in Democratic states such as California, Illinois and New York, Democrats directly benefit from surges in illegal immigration their policies have encouraged.

It's not a huge leap to assume that's why President Joe Biden ignored the border crisis until it threatened reelection hopes, and why Democratic lawmakers are so determined to keep the borders wide open. The 7.2 million undocumented immigrants who have entered the United States under Biden's watch will have a huge impact on the next congressional reapportionment after the 2030 Census.

Two Republican senators have introduced a bill to stop that from happening. The Equal Representation Act, sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, would separate non-citizens from the population count used to award congressional seats.

""The current method of counting illegal immigrants for purposes of representation serves as a perverse incentive for open borders to boost the relative political power of the states and voters that court it,"" the sponsors write. No Democrats have signed onto the bill. Citizenship should come with certain privileges, among them the right to determine the nation's politics and policies. But already, the District of Columbia and communities in California, Maryland and Vermont allow non-citizens to vote in local elections.

A 1996 law keeps them from voting in federal elections. But as Musk correctly points out, it doesn't keep them from wielding influence they haven't earned on our political system.

Michael and Cheryl Shearer were announced winners of the region's Share Farmer of the Year Category at the annual awards dinner held in Shantytown on Saturday night. The other big winners were Trinity Jackson, who was named the 2024 West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Manager of the Year, and Alexandra Davidson, the 2024 West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Trainee of the Year.

The Shearers run a very tight ship that is sustainable and profitable in all pay-outs and say the once-a-day system allows for time out of the shed and off the farm.

""It's important to be able to give your mind a rest from the farm as this helps to keep your head and thoughts clear and remind you what is really important.""

The Shearers are 50/50 share milkers on Russell Andrews' 225ha Reefton farm milking 500 cows. They won $8,000 in prizes and four merit awards.

Michael was named 2014 Taranaki Farm Manager of the Year and in 2012 he placed third in the New Zealand Dairy Trainee of the Year competition after winning the West Coast Top of the South regional title.

He credits his previous Awards experiences with increasing his job opportunities and career progression as well as confidence and networking.

Michael and Cheryl have faced a few challenges over the past few seasons, including the 2019 Tasman Forest fire which saw them evacuating their cows and farm for two weeks.

""We returned to a fairly destroyed farm and a few years later lost 25% of our milking platform for 6 months in the 2022 Rai Valley floods.""

The Shearers maintain a positive outlook and see challenges as an opportunity to work out positive solutions.

""I actually enjoy the hard times as they drive you to better your business and find different options and ways of doing things,"" says Michael.

The couple are excited about the number of future options available in terms of farm ownership and aim to purchase as 400-cow farm soon.

""Long term we'd like to own a few farms that we can utilise to help young people into farm ownership.""

The New Zealand Dairy Industry Awards are supported by national sponsors CowManager, DeLaval, Ecolab, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, Honda, LIC, Meridian, Ravensdown, and Trelleborg, along with industry partners DairyNZ, MediaWorks and Rural Training Solutions NZ.

The runners-up in the Share Farmer category are Warric and Rachel Johnson who are contract milkers for Phil & Jocelyn Riley on their 375ha, 1100-cow Tapawera property. They won $3,500 and three merit awards.

Warric and Rachel began their farming journey 25 years ago and entered as they believed it would be a good opportunity to broaden their network, measuring themselves against others within the industry as well as a good learning experience.

The couple are proud that they have decreased their staff hours to 1950 hours average, per annum, per employee which means all their staff are earning over the hourly living wage.

""Farming is so much more than a job to us both, it's a lifestyle that not only we love but are also lucky enough to share with our children, grandchildren, extended family and friends,"" they say. ""It's not unusual for us both to go for an evening drive through the farm admiring the clover or grass cover and discussing what we can improve on or our future goals.""

""We feel farming isn't just about ""farming"", it's about meeting new people and forming a wide network. It's about 'always learning', because if you think you know everything there is to know, then it's probably time to hang up your boots and overalls.""

Third placegetter in the Share Farmer category was awarded to Mark and Esther Tubman who are contract milkers for John and Anne Freeman, on their 150ha, 345-cow Takaka property.

The second-time entrants placed third in the same category last year. They won $3,500 and one merit award.

Due to the minimum number of finalists not being reached, West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Manager entrant scores were benchmarked against the national average, with data collated from the 10 other regions.

This also means merit awards are awarded if the entrant achieved at the right level.

The winner of the 2024 West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Manager of the Year category is Trinity Jackson, who describes herself as a converted townie.

Trinity is farm manager for Pāmu Farms of New Zealand on the 441ha, 800-cow Moana property. She won $7,000 in prizes and three merit awards.

The third-time entrant was named runner-up in the 2022 West Coast Top of the South Dairy Trainee category and says there are many benefits to entering the Awards.

""The experience pushed me out of my comfort zone, and the feedback from the judges was incredible. It was an excellent way to challenge myself and meet new people.""

Trinity found her passion for animals and farming through her partner Tristan who introduced her to the lifestyle.

""I have an immense passion for animal welfare as well as a drive to challenge myself to produce a quality food product while protecting our environment.""

The 22-year-old is proud of the improvement and development made on-farm and seeing the results of hard work, especially regarding somatic cell count, production, presentation and personal development.

Trinity would like to be involved in innovation and ideas within the industry and help the next generation learn and grow in the farming industry.

Future farming goals include contract milking in 5-10 years' time.

Runner-up in the Dairy Manager category was Kieran Hamilton, who won $2,000 and three merit awards.

Kieran is farm manager for Pāmu Farms of New Zealand on the 471ha, 800-cow Moana property. He placed third in the same category last year.

Alexandra Davidson has been named winner in the 2024 West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Trainee of the Year category.

The 29-year-old is farm assistant on the Birchlea Trust 300ha, 725-cow farm at St Arnaud and took home $6,500 in prizes and one merit award. She placed third in the same category last year.

The second-time entrant holds a Bachelor of Teaching and a Diploma in Montessori Education and left early childhood teaching in Christchurch to take up an opportunity to explore the dairy farming idea further.

Alexandra says she still has a lot to learn and is proud of the number of skills and knowledge she has gained since entering the industry in April 2022.

""The dairy industry is always changing and I'm excited to upskill so I can manage a farm.""

Future goals include farm ownership and becoming a PrimaryITO tutor.

Runner-up in the Dairy Trainee category was 19-year-old 2IC Tomas Stanger who won $1,500 in prizes.

Tomas works on Pāmu Farms of New Zealand 482ha, 1060-cow property at Westport.

The first-time entrant was training to be a personal trainer before realising dairying was where he wanted to be.

Future farming goals include progressing to a manager's position within Pāmu Farms.

Third place in the Dairy Trainee category went to 24-year-old farm assistant Sapphire Jordan who won $1,000 in prizes and two merit awards.

Sapphire works on Elizabeth O'Connor's 86ha, 220-cow Richmond property.

The West Coast/Top of the South Dairy Industry Awards winners field day will be held on 9th April 2024 at 10.30am at 43 Garveys Creek Mine Road, Reefton 7871 S/N Westland Milk Products 556 where Share Farmers of the Year, Michael and Cheryl Shearer sharemilk. Also presenting at the field day will be the region's Dairy Manager of the Year, Trinity Jackson and Dairy Trainee of the Year, Alexandra Davidson.

Mountain ranges covering vast areas of the world are warming much faster than surrounding lowland areas, triggering huge reductions in snow cover and rapid upward movement of dwarf-shrubs, such as heather.

Scientists at The University of Manchester have found that these changes are disrupting the timing of crucial alpine ecosystem functions performed by plants and soil microorganisms.

The research, published today in the journal Global Change Biology and funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, shows that high mountain ecosystems may be less capable of retaining the important nutrients needed to sustain plant growth and maintain biodiversity in these harsh environments.

Dr Arthur Broadbent, lead author of the study, said: ""Our paper reveals how important the timing of many plant and soil processes are in seasonal ecosystems. People may be familiar with mismatches between plant flowering and the emergence of pollinators caused by climate change. In our study, we have demonstrated that plant and soil processes show fascinating seasonal dynamics, and that the timing of these processes can also be disrupted by climate change. The high mountains are like a canary in the coalmine because they are warming much faster than the global average. That makes our findings particularly alarming.""

Every year, seasonal changes in mountain ecosystems prompt large transfers of nutrients between plants and microbial communities in alpine soils. Following snowmelt in spring, plants start to grow and compete with soil microbes for nutrients, thereby triggering a shift in the storage of nutrients from soil to plants. This transfer is reversed in autumn, as plants die back, and nutrients are returned to the soil within dead leaves and roots.

During alpine winters, snow acts like an insulting blanket that allows soil microbes to continue functioning and store nutrients in their biomass and enables plants to survive cold alpine winters. Climate change is predicted to cause an 80-90% loss of snow cover by the end of the century in parts of the European Alps and advance the timing of snowmelt by five to 10 weeks.

Prof Michael Bahn, a collaborator on the project from the University of Innsbruck, said: ""Declining winter snow cover is one of the most obvious and pronounced impacts of climate change in the Alps. Its effects on the functioning and biodiversity of alpine ecosystems are a major concern for people living in Alpine regions and beyond.""

The scientists from The University of Manchester, in collaboration with the University of Innsbruck, Helmholtz Zentrum München, and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, carried out the work on a long-term field experiment in the European Alps. The findings highlight the detrimental effect of climate change on seasonal transfers and retention of nutrients between plants and soil microbes.

Richard Bardgett, Principal Investigator and Professor of Ecology at The University of Manchester's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said ""Our work demonstrates how the combination of different facets of climate change can severely disrupt below-ground ecological processes that underpin plant growth in alpine ecosystems, with potential long-term consequences for their biodiversity and functioning.""

For scientists, understanding how ecosystems respond to multiple simultaneous climate change impacts remains a major challenge. Interactions between direct and indirect climate change factors, such as snow cover change or less obvious ones such as dwarf-shrub expansion, can lead to sudden and unexpected changes in ecosystem functioning. These effects are impossible to predict by studying climate change factors in isolation.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Eurasia Review,0.3019607843137255,448934872,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b-179.jpeg,

Jaishankar spoke about how machines for the manufacture of semiconductors have started coming (to India) and also how India is progressing towards establishing the first three plants for this multi-billion dollar industry.

""There is a degree of purpose and seriousness as well as investment going into manufacturing that has not been seen for a long time,"" the Minister told a 300-plus audience, mostly Singapore-based members of the business community.

He was answering questions at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of the National University of Singapore (NUS) after a lecture on his book 'Why Bharat Matters.'

""A very productive interaction with leading Singaporean Corporate figures. ... Appreciate their positive feedback on the India growth story, based on investment experiences. ... Confident that their commitment to doing more business in India will further increase,"" Jaishankar later posted on X along with some photos from the event.

Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore and reached here earlier in the day, highlighted ""a very good global manufacturing response to the Production Linked Initiative (PLI) Scheme,"" but at the same time reminded the audience that India had missed the manufacturing bus in the previous decades.

Semiconductors are an essential component in almost everything, from electronic gadgets to consumer goods and from solar panels, satellites to weapons. Currently, India imports almost 90 per cent of its requirements of semiconductors.

Combining the two primary focus areas, the 'Digital India' and 'Make In India,' the Modi government has launched 'India Semiconductor Mission' as a specialised and independent business division to enable India's emergence as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design.

Jaishankar told the investor audience about three semiconductor plants being set up in India and said, ""We have started to get machinery for semiconductors today to start to build in India.""

The manufacturing message is being taken across the country, and clearly with better logistics and better talent, he pointed out.

Jaishankar also informed the guests that the government of India has entered into agreements with the country's universities for training by modernising and tweaking engineering courses in a way in which the resources for the semiconductor industry would start to flow.

""Right now, we are actually looking at a plan which would give us in the coming years at least 85,000 new people for jobs in the semiconductor zone .... It is something which we expect to grow.""

Jaishankar elaborated on the decade spent on building a foundation and goals set for achieving target-driven economic growth saying India has set 25-year goals for itself.

""That is something which is happening, the 2030 goal, and there's a 2040 goal. And there's a 2047 goal,"" said Jaishankar, calling on people to get more invested in all these changes happening (as development progresses within these goals), and urged people to start preparing themselves for what is to come.

FreakNik meant so much to me and the culture of my city. This documentary is just the beginning of a long and exciting journey.""

In 2019, Carlos established the FreakNik Festival Foundation Non-profit, signaling a commitment to celebrate the positive spirit of the 90s-era FreakNik. Emphasizing that this isn't a reenactment of the 90s FreakNik but a celebration of its essence, Carlos' vision earned recognition from the State of Georgia for its impact on the community via a health fair and positive economic impact to the City of Atlanta.

Central to Carlos' revamped FreakNik approach is community engagement and input from key figures in FreakNik's history. Notably, George Hawthorne, chair of the College Spring Break planning committee, joined Carlos board of directors, underscoring a commitment to learn from the past and shape a responsible future for FreakNik. Mr. Hawthorne stated in 2019, ""Had FreakNik been organized like Carlos' version, I would have voted differently in 1998.""

Moreover, Carlos's partnership with Ronn Greene, the original promoter and trademark holder of FreakNik, symbolizes a passing of the torch to ensure the brand's continued celebration and integrity.

With a steadfast dedication to social responsibility, safety, inclusivity, and diversity, Carlos introduces a FreakNik® licensing model to protect the brand's legacy and foster positive community engagement.

Mayor Khalid of South Fulton says, ""FreakNik was a cultural phenomenon that significantly contributed to Atlanta's reputation. I'm thrilled to see Carlos revive the brand and restore its original mission.""

Carlos' vision for FreakNik continues like the upcoming FreakNik Reunion on April 20, 2024, hosted by Grammy award winner Killer Mike, to encompass future media projects, including movies, TV series, and national concert tours.

Carlos humbly expresses gratitude to the dedicated individuals who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to revive the brand, recognizing their indispensable contribution to FreakNik's resurgence. Individuals such aTony Wyzard, Michael Williams of MWP Entertainment, Cassie Cope, Michael ""Bull"" Williams, Patrick Hall, Demarcus Travis, Jerome Rowland, and many others who have worked tirelessly to revive the brand.

Intriguingly, green technology might offer a single solution that addresses both of these environmental challenges in one go.

A technology company located at the Tseung Kwan O InnoPark is researching the use of recycled plastics to produce noise-absorbing meta-materials.

The firm's researchers heat and soften recycled plastics, then mould them into customised shapes to absorb sound. By stacking these acoustic meta-materials, various noise reduction products can be produced for use in applications ranging from indoor ceilings to soundproof rooms and roadside noise barriers, as well as on construction sites.

Research and development (R&D) engineer Mak Ho-yiu highlighted that the uniqueness of the materials produced lies in their structure.

""We target different acoustic problems and design different shapes to absorb sound,"" he said. ""For example, generators or industrial pumps generate low-frequency noise. Acoustic meta-materials can focus their sound absorption effects on low-frequency ranges.""

He added that materials such as metal, paper and wood can achieve the same effect, but explained that the research team had decided to use recycled plastic as their raw material of choice in order to address Hong Kong's plastic waste challenges.

Establishing operations

The two-year project has received about $3.3 million from the Green Tech Fund. The firm has hired experts in acoustic design and materials science and purchased acoustic and mechanical testing equipment.

In its first year of research work, the team established that PET, commonly found in bottles and utensils, and PVC, commonly used in construction materials, are both suitable for recycling to create acoustic meta-materials.

Company director Chen Shu-yu said the firm is now recycling plastic in the Mainland and producing products there, while its R&D work continues to be carried out in Hong Kong. The company also plans to establish a plant in Hong Kong to recycle plastics and mass-produce its noise-reduction products.

Research priorities

To lead Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality, in 2021 the Government outlined four key strategies in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050. These are focused on net-zero electricity generation; energy-saving and green buildings; green transport; and waste reduction.

To support R&D projects such as the acoustic-meta-materials one, the Government established the Green Tech Fund in 2020.

Principal Assistant Secretary for Environment & Ecology (Climate Change) Dorothy Ma said the fund gives priority to research projects that align with the action plan's decarbonisation strategies.

""These strategies aim to tackle three major sources of emissions in Hong Kong, namely electricity generation, the transport sector, and the waste sector. To address carbon emissions at the source, the Government has developed these four key carbon reduction strategies. If the funding application projects align with these strategies, they will be given priority.""

As of the end of 2023, the fund has approved 30 projects over three rounds of applications from local universities, public research institutions, and companies, awarding around $130 million in total.

The Environment & Ecology Bureau states that funded organisations are required to submit reports every six months to keep the fund updated on their progress, as well a final report upon completion for evaluation of their projects' effectiveness.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.1294117647058823,448934171,1,,

Current data from in-house Explorer has it that Polygon zkEVM is experiencing an outage that has rendered it inactive for more than 12 hours on Saturday.

Polygon zkEVM, which is natively compatible with ERC-20-based applications, was launched almost a year ago on March 27, 2023. It offers a scalability solution for decentralized applications (DApps) that run on the Ethereum blockchain. In the space of this one year, Polygon zkEVM has not been able to gain the kind of attention other Layer-2 similar to it has received within the same period.

Per data reference, the protocol has seen fewer transactions than many of its competitors in the past.

As showcased, the Layer-2 blockchain was unable to successfully sequence or add extra blocks during the ongoing outage. Data from multiple block explorers suggest that the last time a bock was added to the chain was more than 12 hours ago. The team behind the Polygon zkEVM is yet to offer any explanation to the sudden outage.

However, there is a message on the zkEVM section of Polygonscan that reads;

""The zkEVM mainnet network is currently on-going unscheduled maintenance, block data might not be up to date.""

It is not yet certain if the explanation of an ""on-going unscheduled maintenance"" is the actual reason for the outage.

Notably, the crypto industry has really been susceptible to outages in recent weeks with Coinbase and Solana at the center of it. A recent outage in the Coinbase ecosystem ended up leaching about $100 billion in market value from the broader crypto capitalization.

There was a recurrence shortly after the price of Bitcoin soared to its ATH. Within 24 hours, data from Downdetector showed that there had been a bulk of problem reports submitted detailing the Coinbase outage.

Crypto commentator MartyParty believed that the outage was a result of the inferior tooling and technologies that the firm adopted. To allay user's fears, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO clarified that the firm is planning to invest in better infrastructure to accommodate its massive demand.

Similarly, Solana was also a victim of multiple outages, and one of them which happened in February rendered the platform dysfunctional for about 5 hours. Market commentators believe these outages are growing and need to be curtailed before they eventually end up causing irreversible damage to the crypto ecosystem.

Its effect on prices of the underlying crypto may equally be negatively impacted. At the time of this writing, Polygon MATIC was trading at $0.9926 with a 3.22% increase in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the news of the outage has not taken the predicted toll on price.",coingape.com,news,Coingape,Godfrey Benjamin,0.05098039215686279,448934164,1,https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Polygon-blockchain.jpg,eng-9421060

The financial challenge of providing clean water to the residents of Spallumcheen has been eased somewhat.

Spallumcheen is to receive $3.8 million through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to support upgrades to water infrastructure in the North Okanagan community.

""Spallumcheen council is committed to providing a safe, reliable and secure supply of water for Township residents and this funding is a key step in helping us achieve this goal,"" said Acting Mayor Joe Van Tienhoven.

Spallumcheen has adopted a long-term water strategy and has identified many projects and required upgrades to ensure water sustainability.

""Water is so central to everything we do, and this funding announcement is a vote of confidence from the province and the federal government about the work our council is doing to help ensure we are planning for the long-term water needs of our community,"" said Van Tienhoven, adding the township has been focused for many years on improving the delivery of water services to its residents.

In a press release, Spallumcheen officials said a key component of the initiative has been the conversion of many of the independent water districts to township-managed services.

During the conversion process, many infrastructure deficiencies were identified that were related to water quality, supply and system reliability.

Spallumcheen council has developed a phased approach to address the deficiencies.

""We have to thank the funding program for the $3.8 million which will help ensure that our council is able to continue on our path to providing safe reliable water while ensuring we take a responsible approach to water management,"" said Van Tienhoven.",castanet.net,news,Castanet,Darren Handschuh,0.388235294117647,448934096,1,https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/3/screen_shot_2024-03-22_at_1.43.16_pm_p3774314.jpg,eng-9412856

Environmental Resources Management Sdn Bhd corporate sustainability and climate change consulting director for Malaysia and Brunei, Syed Fairul Al-Mashoor, said the new ventures in businesses and shift or potential expansion of the new value chain will ""definitely help in our embarking on the new GDP journey"".

He cited the example of electric vehicles, which conventional car-makers and suppliers initially believed would cause a consumption deficit as EVs have less wear and tear.

""But looking at the greener side of it, there will be a shift in terms of the education system where the syllabus needs to be updated and relevant, and more demand on training and hiring to upskill the people within the ecosystem.

""This is merely the tip of what the green economy can offer. The growth of EVs is dependent on energy companies providing alternative fuels and making them more accessible to the market.

""This will motivate energy and transport companies to expand their businesses and grow other revenue streams, leading to the creation of new jobs and thus accelerating the economy's circulation.

""This is just one example. Imagine other industries,"" Syed Fairul said.

He agrees that there is a need to initiate a skilling, upskilling, and reskilling approach throughout the workforce to ensure the green economy grows seamlessly.

Centre for Market Education chief executive Dr Carmelo Ferlito lauded the focus on the green economy, noting that new investment opportunities are always welcome.

However, he cautioned that for the green economy to be sustainable in the long run, it needs to be market-driven instead of government-driven.

""If what is produced by the green economy is either demanded by the market or the green economy itself can generate its own demand, then we can expect this new frontier to bring benefits to the country in terms of value and job creation.

""If, instead, the green economy is sustained by government intervention with support either on the demand or supply side, then it will generate a bubble,"" he said.

This bubble will then burst when the support, which he said is not sustainable, is withdrawn.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues convened a ""Fed Listens"" event to gather insights from business and community leaders regarding the effects of the Fed's interest rate hikes and persistent economic pressures on Americans.

Whitney Ferris-Hansen, owner of J/W Farms and Ranch in Burlington, Colorado, highlighted the challenges faced by American agriculturalists due to higher interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. She emphasized the difficulties in managing risk amidst the rapid pace of rate increases.

Since March 2022, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates to combat soaring inflation, maintaining the short-term benchmark rate at 5.25%-5.5% since last July.

The event aimed to provide central bankers with firsthand accounts of how their rate-setting decisions impact real-world scenarios.

Business leaders, including Cara Walton from Harbour Results in Southfield, Michigan, expressed concerns about rising borrowing costs, elevated energy prices, and slowing demand affecting small and medium-sized manufacturers.

Many have halted investments in new equipment due to affordability issues exacerbated by the current economic climate.

Derrick Chubbs, CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, highlighted the challenges posed by increasing costs across various sectors, including healthcare, childcare, transportation, and housing.

Despite a slowdown in the rate of inflation, economic pressures persist, impacting organizations like food banks that provide vital services to communities.

Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed, presented insights on labor market trends, noting a cooling trend, particularly in higher-paid sectors like technology.

While lower-wage job postings surged in 2021 and early 2022, growth has since decelerated, reflecting evolving dynamics in the job market.

West's letter to the music industry comes almost a month after he threatened to close down his Instagram account if the platform refused to change his handle to ""Ye.""

On Saturday, West's chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, sent out a letter demanding that the rapper's name, ""Ye,"" be respected by the music industry, streamers and publishers.

Yiannopoulos noted that the rapper's decision to drop the name ""Kanye West"" did not come easy and that he wants to enforce the change across all platforms.

""Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, on par with presidents and popes. He didn't take the decision to change his name, potentially sacrificing some of the immense value captured by the brand 'Kanye West,' lightly,"" the letter began, per TMZ. ""The change was made fully, legally, and permanently. This is who he is now. His name is Ye. We are reaching out to streaming platforms, publishers, stores, unions, lyrics websites and data resellers. This change will happen everywhere.""

It continued, ""Your platform has been identified as one of the most visible places this change may occur, and we passionately hope you will be able to fully and properly reflect the new name and identity of such an enormously influential and historic figure.""

In the lengthy and impassioned letter, the rapper's chief of staff, Yiannopoulos, stated that West has a right to ""full self-determination"" and added that the Yeezy founder has referred to his former name as his ""slave name"" on multiple occasions.

The letter read, ""He has on several occasions referred to it as his slave name. Ye is a black man in American who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else.""

""My colleagues and I are reaching out at his urging and hope you can assist in this effort by bringing any and all instances of his name into line on your services,"" the letter concluded.

The ""All of the Lights"" rapper announced in 2021 that he wants to be known as simply ""Ye,"" claiming at the time that it is ""the most commonly used word in the Bible. And in the Bible, it means, 'You.' I'm all of you.""

Since then, he has taken legal steps to enforce this change.

The letter from West's camp comes almost a month after the rapper took to his Instagram page, stating that he would shut it down if the platform refused to change his handle from ""@kanyewest"" to ""@ye.""

At the time, the 47-year-old shared a post of a chat between him and musician Justin LaBoy, which read: ""I'm closing my Kanye West Instagram account. My name is Ye. No brand or numbers gonna force me to call myself what they want me to still be.""

According to HipHopDx, the rapper initially captioned the post with a longer text: ""Somebody has Ye as an account. I would like to have my name so I can change my account to my legal name. Nobody finna bully nothing Not no promoters Not no DSPs I don't care. My name is Ye now. You call me Kanye West then you calling me out of my name.""

In a second post in February, the rapper shared another chat with his followers in which LaBoy assured him that Instagram was working on changing his official handle's name.

It read, ""Instagram has approved[...]They just got into the office and called immediately."" LaBoy added, ""Waiting on info they need to make it happen today.""

Less than 24 hours after, the name change was official.

The rapper also acknowledged the change, as he reshared a post on his Instagram Stories with the caption: ""Four. Three. Two. One. Who Am I? Ye. That's Ye Ye.""

While the rapper has been able to ensure his name change on Instagram, he still has X (formerly Twitter) to deal with.

According to a recent report, the ""Love Lockdown"" rapper was summoned to Australia by his wife, Bianca Censori's father, Leo, who has allegedly been concerned about his daughter's dressing since she married West.

""Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,"" a source told the Daily Mail.

The source added, ""Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye's power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.""

Censori's mother, Alexandra, also recently flew to the U.S. in a bid to ""save"" her daughter.

Alien: Romulus isn't going to be a CGI-fest.

Speaking about the upcoming film with THR, director Fede Álvarez commented on the movie's special effects. He shared how he'd brought in the same team who developed the Xenomorphs for James Cameron's Aliens to help craft the new creatures for Alien: Romulus. The filmmaker also addressed how spaceships were built and miniatures were used for the sets. That's not to say that there's no VFX in the film at all, but Álvarez suggested that it's only used as sparingly as possible, as the idea is for the audience to never pick up on it, taking them out of the movie.

Related Director Hints Alien: Romulus Will Be Scarier Than the First Alien Movie Director Fede Álvarez says Alien: Romulus will avoid the pitfalls of Ridley Scott's Alien by doubling down on the sheer horror of the slasher story.

""For the creatures, we brought in all the guys from Aliens,"" he said. ""They were in their early twenties when they made Aliens, and they were a part of Stan Winston's [special effects] team. And now we had them at the top of their game. They have their own shops, and so we brought them all together to work on all the creatures, because we went with all animatronics and puppets at every level. I even got the chance to be under the table with them, puppeteering all these animatronics.""

He added, ""I have this obsession with no green screens, so we built every creature and set. Everything had to be built so we were really living and breathing in these spaces. But I'm not an anti-CG guy... I come from a background where I know how to build the effects myself. I still do VFX shots in my movies to this day. I'll cut and do VFX shots on my computer, sometimes. So it's just whatever is best for the shot, and when it comes to face-to-face encounters and moments with creatures, nothing beats the real thing.""

Even without the VFX, Scott was able to get the ""whole experience"" of watching the movie, hinting at just how small of a part this plays in the project.

""There's some things that only CG can do for the scope and movement,"" he said. ""So it really has to be the right tool for the shot. Ideally, you should never feel like you're watching CG. Ideally, there should be nothing there where the audience goes, ""Well, that was clearly CG."" It should always feel practical, but I prefer practical because I want to see it when I'm there [on set]. There is nothing worse than having nothing to look at when I'm shooting. But some things that are CG can really blow your mind when done right.""

Fans will see how it all turned out when Alien: Romulus is released in theaters on Aug. 16, 2024.

That is primarily thanks to the lack of weathering forces and strong plate tectonics that disrupt the formations of such impacts on our home planet.

However, not all impact craters on Mars are directly caused by asteroid impacts. Many of them are caused by the ejecta from an asteroid impact falling back to the planet. One recent study showed how impactful this can be - it concludes that a single large impact crater on Mars created over two billion other smaller craters up to almost 2000 km away.

The study, released at the 55th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas, focuses on a crater called Corinto. It's located in Elysium Planitia, only about 17 degrees north of the Red Planet's equator.

It's a relatively young crater by Martian standards, with the scientists' best estimate of its age being around 2.34 million years ago. It's pretty massive for being that young, though, as the average time between impacts of its size is around 3 million years. As such, the scientists think it might be the most recent crater of its size on Mars.

That's not why it's interesting, though. It has an extensive ""ray system"". That means that a significant amount of ejecta was cast out from the impact site and landed elsewhere on the planet, creating ""rays"" from the central impact point that can be seen on a map of the planet's surface even today.

Corinto crater is about 14 km in diameter and 1 km deep. Its interior bowl is pock-marked with other, smaller craters that happened its impact. Indications suggest it was full of water ice when it was hit, as there appeared to be some degassing of the superheated ice after the impact. Calculations point to a relatively steep impact angle of about 30-45 degrees from straight on - and the impactor appeared to be coming from the north.

As a result, much of the ejecta impact field lies to the south, especially the southwest, of the crater. While some secondary ejecta craters are sitting to the north of the main one, it appears clear that the impactor's angle was significant enough to push most ejecta to the south.

Tracking the path of this ejecta a few million years later isn't easy. Scientists used data collected by HiRISE and the Context Camera (CTX) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and analyzed characteristics of smaller craters surrounding the main Corinto crater. In particular, they looked for craters that looked like they would be caused by ejecta rather than by an interplanetary impactor.

They grouped the different types of ejecta craters they found into five different ""facies,"" primarily focused on how far away they were from the main crater. Each facies has its distinct characteristics. For example, Facies 0, the one closest to the main crater, are semi-circular, don't appear to have any ejecta, or have very distinct rims. On the other hand, Facies 3 craters are long and narrow rather than semi-circular (hinting that something rolled through to create them) and have shown up as very bright in the MRO images.

Two main findings from the paper will probably turn the most heads. The scientists found that there are close to 2 billion secondary impact craters larger than 10 meters caused by the ejecta from Corinto. And those secondary craters appear up to 1850 km away. That would make it, by far, the most impactful (pun intended) of the recent Martian craters in terms of the sheer number and distance of its ejecta.

The paper didn't go into what that might mean for our larger understanding of these processes on the red planet, nor what future work might be completed - the version reviewed for this article was only two pages. But, as with most things in science, a new record for something - in this case, distance and amount of secondary impact craters, attracts additional research, so we'll have to see what if any, future discoveries can be made regarding this interesting Martian crater.",sciencealert.com,news,ScienceAlert,Universe Today,0.1843137254901961,448933031,1,https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/one-impact-on-mars-pro.jpeg,

Even with the drawbacks of such a model, I was instantly sold. I'll try to keep this review PG-13 or better, but the plain truth is that every time I travel now and the place we're staying at doesn't have a bidet, I feel unclean until I can retreat back home. The SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat is a feature-packed bidet worthy of any throne, at least on paper, and if it's elongated and/or a French Curve toilet. Our particular model is elongated, and the previous bidet I had on it was getting older and wasn't made for elongated toilets, making for a mismatch that the SmartBidet model should solve as well.

The SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat is a toilet seat with a built-in bidet. The electronics add a drying feature, hot water (without having to connect to a hot water pipe), a toilet seat warmer, night lighting, and a host of adjustments and controls via a wall-mountable remote control.

The SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat is a wedge-shaped seat, the taller portion at the back hides the hot water reservoir and other parts. This particular model is made to fit French Curve and elongated toilets.

At the top of the seat are some physical button controls and the logo. These would work in a pinch if the remote's batteries die, but you'll be using the wall-mounted remote for most controls.

The remote (pictured above) has controls for adjusting the nozzle position (forward and back), various cycles including ""posterior"" and ""feminine"", a dryer, and adjustments for water/dryer pressure, seat temperature, and water temperature, as well as an auto clean button. A small LED indicates if batteries are low (my last similar model had a remote as well, and batteries lasted over 3 years, so you shouldn't have to worry about this too often).

Pictured above is the nozzle itself in the retracted position. To the right of the nozzle is a flap that covers the dryer vent. By retracting the nozzle and having protection over the dryer, the bidet should survive even the most horrific toilet experiences.

The lid has quite a few warning and instruction items, and the seat and lid have rubber bumpers and close softly.

Finally, a removable sticker notifies you of the hidden skin sensor. This prevents your toddlers or pets from accidentally firing off the bidet if no one is actually on the throne,

To install the SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat, you'll first need to remove your old toilet seat. Then you'll place the bracket as shown above, and insert the two large bolts (with square heads). You can see above how it offers about 2 inches of forward and backward placement adjustment.

Next, the thumb washers are screwed onto the bolts from below (I recommend not tightening them too tight yet, you'll want to install the bidet itself later onto the bracket and then adjust it forward/backward before tightening).

You also need to install the 1/2'' compression T-valve, which adds a diversion of water from your toilet tank supply line to the bidet.

The bidet water supply hose screws onto this new connection.

And then onto the bidet itself. The bidet is installed onto the bracket by simply sliding it on (and it can be easily removed for cleaning later with the press of a button).

You'll also want to plan where to mount the remote control, right above the toilet paper holder was an obvious choice in this bathroom.

Once the plate is installed, you simply slide the remote on, and you're done!

Unless you get a leaky water supply hose, like the one included in my box with the SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat. It was leaking from the spot in the middle of the picture above, but luckily it was the same size as the water supply hose from my old bidet (and if it hadn't been I'm sure you could have found a replacement at a home supply store of your choice. Hopefully, SmartBidet's quality control catches these in the future (SmartBidet immediately followed up to say that they would happily replace a defective hose if needed).

The GIF above shows the bidet in action just in case you've never used or seen one. When you turn it on, there's a slight delay as the nozzle pokes out from its hidey-hole, then a nice gentle cool/warm/hot stream of water gives you a cleaning vastly superior to toilet paper.

The adjustments were plentiful: the positioning and pressure/temperature settings all did what you'd want them to do, and it seems like they'd accommodate a wide variety of people sizes. My only disappointment in the weeks of review was the weak dryer, even at high settings it seems like it takes a while to dry much at all, so I reverted to simply using a bit of toilet paper (literally a 10th of what I'd probably use for regular toilet visits, just a bit to dry off). The seat warmer is also great, if you're into that sort of thing.

The SmartBidet SB-2400ER Bidet Toilet Seat is now a permanent addition to my bathroom, and does everything I want it to and more. I'll update here if I run into any more issues, but it feels solid and well-built and I look forward to a lasting relationship with my SmartBidet Toilet Seat.",the-gadgeteer.com,news,The Gadgeteer,Matt Gregersen,0.2,448932698,1,https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SmartBidet-2400er-01.jpg,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to usher in a new age of productivity and performance in the investment industry.

With the recently acquired ability to understand and produce writing, speech and images, and the long-demonstrated power in predictively processing high-dimensional data in complex domains, AI-empowered systems have the potential to revolutionise every corner of the industry.

The firms able to position themselves to catch the most significant productivity wave since the internet revolution of the early 2000s will realise an order of magnitude step change in the efficiency and effectiveness of their processes.

The technology isn't a magic bullet, but its potential impact on the competitive landscape is immense.

The most successful firms won't simply deploy every bit of AI they can find. Rather, they'll need to carefully evaluate where and how to strategically apply these tools and technologies based on a considered understanding of the business and investment process implications.

Rezco has been investing heavily in our next-generation, AI-centred investment management tooling over the last six years through our partnership with Alis Exchange (recently featured by Google Cloud as a lighthouse case study for innovation in the industry).

Given the latest wave of interest in AI, we thought it would be a good time to share some of the thinking that underlies our AI strategy with clients and to invite commentary and debate on where others agree or differ in opinion.

Accelerators vs. Augmentors: Understanding different AI impacts

We can broadly divide AI-driven opportunities into two categories:

Process accelerators: These AI tools optimise processes by dramatically increasing the speed of the investment process. They don't necessarily do things better than humans but work at speeds far beyond human capabilities. A powerful language model can synthesise key investor opinions, earnings call transcripts, and research reports within seconds, giving a human analyst a substantial head start.

For example, it takes about 20-30 hours of detailed work (reading sell side, earnings calls, reports, prior coverage, market and news commentary) to synthesise a good ""key drivers"" and ""bull case/bear case consensus summary"". A decent LLM (large language model) can do that in 20-30 seconds.

Maybe it gets to a slightly worse end product, but it is 1/3000th of the time and effort. Investment managers are in the information processing business and the speed with which information needs to be processed to remain competitive in public markets is experiencing a step change.

Augmentors: Augmentor AI tools meaningfully improve a person's capabilities. Perhaps this could be AI that identifies unique anomalies in trading data hinting at potential fraud or software that recommends portfolio rebalancing based on highly complex risk considerations.

Augmentors elevate human skills.

We're already using AI to materially augment the sophistication of our global equity screening process. The old style of taking a week to build a model and produce a report, post earning updates is struggling in a world where a lot of the alpha can happen in the pre-market after an earnings announcement.

In global equity, the traditional long-only style is struggling to compete against passives on the one hand and massively resourced pod shops on the other. Good AI models are able to find the patterns in the data and help PMs react quickly. But this is just the beginning; the complexity will grow exponentially, so the gaps between the early and late adopters will increase.

Rethinking investment analysts

Analysts will need to adapt. AI's information processing abilities could render traditional analysts' jobs obsolete. Instead, analysts of the future will need to showcase stronger critical thinking, problem-solving, and synthesis skills.

The goal becomes less about information production and more about leveraging insights - a shift more closely aligned with a portfolio manager's traditional role. The fear of AI-caused job losses is natural, but we need to focus on the competitive edge.

Firms shouldn't simply fear AI but rather fear falling behind those who are harnessing it powerfully.

Embracing (but not blindly accepting) AI

A valid and common criticism of AI tools is, ""it's a black box"" or to hear managers espouse the ""explainability"" value of simple Machine Learning 1.0 models.

ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW

Having said that, there are probably only ten people in the world who really understand the inner workings of frontier foundational models such as GPT-4, and this doesn't stop it from being really useful to millions of users. Tools like ChatGPT are impressive, but it's vital to use these powerful black boxes intelligently.

It's tempting to fully trust output, but the key is learning by doing. The more we interact with AI models, the better we understand their capabilities and limitations. Verification of AI-produced work remains essential.

Invest in your foundation: Data and digitisation

Catching the AI wave requires having something to ride. Like the internet revolution before it, firms need to have the data and digitisation foundation in place to capitalise on the AI opportunity or risk being left helplessly paddling in a vain attempt to play catch up.

In the funds industry, laying the data and digitisation foundation for AI is a particularly acute challenge. Data moves through the fund's ecosystem in a flood of disparate data formats, definitions, and templates. These PDFs, Excel files, emails and CSVs settle within the inscrutable crevices of SharePoints, server drives and email mailboxes like the accumulating detritus of a hoarder's basement.

Might an honest investment professional's job description read, ""Help wanted. Experience tracking down and

manually transposing data.""

To truly make the most of AI, we can't ignore the prerequisite work. Firms need clean, structured, and well-managed data as the building blocks for AI to be helpful.

Today, too much valuable data exists in messy formats like PDFs and emails, hidden and scattered within the digital workplace. Data management and digitisation investments are just as crucial as deploying the fanciest AI toolsets. Commentators on the ""Pod Shop"" world often talk about the high systems and technology barriers to entry to be able to compete.

From learning investing 'on the job' to AI fund management

Is the AI story priced for perfection?

Our thesis is that having a coherent and well-executed digitisation and data strategy will similarly become table stakes for managers moving into an AI world.

The question isn't ""Have you spent millions on alt-data?"" but whether you can effectively create a digitised manifestation of your investment process that enables the seamless collaboration of people with AI systems.

Conclusion

AI's ability to generate text, speech, and images will change the way investment funds work. Firms that thoughtfully prepare will unlock powerful productivity gains.

Just as the internet revolutionised industries, AI is poised to do the same for those who plan strategically. This isn't just about cutting costs. It's about increasing capabilities, and the most proactive firms will find an unmatched competitive advantage in the years to come.

Apart from leaving commuters to travel in run-down, non-AC buses, this is also causing financial losses to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

The NMC pays ₹74.12/km for diesel-run standard buses, and ₹50.93/km for electric AC buses.

The 80 buses are part of the 144 electric AC buses procured through PMI Electro Mobility Solutions Private Limited, a Haryana-based company, from funds released by state govt's 15th Finance Commission. The firm was to deliver all the buses, and set up necessary charging facilities by December 2023.

""It has been over a month since these buses are lying unused,"" admitted a senior official from NMC's transport department. The official said the firm is developing a depot in Wathoda area of south Nagpur.

Sources, however, pointed out that it will take a couple of months for the depot to become operational. Until then, the firm will not be able to roll out all the AC buses on city roads. The official added that the firm is set to complete the delivery of the remaining buses soon.

Another official said that the registration of many buses supplied by PMI is still not complete. This is also one of the reasons behind the buses lying unused.

The Haryana-based PMI not only failed to deliver the buses but also set up charging stations on time. Till date, the firm has delivered 109 buses, of which 80 are lying unused for lack of charging facilities. Sources said that PMI has not set up even a single charging station so far. Also, it is yet to deliver the remaining 35 buses.

As per contract, PMI is to install 22 charging points at Wathoda depot and six at Mor Bhavan bus stand. Of the 109 AC e-buses delivered by PMI, only 29 are in operation thanks to four charging points at Lakadganj set up by EVEYTRANS, another private firm engaged by NMC.

The buses provided by EVEYTRANS are charged at Wadi depot where it has set up 20 charging points. The 40 air-conditioned electric buses provided by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) are charged at its Hingna depot that has 15 charging points. The existing charging points are insufficient against the fleet of 195 electric buses, a source said.

NMC has a fleet of 627 Aapli Buses, of which it operates around 420 on over 100 routes. The fleet has around 237 standard buses, which will go off-road this year.

This was urged by experts during a webinar titled ""Renewable Energy: Pursuing Clean Energy Solutions for Pakistan"", organised by Global Neighbourhood for Media Innovation in collaboration with the United States Department of State.

The online moot discussed the role of renewable energy in combating climate change as Pakistan is still majorly dependent on fossil fuels for the daily operation.

The speakers highlighted the use of renewable energy in mitigating climate change, reducing carbon footprints, and charting a course toward energy autonomy.

The event was moderated by environmental journalist Afia Salam. She emphasized the media's role in disseminating climate change awareness.

Salam presented a view of the environmental issues, stressing that policymakers must adopt cohesive strategies within the Pakistani context.

Providing insights into Pakistan's energy generation portfolio, Zehra Aneek, an expert on energy sustainability and corporate governance, said that the country heavily relied on fossil fuels, which account for 60 percent of total energy consumption.

She elucidated the challenges in infrastructure development for renewable energy transmission and installation by citing policy barriers such as the ""solar tax"", which disincentivizes the adoption of renewable energy sources to the public.

Echoing these sentiments, Mohsin Babbar, a media person, shed light on the economic repercussions of Pakistan's energy import bills and circular debt. He emphasized the need for broadening the climate change discourse beyond urban elites to engage local communities actively.

Babbar highlighted the role of political parties, media, and digital influencers in promoting awareness and advocacy for renewable energy solutions.

Nida Farid, an aerospace engineer, said that it was important to educate the public about energy conservation in reducing utility bills and promoting energy-efficient appliances.

She underlined the necessity of dispelling misconceptions surrounding energy among policymakers to facilitate effective decision-making.

The webinar emphasized the necessity of policy frameworks that support renewable energy adoption without acting as barriers.

The discussion highlighted solar energy as a viable solution for mitigating climate change consequences and called for collective action towards a cleaner, safer environment for future generations.",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,0.3019607843137255,448932471,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-03-24/l_1171714_035553_updates.jpg,eng-9415511

According to principal Jennifer Hanna, there are three staff members and two students known to still be in the hospital as of midday Saturday. There are nine students whose families the school is still trying to contact for updates. For staff members, one is expected to be released soon and two will have much more extensive recoveries ahead. Of the two students in the hospital for whom there is an update, both ""appear to be doing well"" and remain primarily for observation prior to their anticipated releases in the near future.

Tom Green has canceled school for Monday, May 25, however, the school will be open for students and staff members who want to seek counseling services on a voluntary basis. The campus will have specialized crisis and trauma counselors available to help from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Students who need transportation to attend counseling may call the school to coordinate ride services. The normal school schedule will resume on Tuesday, March 26.

""In the days and weeks ahead, we will face a long road of healing and recovery. Let us come together to provide comfort and solace to one another, offering a shoulder to lean on and listening ear for those who need it most. During this time, I encourage each and every one of you to prioritize self-care and seek support if needed,"" Hanna said.

According to Hays CISD Public Information Officer Tim Savoy, the bus involved in the accident was not equipped with seatbelts. The district began buying buses with seatbelts in 2017, when the state law changed for buses purchased in that year and later, but the bus involved was a 2011 model.

""The district hopes that the DPS accident reconstruction investigation will be able to provide more information about whether a seatbelt may have made a difference for the student who died in the accident, but at this time we just don't know that answer,"" Savoy said.

About 40 of Hays CISD's 200 buses are older than 2017, meaning they do not have seatbelts. According to Savoy, this will be a topic discussed with the district's Facilities and Bond Oversight Committee in consideration of potentially accelerating the normal Hays CISD bus replacement cycle so that all buses have seatbelts as soon as possible.

The school board meeting scheduled for Monday, March 25, 2024, has been canceled ""to allow staff who would ordinarily be preparing materials for the meeting to attend to needs supporting the Tom Green campus."" The meeting will be rescheduled for a later date yet to be announced.

For those wanting to help, a former Tom Green Elementary teacher, Molly Andrews, who is a community member and member of the Tom Green Elementary School Campus Leadership Team, has set up a GoFundMe account. The money raised will be used to help students and staff with expenses related to healing, off-setting funeral expenses for the student who passed away and other unexpected expenses incurred by families affected by the accident.

Additionally, the Hays Education Association TSTA has set up a meal train for the family of the boy who was killed in the accident. It can be found at https://bit.ly/4cvlpL2.

Regarding personal belongings left on the bus or lost at the crash site, the campus will be working directly with those on the bus to return personal belongings, including cell phones, as soon as possible.

Hanna concluded, ""As we mourn the loss of our student and support those who are injured, let us remember the strength of our community and the bonds that unite us. Together, we will find the strength to heal. Together, we are Hornet strong.""",haysfreepress.com,news,Hays Free Press | News-Dispatch,Ashley Kontnier,-0.04313725490196074,448932222,1,https://www.haysfreepress.com/haysfreepress/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/432994419_914237870706047_8209613384662395511_n-1024x1024.jpg,eng-9418925

Concerns raised about project narratives not matching technologies. Founder behaviors and token manipulation threaten market integrity.

The world of cryptocurrency has faced events in the past two years that require us to rethink dangerous trends in the industry. Emin Gün Sirer's recent statements carry critical warnings. In particular, the SBF scandal brings to the fore many issues that need to be questioned before assuming the innocence of crypto projects and their leaders.

SBF was seen as one of the popular figures in the crypto world. However, as Emin Gün Sirer emphasizes, appearances can be deceptive. SBF's true intentions and activities point to many dangers that worry the crypto community.

Firstly, Emin Gün Sirer points out the mismatch between project narratives and their technologies. Centralized sequencers and the absence of fraud proofs in Layer-2s contradict crypto ideals. Are these types of projects really operational, or are they just selling hot air?

Additionally, the practice of projects currently selling tokens to raise money for a technology switch in the future is concerning. Such practices could be contrary to legal regulations and expose investors to serious risks.

The issue of founders dumping their personal tokens before launch is also critical. Keeping team members locked and managed transparently is important according to Sirer. Otherwise, investor confidence can be shaken, and crypto projects can lose their reputation.

Token value depreciation and manipulation are also worrying. Some actors can serve their own interests by playing games with low-value tokens and borrowing against them. Such manipulations can threaten market integrity. Lastly, founders complaining about personal pleasures can be an ethical discussion point. This situation can also indicate a lack of seriousness in project management.

Ways to Prevent Such Corruption

According to Emin Gün Sirer, there is a simple test to cut through this noise and identify what truly matters. Recently, scalability and performance issues were among the prominent problems in the crypto world. Sirer notes that platforms like Avalanche and Solana have emerged to address these issues. However, Sirer emphasizes that instead of focusing only on specific use cases, these solutions should be usable in a broader scope.

Sirer questions whether crypto projects truly bring a game-changing approach to addressing prominent issues when evaluating them. For a project to be truly significant, its owners need to be in a unique position to solve these problems and be able to clearly demonstrate this.

However, with Sirer's warning, many projects in the crypto world can easily emerge that could be deemed as trash. Sirer points out that a new group of people is lining up to fill the void left by prominent figure Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), which could affect developments in the sector.
