Despite boasting one of the oldest working markets in the country, it is accepted that there has been a slow decline in Earlestown town centre and St Helens Council successfully bid for £20m from the government's Levelling Up Fund in order to address this.

The council has also committed to a further £8m to support the regeneration project, which is planned to redevelop the town's market square, refurbish the town hall, and improve the town's railway station.

However, although Earlestown businesses have been crying out for investment in recent years, market traders are not convinced that the regeneration project will deliver the transformational change that developers say it will, with some having strong aversions to certain aspects of the plans.

On a relatively busy Friday morning - but nowhere near as busy as the market has been in years gone by, as traders tell me - the main issue raised was the parking and vehicle access under the new market plans.

At present, every trader has their vehicle next to their stall so they can quickly unload their products, re-stock if necessary, and quickly pack up at the end of the day. Some traders, such as the butchers and fishmongers, work inside their vans as they keep stock refrigerated.

However, under the council's detailed planning application that was submitted earlier this month, there are more restrictions regarding vehicle access as council planners believe there is a ""lack of structure"" as to how traders currently access and park in the square.

With a new all-weather canopy set to provide space for 60 traders, planning documents state how access will be ""controlled through vehicle restraints including raised planters, seating blocks, street trees, built elements, fixed bollards, and manually removable bollards"".

The plans suggest that there will also be space for 40 outdoor traders, with the vehicle restrictions intended to provide ""greater opportunities for the square to feel and operate as a secure and flexible space"".

Concrete seating blocks will also be installed to ""avoid vehicle access to the market canopy"", with the council believing that a lack of parking structure has prevented the market from operating as a ""safe and inviting space"".

The council says that it is ""committed to making sure traders can easily park in the vicinity of the market"", and is exploring options such as designated parking areas for stall-holders alongside facilities for disabled people.

However, it has not yet been confirmed where these potential parking areas may be.

Dennis Lyon, who runs a pillow and quilt stall, has worked on Earlestown market for 29 years and is one of the square's traders who doesn't have a market cover.

In a sentiment shared by many traders in Earlestown, Dennis said: ""If [the council] removes vehicle access, half the traders will go.""

""I work out of my van, as do all the traders here, and I'm here to make money.

""I don't want to be running back and forth to my van all day to restock my products when I could be losing business, or I could have my products nicked or be at the mercy of the elements.""

Many other traders raised the same issue, including Lynne Coltas, a Fleetwood fishmonger whose family business 'Syd's Fisheries' has been operating at Earlestown market for the past 50 years.

Lynne said: ""Almost everybody works by themselves here so how can you keep a stall running if you're constantly going back to restock?

""If you ask any trader here, parking and vehicle access will be their biggest concern, and I know some traders who have left and others who are looking elsewhere because of this.""

Like Lynne at Syd's Fisheries, Jade and Mark at A&R Meats also need their van to refrigerate their stock.

One of the busier stalls on the market, Mark suggested he will fight to ensure vehicle access is part of the plans as they ""make too much money not to have [their van] here"".

Jade suggested that they may need to go elsewhere if permanent vehicle access is not an option.

Other concerns raised by traders include a perceived lack of communication with the council regarding the regeneration plans, as well as the current state of the market.

Bob and Mark Isherwood, a father and son whose family flower stall has been on Earlestown market for 100 years, said: ""The market is fairly busy but it's nothing to what it once was.

""This used to be our flagship stall but now it's one of the most difficult stalls we travel to. The market isn't maintained well and it hasn't had any proper advertising for years.

""We both said that the vehicle and parking [restrictions] wouldn't work from the get-go, but [the council] hasn't listened. There is limited parking around the square now so where are all these traders going to park?""

The market is nowhere near as it used to be, traders say (Image: St Helens Star)

As traditional markets have had to battle with the rise of supermarkets, online shopping, retail parks, and more recently the pandemic and cost of living crisis, it can be argued that it is inevitable that many traders have struggled and this isn't a case specific to Earlestown.

However, there are certain market areas quoted to be thriving, such as Bury and Chorley market, and some traders feel that there is a discrepancy in how these markets and Earlestown have been run.

Em and Kay Barlow, whose clothes stall has operated in Earlestown for the best part of 30 years, said: ""We work at different market stalls, as other traders do, and it feels at many of these you are supported and the council works with you.

""Unfortunately, it feels like St Helens Council is working against you at times.

""We have very limited communication with them and receive a leaflet of the plans every now and again. I've worked here for 30 years so why wouldn't you come and ask me what I'd like to see?

""Half of the market coverings are falling to pieces and some don't have any at all. We have bought our own gazebo but we are provided one at other markets.

""We do work at some markets where there is no vehicle access, such as in Liverpool (Great Homer Street), so this could potentially work.

""But the business is so busy there that it makes up for it. We're also supported by the council and parking is around the corner so it isn't too bad.""

Similarly, Valu Bentley, a Kiwi baker, said that he isn't convinced about the council's regeneration plans and added that he has also had limited communication about the future of the markets.

This reported lack of communication is something that was also raised by independent councillors in the area last month, who said they had hit a ""wall of silence"" after asking for updates and queries about the regeneration plans.

In response, the council said that ward members have been ""briefed at every step of the process"", although there are not always answers until key planning milestones are reached.

Some elements of the plans may not initially be released publicly if it is commercially sensitive, a spokesperson added.

The council also points to the series of consultations held in Newton and Earlestown last year as evidence of listening to public concerns, with more than 240 people said to have given feedback.

Obviously, with £28m being invested in Earlestown and lots of hard work going on behind the scenes, the council and developers believe that the regeneration plans will ""transform the area back into a thriving and bustling market town"".

The council also aims to utilise the square as more than just a market space, with plans to install play areas, safe spaces to relax, and the potential to hold special events.

The feedback from the public consultations is also reported to have had 80% of people in favour of the proposed market canopy, with 73% of respondents believing that the plans would benefit the town.

68% said that they were likely to spend more time in Earlestown as a result.

However, after speaking to several market traders, there seems to be more apprehension than positivity, and more pessimism as opposed to optimism.

In addition to the vehicle and parking concerns, traders criticised the proposals to demolish the current public toilet building and move this off-site.

There was also criticism that the canopy is not planned to be installed along the Market Street side of the square, which some believe could attract more passing trade, as well as concerns about increasing market rates and what will happen to traders when construction of the canopy begins.

With Earlestown possessing such a historical market, all of the traders are in agreement that it is in dire need of investment if it is to survive.

However, the jury is still out as to whether these multi-million pound plans will be the answer that traders are looking for.

In response to questions from the Star, a spokesperson for St Helens Council and ECF, said: ""Our proposals will provide a better environment for traders and shoppers, helping to support and grow Earlestown's historic market long into the future and encouraging more people to spend time in the town centre through the ability to host events all year round.

""There is currently a lack of structure to how traders access and park in the square, which does not help to create a safe and inviting space.

""The square will benefit from controlled vehicle access at its four corners, including secure bollards with ample loading space for market traders.

""We are committed to making sure traders can easily park in the vicinity of the market and we continue to consider a range of options for this, providing further updates as options progress.

""This could include designated areas for stall-holder parking and servicing alongside facilities for disabled persons, to create a safer and more vibrant Market Square.

""The Market Square's current use for indiscriminate public parking on non-market days does not create a welcoming environment and is not sustainable.

""A comprehensive, parking survey is taking place as part of the planning process to assess the suitability of existing facilities across the town centre and inform the development of a parking strategy to ensure Earlestown has an appropriate and fit-for purpose operational parking estate. Stakeholders will be engaged to help inform this parking strategy.

""The council reviews fees and charges each year for all services, including its markets, with updates to the council's webpages on an annual basis, and we'll continue to do so.""",warringtonguardian.co.uk,news,"Warrington Guardian - news, sport, Wolves, info, cars, jobs and homes in Warrington, Cheshire.",,0.192156862745098,448989173,1,https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17891624/,

An underground gas storage site in Ukraine has been hit in the recent wave of Russian missile strikes on power facilities, Ukraine's state-run Naftogaz energy firm said on Sunday, but it said natural gas supplies to consumers have been unaffected. The energy ministry and distributors said Ukraine ramped up imports of electricity and halted exports on Sunday after the recent series of Russian attacks, in which top energy producer DTEK lost 50% of its capacity.

Russia attacked Ukrainian generating and transmission facilities on Friday, causing significant blackouts in many regions, and energy facilities in three Ukrainian regions were also attacked on Sunday morning. But Naftogaz said it was keeping up with customer demand.

""All nominations of customers for storage and capacity booking services continue to be fulfilled in full,"" its CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov said in a statement. The energy ministry said in a statement: ""For the current day, electricity imports are forecast at 14,900 megawatt hour (Mwh). No exports are expected.""

Ukraine imported 3,300 Mwh a day before the attack on March 22, with exports of 2,148 Mwh. ""Losses (from Friday's attack) have already been assessed and the DTEK group has lost 50% of its generating capacity, we can say this information officially,"" the head of distribution firm Yasno, Serhiy Kovalenko, said on national television.

He gave no more details. DTEK is Ukraine's largest private power-generating company. Kovalenko said Russia had attacked two parts of the energy system - generation and distribution, hitting both thermal and hydropower plants.

""The enemy hit hard at grid nodes and transformers,"" he said. The ministry said that on Sunday Russia had attempted to hit a critical energy infrastructure facility in the Lviv region in western Ukraine.

""Equipment caught fire and the facility was de-energised. There were no casualties. The consequences are being assessed,"" the ministry said. It said that as a result power lines in the Kyiv region were damaged and 1,400 households in two settlements had lost power.

Naftogaz's Chernyshov said his company was currently working on localising and eliminating the impact of the Russian attacks. ""There are no critical consequences for the operation of the (underground) storage facilities, as the gas is at a considerable depth. The damaged part of the ground infrastructure will need to be restored, but we have sufficient backup capacities,"" he said.

The layoffs for one of America's biggest automakers become effective on March 31 and are white-collar jobs largely at the company's headquarters and a chemical center in Auburn Hills, Michigan, covering engineering, technology and software roles, Stellantis told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Stellantis has so far waited to bring its electric offerings to market, avoiding heavy sales losses accrued by competitors like Ford, which lost $4.7 billion on EVs in 2023.

""As the auto industry continues to face unprecedented uncertainties and heightened competitive pressures around the world, Stellantis continues to make the appropriate structural decisions across the enterprise to improve efficiency and optimize our cost structure,"" Stellantis told the DCNF. ""While we understand this is difficult news, these actions will better align resources while preserving the critical skills needed to protect our competitive advantage as we remain laser focused on implementing our EV product offensive and our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.""

Stellantis has previously said that it plans to have 100% of sales in Europe be electric and 50% of sales in the U.S. be electric by 2030. The layoffs represent just 2% of the company's engineering, technology and software roles, Stellantis told the DCNF.

Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis, has previously said that EVs currently cost around 40% more to make than traditional vehicles and that the company is looking for ways to bring costs down, according to The Associated Press. The automaker plans to launch 18 new EV models this year but notes that the prices are not where Stellantis would like them to be.

Stellantis announced in December that it could be laying off thousands of employees from plants in Detroit and Ohio as it adjusts production to comply with environmental regulations in California. The mandated standards in California require cars in the state to have fewer emissions, coercing automakers into hastening a transition to EVs.

The Biden administration is also pushing for an expedited EV transition, imposing harsh limits over the next decade on tailpipe emissions. On Wednesday, regulators rolled back the timeline slightly for the next few years on emission restrictions, giving automakers more time to create their EV line-up, but did not change their final goal of requiring around 67% of all light-duty vehicles sold after 2023 to be EVs or hybrids.

This burn had been previously documented and approved by the FLOKI DAO, with the plan outlined for completion that same week.

Following the burn, FLOKI's price decreased by 20.10%, falling from $0.00024 to $0.00019 in less than ten days. This negative performance has led some analysts to predict a further fall to $0.00010 by mid-April.

However, not all experts share this pessimism. Some analysts, citing signals from technical indicators, are positive of a potential rise in FLOKI's value, predicting a rise to $0.00030 by the end of the month.

On March 11, NFT Now announced the winners of Optimism's We Love Art contest, generating excitement within the Optimism community. However, despite the positive buzz, the price of OP took a slight downturn. At the time of the announcement, OP traded at $4.585, but a few days later, it had fallen to $3.304, reflecting a 24.66% decrease in value.

This minor price dip for the DeFi coin hasn't deterred all experts. Some remain optimistic about Optimism's future due to the ongoing bullish trend in the broader crypto market. Consequently, they forecast a significant rise for OP, predicting it will surge to $6.722 by the end of April.

On the other hand, not all analysts share this bullish sentiment. Some experts, citing recent technical indicators, maintain a negative outlook for Optimism. They predict a further decline for OP, projecting a drop to $2.814 within the next two weeks.

This is despite a concoction of higher commodity prices, logistical constraints in SA and persistent supply challenges presenting challenges for the group in 2023.

""The company believes that the best approach for growth in our industrial business is to consider promising acquisition opportunities while progressing potential organic growth opportunities in our existing transition metals portfolio,"" group chair Kalidas Madhavpeddi said in the company's most recent annual report.

Glencore has in recent years modified its portfolio towards commodities that are essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy and global energy needs as society pushes for a sustainable future.

Glencore's exposure to assets that produce fossil fuels relates mainly to its coal mining operations in Australia, SA and Colombia and its Astron oil refining asset in SA.

The group said it was increasingly confident of its strategy as energy transition commodities such as copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, vanadium and aluminium have been touted to become substantially more important given their roles in the technologies and infrastructure that underpin low- or no-carbon energy sources.

Glencore has thus been investing in transition commodities, including its South American copper assets and projects, its African copper and cobalt operations, the Kazakhstan polymetallic and Brazilian bauxite and alumina investments alongside its Canadian INO nickel life-extension projects.

""We acquired a 30% equity stake in the Alunorte alumina operation in Brazil alongside a 45% equity stake in Mineracão Rio do Norte."" said Madhavpeddi. ""Further, we continued our efforts to develop a leading pipeline of development opportunities in copper, acquiring the remaining interest in the Mara brownfield copper project in Argentina, as well as the balance of the shares in PolyMet.""

Multiyear reset

In copper, Glencore acquired the remaining 56.25% interest in the Mara project that it did not already own, as well as the balance of PolyMet shares, about 18%.

CEO Gary Nagle said these copper acquisitions complemented the multiyear reset of Glencore's copper business unit to prepare it for growth.

""We have disposed of noncore assets and sought to align around large, long-life, low-cost resources in key copper-producing regions,"" said Nagle. ""Crucially, our copper portfolio offers capital-efficient growth possibilities, with most of our copper projects leveraging existing infrastructure.""

Glencore said that in 2023 SA exports through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal were affected by rail performance. However, transporting additional volumes by truck to ports helped shore up overall annual exports from SA by 5%.

The group stated that coal production of 113.6-million tonnes was 3% higher than in 2022, reflecting higher productivity in SA and a year-on-year easing in certain external factors that constrained capacity, such as wet weather and blockades.

Demand

Nagle said that while investing in its transition metals portfolio, Glencore believed that the likely scale and pace of global mine project development required in certain minerals would ultimately struggle to meet the commodity demand that the transition was expected to generate.

However, he said Glencore was well placed to participate in ""bridging this gap in supply"" through the flexibility that exists in the business to respond to global needs, while the expected interest rate cuts would ease the pressure.

""The strength of our diversified business model across industrial and marketing, focusing on metals and energy, has proved itself adept in a range of market conditions, giving us a solid foundation to successfully navigate the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as meet the resource needs of the future,"" he said.

""Though the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, global economic growth is forecast to bottom out in 2024.

As part of the regulatory approval process relating to the 2019 acquisition of a 75% shareholding in Astron Energy, Glencore and Astron Energy entered into certain commitments with the Competition Tribunal and the economic development department.

These commitments included investment expenditure of as much as R6.5bn until 2024 to ease congestion and improve the performance of the Cape Town oil refinery, contribute to the rebranding of certain retail sites and establish a development fund to support small and black-owned businesses in Astron Energy's value chain.

In November Glencore announced it had acquired a 77% effective interest in the entirety of Teck's steelmaking coal business, Elk Valley Resources (EVR), for $6.93bn cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to a normalised level of working capital.

On completion, the announced acquisition of EVR should lift Glencore's steelmaking coal production to about 30-million tonnes a year.

Madhavpeddi said the acquisition unlocked the potential, subject to shareholder approval, for a value-accretive demerger of its combined coal and carbon steel materials business.

""We will undertake a consultation process after the close of the transaction to assess shareholder views,"" he added.

Glencore said it could demerge the combined company only once it had sufficiently deleveraged towards a revised $5bn net debt cap, adding that this was expected to occur within 24 months from close.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could fall to its early 2024 lows as the market slide worsens. XRP has also recorded a sharp decline from the $0.70 region.

Bitcoin Cash's (BCH) decline has worsened amid Bitcoin's continued drop. Despite being one of the bullish altcoins at the start of the month, Bitcoin Cash has been severely affected by the market decline. Investor sentiment for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has fallen, causing a drop below its early-March high of $500.

BCH traded at $265.47 on February 20. It soared by 88.6% to a high of $500.81 on March 2. BCH fell by 13.2% to $434.32 on March 12 before a 17.2% decline to $359.24 on March 19.

Bitcoin Cash's (BCH) halving is a few weeks away. Details of the halving show that Bitcoin Cash block rewards will drop to 3.125 BCH. Market experts say investors could increase their Bitcoin Cash (BCH) holdings in anticipation of a rally. This could push BCH's value up by 41.8% to $509.54.

XRP, the embattled payment token, has suffered a sharp decline after joining the market rally of early March. Bitcoin had soared, triggering demand for many cryptocurrencies. Despite high volatility, XRP became one of the top altcoins. However, on-chain reports show that XRP's market capitalization has since fallen by $7 billion in March.

As of February 20, XRP traded at $0.5629. It jumped by 6.9% to $0.6019 on March 1. XRP remained bullish, rising by 19.2% to $0.7180 on March 11. However, XRP dropped by 18.6% to $0.5844 on March 19.

Analysts predict a continued XRP decline due to its ongoing problems with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The courts are yet to decide the extent of XRP's violation of securities law and how much fines it should pay.

Whatever the case, analysts predict that XRP will jump when the court troubles are over. This could push XRP's value up by 24.5% to $0.7280. Still, analysts say XRP is not a good crypto to buy now.

It killed three sailors in an attack earlier this month.

The U.S. has stepped up efforts to counter this threat, including carrying out airstrikes and sanctioning the group as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity.

At the same time, the U.S. government, which has provided more than $5.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, continues to bankroll humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and United Nations agencies in Yemen that are largely exempt from the sanctions. This contradictory policy allows the terror group to divert aid and benefit from these funds, exacerbating an already major security crisis.

In 2021, the Trump administration designated the Houthis, officially known as Ansarallah, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, but the decision was rescinded shortly after Joe Biden took office. However, in January of this year, following increasing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, the State Department applied to Ansarallah the ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"" label and imposed accompanying sanctions.

But in published guidelines for navigating these sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control includes major loopholes that undercut the sanctions' purpose. The document states that NGOs are able to make payments to Houthi officials and institutions -- as well as institutions controlled by Houthi officials -- as long as these payments are for taxes, administrative fees, permits, public services or licenses. This is done ostensibly in the context of humanitarian assistance. With the Houthis controlling ports and other infrastructure and jurisdictions in Yemen, this means that NGOs can openly pass money to the terrorist group, as long as it is labeled as a tax or fee.

In addition, the document allows U.S.-funded NGOs to ""coordinate with Ansarallah [the Houthis] regarding the transfer or distribution of humanitarian goods."" NGOs are also permitted to make payments to agencies and organizations led by Houthi officials; fund development projects that could be used by government institutions under direct Houthi control; and disburse ""payments (e.g., cash incentives, per diems, and expenses) directly to healthcare workers, teachers, and other staff who may be associated with or formally employed by purported or actual administrative agencies or governing institutions controlled by Ansarallah.""

These broad exemptions effectively render the sanctions regime worthless and embolden the Houthis. They also reflect years of campaigning by U.S.-funded NGOs that work to reduce anti-terror vetting standards and champion engagement with terrorist organizations.

Central among these is the Norwegian Refugee Council, which lists USAID as a funder of its Yemen operations, and which condemned both the Trump and Biden administrations for their respective designations of the Houthis.

NRC, whose annual budget totals over $600 million, and has received more than $320 million in U.S. grants since 2020, has long lobbied the U.S. government and other donors to allow it to coordinate with designated terror groups. For instance, in a 2020 ""toolkit"" designed to train other NGO officials, NRC asserts that ""engaging with non-state armed groups, regardless of whether they are [designated terror groups], is a key element of gaining and maintaining secure access to people in need.""

The NRC has lobbied the U.S. in other ways, as well. In 2020, it successfully forced USAID -- the primary U.S. government agency for foreign aid distribution -- to narrow its anti-terror vetting, including vetting of secondary partners.

Another NGO of concern receiving US funding for Yemen is Norwegian People's Aid, which is getting $1.1 million from the State Department between August 2023 and September 2024. In April 2018, NPA settled a civil fraud case with the Justice Department and USAID, in which the NGO was accused of providing material support to the Iranian military and Palestinian terror groups, including Hamas.

Likewise, NRC and its officials have advocated for direct Hamas involvement in aid distribution in Gaza. The terrorist organization has a history of looting aid for its own purposes, storing weapons in humanitarian facilities and planting terror members in positions in aid organizations.

Policymakers have drawn connections between the lax policies promoted by NGOs and the potential for aid diversion. In a February Senate hearing Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) cautioned, ""I think about what Hamas has done with the aid we've sent to Gaza, and I'm deeply concerned that the Houthis may, as well, divert the aid that we're sending.""

Governments that want to responsibly deliver humanitarian aid in conflict zones must learn lessons from Yemen and Gaza. This includes stricter enforcement of laws forbidding provision of material support to terrorist organizations, particularly when these groups are in active combat against U.S. forces, as with the Houthis.

In addition, NGOs seeking American taxpayer funds and any ultimate beneficiaries of U.S. assistance must be vetted to ensure that they are not linked to US-designated terrorist organizations. This vetting must rely on all publicly available information -- including publications and statements made by potential grantees, implementing partners, or beneficiaries, and their officials.

Only by instituting stricter policies can the U.S. ensure that taxpayer funds do not line the pockets of terror groups threatening the U.S. and its allies.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,-0.3568627450980392,448988491,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/International-Houthis-AP24014524802614.jpg?strip=1&w=640,

The workshop particularly focused on how to remain resilient to changing weather conditions. Caribbean countries were encouraged to develop methods for dealing with changing climatic conditions.

David Farell, Principal of the Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, recently addressed a regional workshop regarding climate change. The theme of the event was ""National Frameworks for Climate Services in the Caribbean"".

The event held at Accra Beach Resort was concerned with the dynamics of climate change. The workshop particularly focused on how to remain resilient to changing weather conditions. Caribbean countries were encouraged to develop methods for dealing with changing climatic conditions.

Developing climate resilience is the need of the hour, as it means developing methods that can help us sustain various aspects of life, such as agriculture, despite climate changes.

David Farrell outlined the importance of collaborating with the government, NGOs, and other climate enthusiasts to aid preparation for natural disasters. Although talks about the national framework for climate change started over a decade ago, there is plenty of work to be done.

Principal Farrell expressed his appreciation for what has been achieved so far. However, he also showed concerns for not being further in the process of implementation of climate services in the region.

He stressed that they need to take more measures nationally. This will help build resilience to climate variability in countries all across the region. He appealed for collaboration with financial sector to help with challenges caused by drought in Panama Canal.

Furthermore, he emphasized the need to develop national-level solutions for the concern as this will reduce dependency on CIMH. He suggested studying the economic structures and building services in accordance with the same.

This workshop was of utmost importance as Dr Van Meerback predicted Caribbean countries are expecting hotter temperatures this coming summer. The CIMH climatologist also expects more severe hurricanes and tropical cyclones. UN weather agency has issued a Red Alert on climate change as ice melt has increased in 2023.

Many observers of American politics are understandably terrified at the prospect of Donald Trump being re-elected president of the United States in November.

The US is already showing signs of a failed democracy. Its government and politics are often dysfunctional and plagued with corruption.

A Trump victory would raise fears of a new level of decline into fascist authoritarianism. However, a second Trump presidency would not necessarily implement a foreign policy any more destructive than what is normal for the US.

Since the start of the 21st century, the US has unleashed enormous violence and instability on the global stage. This is a feature of American foreign policy, regardless of who's president.

In 2001, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the US launched its ""war on terror."" It invaded and occupied Afghanistan, then illegally invaded and occupied Iraq.

These actions caused the deaths of 4.6 million people over the next 20 years, destabilised the Middle East and caused massive refugee migrations.

In 2007-2008, the under-regulated US economy caused a global financial crisis. The associated political and economic fallout continues to resonate.

In 2011, the US and its Nato allies intervened in Libya, collapsing that state, destabilising northern Africa and creating more refugees.

The US tried to consolidate its dominance in Europe by expanding Nato, despite Russia warning against this for decades. This strategy played a role in the Russia-Ukraine war in 2014 and the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

President Joe Biden's administration has been accused both of helping to provoke the war in the hopes of permanently weakening Russia and of resisting peace negotiations.

Today, Ukraine appears to stand on the verge of defeat and territorial division, and US Congress seems set to abandon it.

The US has provoked tensions with China by reneging on American commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act (1979) to refrain from having official relations or an ""alliance"" with Taiwan. The US has also been accused of encouraging conflict in the South China Sea as it has surrounded China with hundreds of military bases.

Israel's assault on Gaza is partly the culmination of decades of misguided US foreign policy. Unconditional American support of Israel has helped enable the country's degeneration into what human rights organisations have called apartheid, as the state has built illegal settlements on Palestinian land and violently suppressed Palestinian self-determination.

As Israel is accused of using starvation as a weapon against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, the US is fully complicit in the Israeli war crimes and for facilitating a conflict that is further inflaming a critically important region.

Israel is of little to no strategic value to the US. American politicians contend that its overwhelming support for Israel reflects moral and cultural ties, but it's mainly driven by domestic politics.

That suggests that for domestic political reasons, the US has endangered global stability and supported atrocities.

The Biden administration has continued many of the foreign policy initiatives it inherited from Trump.

Biden doubled down on Trump's economic, technological and political war against China.

He reinforced Trump's trade protectionism and left the World Trade Organisation hobbled.

He built on Trump's 'Abraham Accords', an initiative to convince Arab states to normalise their relations with Israel without a resolution to the Palestine question.

The Biden administration's efforts to push normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel is considered part of Hamas' motivation to attack Israel on October 7, 2023.

None of this inspires confidence in US ""global leadership.""

Biden and Trump share the same goal: permanent American global domination. They only differ in how to achieve this.

Trump believes the US can use economic and military might to coerce the world into acquiescing to American desires, regardless of the costs to everyone else and without the US assuming any obligations to others.

In office, Trump tried to present himself as ""anti-war."" But his inclination to use of threats and violence reflected established American behaviour.

Biden follows a more diplomatic strategy that tries to control international institutions and convince key states their interests are best served by accepting and co-operating with American domination. However, Biden readily resorts to economic and military coercion, too.

The silver lining to a Trump presidency is that it might force US allies to confront reality.

American allies convinced themselves that the Biden presidency was a return to normalcy, but they're still accepting and supporting American global violence. They're also wilfully ignoring the ongoing American political decay that could not be masked by Biden's defeat of Trump in 2020.

Trump is a symptom of American political dysfunction, not a cause. Even if he loses in November, the Republican Party will continue its slide towards fascism and American politics will remain toxic.

A second Trump presidency may convince American allies that the US is unreliable and inconsistent. It may undermine the mostly western coalition that has dominated and damaged the world so profoundly.

If Trump returns, traditional US allies may recognise that their interests lie in reconsidering their relations with the US.

For American neighbours Canada and Mexico, a Trump presidency is only bad news. They'll have to somehow protect themselves from creeping US fascism. For the rest of the world, it may herald the start of a dynamic multipolar order.

During a recent appearance on the ""Just Baseball Fans"" show, Walker Buehler said he wants to see a smoother transition for players going from the WBC to the regular season:

""I think we need to make that an easier transition for guys. Because I think guys trying to play in that and then the regular season is really, really tough. I wish we could have a global-level event more often that's not detrimental to players at all.""

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred already announced that the next WBC will take place in March 2026. The tournament is being held one year earlier to avoid a potential conflict with the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) set to expire after the 2026 season.

Another concern with the WBC is the rise in injuries among players who participate in the tournament. New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz sustained a complete tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee while celebrating a Team Puerto Rico win that required season-ending surgery.

In November, the company had announced the demerger of its transmission business into a separate entity. In an interview, Agarwal said the company is awaiting the approval for the demerger from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and expects the process to be completed by the second quarter of FY25.

""The most suitable business for the public markets is our manufacturing business. There are multiple listed players in that space -- some are in B2B, some in B2C -- and some are capitalizing on the Indian growth story. We are also riding a global growth wave, with 50% of our business coming from exports. We have 40 customers across the US, Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Australia. So, it is very suitable. Post-demerger, we will evaluate all fundraising options,"" he added.

""We have no urgency, but we will certainly evaluate all options. If the markets are favourable and, depending on investor interest, we will surely consider a listing of the manufacturing business.""

The company is also considering expanding its existing manufacturing facilities in India, besides setting up a new facility, Agarwal said. ""The total investment for expansion (both brownfield and greenfield) should be in the range of ₹350-400 crore.""

The manufacturing business is projected to grow 20-30% in FY25, buoyed by the around ₹2 trillion worth of central sector transmission projects in India.

The company is also in talks with private equity investors for raising funds for its transmission business, he said. ""That is the business where we operate like a highway operator, where we build, own and operate transmission lines, providing transmission services to end users, generators, and consumers. That business is growing very, very fast. And then we're looking at closing a large transaction with a very large investor, which we hope to finalize soon.""

The company's transmission division also operates in Brazil. It boasts a portfolio of 30 completed and ongoing projects, totaling around 14,602 circuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines across India and Brazil. It is focussing on consolidating its presence further in India's transmission sector.

Agrawal, the chairman of SPTL subsidiary Serentica Renewables, said the company is furthering its ambitions in the round-the-clock renewable energy solutions. ""At Serentica, we aim to provide round-the-clock renewable energy solutions to large factories by selling renewable power. These large-scale, energy-intensive factories currently rely on thermal power consumption. Our goal is to replace 15-50% of their thermal power with renewable power.""

""Currently, one of the most interesting opportunities in the whole decarbonization space is how to replace carbon consumption of these large factories, which are responsible for consuming 80% of greenhouse gases worldwide, with renewables,"" he said.

""We will certainly deploy batteries across our fleet in different shapes, forms, and sizes. Additionally, we will explore alternative forms of storage, whether owned by us, or by a third party, and then contracted to us.""

On 20 March, Mint reported that Serentica was planning to sell a minority stake to raise around $300 million to fund its ambitious growth plans.

Studies have shown that 25% of coral reefs around the world have already disappeared due to warming waters, pollution, ocean acidification and overfishing. As natural coral reefs face unprecedented threats, the urgent need for sustainable solutions has never been clearer.

InnoTech, a pioneering company at the forefront of environmental technology, has ventured into the realm of artificial coral reefs using 3D production technology, heralding a new era in marine ecosystem restoration.

The genesis of the company's foray into artificial coral reefs lies in the recognition of the dire state of natural reefs globally. As these vital ecosystems deteriorate, the need for innovative rehabilitation methods becomes increasingly pressing.

Othman al Mandhari, CEO of InnoTech, shared the company's motivation behind this endeavour: ""We saw a critical gap in coral reef restoration efforts and realised the transformative potential of 3D printing technology in creating sustainable solutions for marine ecosystems.""

The 3D printed artificial coral reefs are meticulously designed to mimic the intricate structures of natural coral formations, providing essential habitats for marine life and bolstering coastal resilience.

Through customised design features tailored to specific ecological requirements, the company ensures that the artificial reefs seamlessly integrate with the surrounding marine environment, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. The adoption of eco-friendly materials further underscores the company's commitment to sustainability in marine conservation.

The artificial coral reefs are being created through cutting-edge 3D production techniques. This process begins with designing a digital model using specialised software to mimic natural coral formations. Printing materials, such as a specialised concrete mix, are prepared for underwater use.

The 3D printing process involves depositing layers of concrete to build the reef structure with high precision and intricate details. After printing, the structure undergoes a curing process to ensure durability underwater. Once completed, the reef is deployed in the ocean for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to promote habitat colonisation and long-term success.

3D printed artificial coral reef can be produced in just 8 hours per piece, compared to traditional methods that take 36 hours.

Transforming fishermen's lives through artificial reefs

The impact of the artificial coral reefs extends beyond ecological restoration -- it is also transforming the livelihoods of local communities, particularly fishermen who rely on healthy marine ecosystems for their sustenance.

Hatem al Mansoori, a local fisherman from Sur, shared with the Oman Observer his experience on the artificial coral reefs: ""Since the installation of the artificial coral reefs off the coast of Oman, our fishing yields have seen a remarkable increase. The reefs attract a diverse array of marine species, providing abundant fishing grounds for us.""

The success stories from fishermen like Hatem underscore the tangible benefits of artificial reefs in enhancing fish populations and marine biodiversity. By creating thriving ecosystems that support robust fish stocks, the artificial reefs serve as sustainable solutions for addressing overfishing and habitat degradation, ultimately ensuring the long-term viability of fisheries.

Environmental conservation through innovation

InnoTech's commitment to environmental conservation extends beyond artificial coral reefs, encompassing a holistic approach to marine ecosystem preservation. Through strategic collaborations with marine biology organisations and conservation groups, the company seeks to leverage its innovative technologies for broader conservation initiatives, fostering synergy between scientific research and technological innovation.

In an interview with the Oman Observer, Fatma al Harbi, a marine biologist at Marine Science and Fisheries Centre Oman said, ""The creation of artificial reefs in the sea favours biological productivity, therefore enhancing the population of fish and invertebrates.

These reefs have the power to attract marine life by offering a habitat. They not only constitute a shelter but are also a valuable reproduction reservoir, which can recreate a whole ecosystem in biological depleted zones.""

""These 3D printed structures not only provide essential habitats for marine organisms but also contribute to the overall resilience of coral reef ecosystems. The intricate designs and bio-inspired features of the reefs promote biodiversity and ecological connectivity, enriching the marine environment,"" she said.

""Researches at Sultan Qaboos University have shown the efficiency of using artificial coral reefs in Oman where the abundance and the biomass of fish has increased,"" she added.

Looking ahead, the future of marine conservation holds a myriad of possibilities for InnoTech and its innovative 3D production technology.

Driven by a steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship, the company is poised to explore new frontiers in artificial reef design and deployment, with a focus on scalability and effectiveness in ecosystem restoration. Approximately 14,000 artificial coral reef have been placed in 154 different locations in Oman.

Al Mandhari shared his vision for the future of artificial coral reefs: ""Our goal is to expand the reach of our 3D printed reefs to new marine habitats worldwide, catalysing a wave of positive change for marine ecosystems.

Through sustained innovation and collaboration, we aim to forge a legacy of environmental conservation that transcends borders and generations.""

InnoTech's pioneering efforts in 3D printed artificial coral reefs epitomise a paradigm shift in marine conservation, ushering in a new era of sustainable ecosystem restoration. By combining cutting-edge technology with a commitment to environmental stewardship, the company is paving the way for a brighter and more resilient future for our oceans and the communities that depend on them.",omanobserver.om,news,Oman Observer,Jomar Mendoza,0.2078431372549019,448987418,1,https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/600x600/2615749.jpg,eng-9414196

The NYPD is reportedly considering AI technology that would enable cameras to notify law enforcement when a gun is drawn on the city's subways.

Gun-detection AI aims to inform police ""before that first shot is fired,"" according to Sam Alaimo, one of the co-founders of ZeroEyes, a company that deploys the software in public spaces around the country.

The Philadelphia-based firm is training an algorithm to identify weapons once they are drawn. The program integrates with the current digital cameras used by transport systems, government organizations, and educational institutions, among others. Then, according to corporate officials, analysts keep an eye on blank screens that don't activate until firearms are found - notifying law enforcement immediately if they think the object is a weapon.

""From the moment that gun is seen in front of a security camera within about three to five seconds, the end user, the school, subway, the military base, the shopping mall, the grocery store, will get that alert,"" Alaimo said, as reported by the New York Post. Officers will also get ""a picture of the shooter, the exact location of the shooter and the exact time the shooter was there.""

NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry told NY1 that the tech might be one way to stop weapons in the wake of the shooting on an A train in Brooklyn last week. ""I'm looking at technology where we can use our current cameras in the actual subway system and integrate that with technology where we can detect weapons,"" Daughtry said.

However, researchers studying the city's subway have found ""very few occasions in which you can actually get a visual on a singular entity exempted from sleepy stations during sleepy hours,"" according to Santa Clara University's Noah McClain.

Expressing his satisfaction, Aregbe stated that all repairs and renovations on the facility, including the Walkway, have been finalized, ensuring its accessibility for tourism activities during the upcoming Easter celebration.

Aregbe took the opportunity to extend gratitude to Lagosians and tourists worldwide for their patience during the thorough maintenance works conducted at the Centre. The completion of the maintenance signifies a significant milestone in preserving and enhancing the tourism potential of the Lekki Conservation Centre.

Prof. Mathew Onoja, the Director-General of the Centre, also expressed appreciation to the State Government for its intervention, particularly in response to a viral video that circulated in December. He commended the swift efforts made towards repairing and renovating the Centre, acknowledging its importance as a major tourism asset in Lagos State.

Highlighting the Centre's significance, Onoja emphasized its role as a popular destination for tourists from around the globe. He noted that the Centre offers a serene environment conducive to nature tourism and boasts the longest canopy walkway in Africa, attracting visitors seeking unique outdoor experiences.

The routine maintenance of the facility commenced in January, prompted by concerns arising from a damaged section of the Canopy Walkway which led to its closure. Although repairs had been undertaken before the circulation of the viral video on social media platforms, the State Government's proactive response ensured the completion of comprehensive maintenance works to uphold safety standards and enhance visitor experiences.

Initially, the management of LCC also issued a press statement stating that the center has been closed for maintenance and will be reopened on February 1, 2024.

Established in 1990, the center spans 78 hectares (190 acres) and serves as a vital natural resource conservation area. Originally conceived as a biodiversity conservation icon, the facility's current state raises concerns about its ability to fulfill its intended purpose.

With the Walkway accessible once again, visitors can look forward to exploring the diverse ecosystems and scenic beauty of this renowned conservation area.",nairametrics.com,news,Nairametrics,Deborah Dan-Awoh,0.4901960784313726,448986988,1,https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lekki-Conservation-Centre-e1706036853587.jpg,

After conducting the initial incredibly successful massive drone strike on the Russian oil refineries one week ago, Ukrainians discovered that the Russian air defense performed quite poorly and continued exploiting the holes in the sky by hitting even more refineries.

The success of the strikes was noted even by the Russian media, which started estimating the drop in production level to be double digits.

Some Western media sources even claimed that the US asked Ukraine not to proceed with the strikes for fear of the surge in global oil prices.

These strikes, in combination with persisting incursions into the Kursk and Belgorod regions, especially during the elections, prompted a corresponding reaction from the Russian forces.

That is why Russian forces launched the largest series of combined drone and missile strikes targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure since the start of the full-scale invasion.

However, it is important to note that the actual goal of this strike is the opposite of what it seems and threatens to collapse the whole eastern front line.

At first glance, it seems like Russians are trying to achieve the political goal of showing the Russian public the power with which Russian forces retaliated to the so-called Ukrainian audacity.

A superficial analysis may indicate that another, more important goal of the Russian forces is to collapse the Ukrainian power grid and create significant logistical problems and societal discontent.

However, first of all, Ukrainian forces have adapted to constant shutdowns by engaging diesel locomotives and shifting their reliance to generators and Starlink during the previous Russian anti-energy infrastructure campaign.

Secondly, it turned out that Ukrainian people are prone to blame Russians for the shutdowns instead of the Ukrainian military or government for their inability to provide full protection, as everyone is aware of air defense shortages.

The real goal of Russian forces is to force Ukrainians to relocate their air defense away from the contact line.

As you know, one of the most decisive factors in the Battle for Avdiivka was the extensive use of air-dropped bombs. At times, Russians were dropping up to one hundred bombs per day, completely wiping out whole districts of Avdiivka.

Ukrainians simply did not have enough air defense systems to protect all areas of the front line and the deep rear simultaneously, which is why Ukrainians created mobile air defense units that could suddenly appear in any region and intercept three to five aircraft at once.

The approach worked well, and Russians started suffering tremendous losses in aviation - more than a dozen in ten days. This was arranged too late to be able to save Avdiivka, and the Ukrainians had to withdraw. On the other hand, it was timely enough to prevent the collapse of the front line.

Even though Russian forces continue dropping FAB-five-hundred air-dropped bombs every day, the rate at which they are bombing the region is not enough to undermine the Ukrainian defense and overwhelm Ukrainians in a particular sector.

Russian commanders understand that without establishing air superiority, Russian forces will spend months on small incremental tactical gains.

Since Ukrainians finally launched a large-scale initiative to build thousands of kilometers of new defense lines along the entire border and front line, Ukrainians seem to be building defenses faster than Russians are breaching them.

The Russian commanders fear that such a setting will lead to decades-long war, ensuring the exhaustion even of the Russian manpower and equipment pool.

That is why Russian commanders are trying to implement the Soviet Deep Battle theory.

In short, Russians are trying to breach defenses faster than Ukrainians are building them, and in current realities, it is impossible without establishing at least localized air superiority.

To achieve air superiority, at least near the contact line, Russians need to force Ukrainians to relocate their air defense away from the front line.

One of the ways to achieve that is to launch constant missile and drone strikes on the Ukrainian critical energy infrastructure.

Even though, as mentioned previously, Ukrainian forces and people can survive the shutdowns in the short- to medium-term, allowing Russians to wipe out all Ukrainian critical infrastructure will degrade Ukrainian defense industrial capacity in the long run. Given the ever-decreasing Western support, Ukrainians will not be able to continue to fight without developing their military-industrial complex. So, protecting critical infrastructure is extremely important for achieving long-term objectives.

The first target of the Russian strike became Kharkiv. Russia hit three three-hundred-thirty kilovolt substations and three thermal power plants here. This resulted in over eight hours of power outage in the whole region.

The second target became the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant, which suffered hits to the central and western parts of the machine hall, causing fires and damaging more than two hydro units, technological pipelines, auxiliary equipment, and one generator transformer.

The list of targets is long, as the Ukrainian officials stated that Russian forces targeted 136 energy facilities in 10 Ukrainian provinces. Notably, Russians tried to hit all Thermal Power Plants. Russian military analysts are pointing out that open distribution facilities at Nuclear Power Plants were not hit and that without cutting off power from them, it is impossible to collapse the Ukrainian grid.

Overall, Russian forces are exploiting the shortages of air defense systems and rockets by trying to create a dilemma for Ukrainian forces: if Ukrainians secure the air around the critical infrastructure, Russians will intensify bombardments along the contact line and start penetrating Ukrainian defense lines, and if Ukrainians secure the air along the contact line, Russians will target the critical energy infrastructure, which will undermine Ukrainian defense industrial base, especially the production of much-needed drones and shells.

However, Ukrainians will likely adapt again by improving the management of their air defense resources, especially the newly created mobile units. Russians have been accumulating stockpiles of missiles for almost a year, so if they exhaust their stockpiles without collapsing, the Ukrainian power grid and mobile air defense units can provide sufficient protection of the contact line. Then Russian forces will fail to implement the Soviet Deep Battle theory.

Hopefully, Ukrainians can also count on Western support and boost their air defense capabilities even more.",euromaidanpress.com,news,Euromaidan Press,Maria Tril,-0.1372549019607843,448986654,1,http://img.youtube.com/vi/Qgpx4cYO-qM/maxresdefault.jpg,

However, according to Ray Youssef, CEO of the financial communication and P2P application NoOnes, government restrictions aimed at stifling the introduction of a free market on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms could make it difficult for the services they provide to gain momentum. A recent report by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed changes to the rules that guide platforms offering crypto services.

ContentsA Noteworthy Move in NigeriaNigeria and the Crypto Industry A Noteworthy Move in Nigeria

According to the development, it was proposed to increase the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira, worth $18,620, to 150 million naira, worth $93,000. Speaking on the matter, Youssef, the co-founder and former CEO of the now-shuttered P2P exchange Paxful, said the increase is an invitation for big crypto companies like Coinbase and others to operate in the Nigerian market.

The government aims to restrict P2P services to address foreign exchange issues and emphasized that exchanges willing to forgo P2P support could operate smoothly in Nigeria. However, this strategy conflicts with the Nigerian crypto market's strong preference for P2P services and poses a significant barrier for exchanges. Nevertheless, Youssef remains optimistic about Nigeria's chances to maintain its position in the ecosystem despite the latest regulatory challenges.

Youssef said the government could use the abundance of P2P investors in Nigeria as an asset and act as an ally to crypto stakeholders to understand how to use crypto to the benefit of the country's economy.

Nigeria and the Crypto Industry

Nigeria is currently the world's largest P2P crypto market, a status that emerged after the Central Bank of Nigeria banned institutions from buying and selling crypto in 2021. In December 2023, the Nigerian government lifted the 2021 crypto ban, allowing crypto exchanges to apply for licenses in Nigeria.

Commenting on the recent partnership between Gluwa and the Nigerian government to enhance the adoption of the country's Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) eNaira, Youssef said the government could adopt a different approach while promoting CBDC to stimulate local economic growth, provide credit to enthusiastic entrepreneurs, and encourage the younger generation to embrace it.

The Nigerian government frequently clashes with crypto exchanges. Binance suspended operations with the naira on March 8th following the government's criticisms of crypto exchanges in February. In August 2022, Nigeria was named the world's most crypto-focused country based on the number of Google searches for cryptocurrency or crypto purchases.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Prime Minister Jakobsdóttir outlined her vision, emphasizing the importance of enhancing food independence and establishing a broader grid for renewable energy distribution across households and industries.

The country is known for producing copious amounts of energy from its network of hydroelectric and geothermal plants and stands as the world's largest energy producer per capita. This has propelled it into a leading position in Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate production.

Estimates from Bitcoin mining services provider Luxor indicate that the Icelandic Bitcoin mining industry devours approximately 120 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

With a population of just 370,000, the volcanic island stands out as the most Bitcoin-mining-dense country worldwide, attracting miners seeking optimal conditions for their operations.

However, despite this accolade, Jakobsdóttir's strategic shift, aimed at bolstering food production and enhancing energy sustainability, signals a departure from Iceland's crypto-centric energy focus towards a more diversified and sustainable approach, where fields of corn take precedence over the hum of crypto mining rigs.

The Prime Minister's decision is not only driven by concerns over energy sustainability but also by practical considerations. Iceland's reliance on imported corn has been highlighted as a vulnerability, particularly during power shortages in winter, forcing some industries to resort to non-renewable energy sources.

Jakobsdóttir deems this reliance on imports unacceptable and aims to rectify it by fostering domestic corn cultivation through a proposed farm funding system.

Currently, Iceland produces a mere 1% of its grain and 43% of its vegetables domestically, underscoring the need for agricultural development to enhance food security and reduce dependency on imports.

Iceland's rethink of its crypto mining space comes amidst reports that Bitcoin miners are ramping up their investments in equipment and consuming record-breaking amounts of energy in readiness for the upcoming Bitcoin halving slated for sometime in April.

At the same time, the Canadian province of British Columbia is reinforcing a 2022 moratorium to manage its electricity supply in the face of growing demands from Bitcoin miners.

Thanks to a British Columbia Supreme Court judge, the province will continue to ban any new crypto mining concern, based on the potentially significant impact such operations may have on its energy resources.",crypto.news,news,crypto.news,"Julius Mutunkei, Anthony Patrick",0.3098039215686275,448986118,1,https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-Cloud-Mining-Platform04.jpg,eng-9421751

These 2 Recession Indicators Point to Yes. | The Motley Fool,"Despite a soaring stock market, some economists still believe a recession is on the way.

Just two months ago, the new bull market became official.

The S&P 500 closed at a new all-time high of 4,839.81 on Jan. 19, and the broad market index has continued to rally since then, up more than 10% year to date at recent prices.

Investors have fully embraced the new bull market, driven by the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) and expectations that interest rates will come down, according to the Federal Reserve's own forecast. Falling interest rates tend to grease the economy by making it easier to borrow, which helps a wide range of industries, including real estate, autos, and banking.

However, despite the seeming euphoria in the market, some economists are still convinced we're headed for a recession. In fact, two closely watched indicators are both pointing toward a recession. Let's take a look at each one and examine their implications for the economy and the stock market.

If you follow the stock market, you've probably heard about the inversion of the yield curve. This happens when long-term bond interest rates are lower than short-term ones.

Typically, interest rates go up as bond maturities go longer, as investors require greater compensation to hold fixed-income assets for a longer period of time. The yield curve tends to invert when investors expect interest rates to come down in the near term, which generally happens when the Federal Reserve cuts the benchmark fed funds rate to try to avert a recession or at least cushion the blow. In 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates faster than it had in nearly 40 years to cool off the hottest inflation the U.S. had seen since the 1980s. That led to a bear market, the yield curve inversion, and sweeping recession forecasts.

An inversion of the yield curve, typically measured by the difference between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield, has accurately predicted a recession every time it's occurred since 1966. On that occasion, GDP fell sharply, but the economy did not enter a recession.

The 2/10 yield curve has been inverted since July 2022, and the gap has widened in recent weeks, as the chart below shows.

Based on that gap, it's clear investors still expect the Fed to cut rates, and that typically happens because of a weakening economy.

Another popular recession indicator that appears to be on the verge of flashing red is the Sahm rule. Created by former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, this rule says that if the three-month average unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points off the lowest reading within a year, the economy is headed for a recession.

In February, the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% in spite of strong job growth, and that was up half a percentage point from the 3.4% reading last April. While the three-month average has not yet reached the point that would signal a recession, it's clearly nearing it based on February's reading. A high March reading, for example, could trigger the rule by tipping the three-month-average above the threshold.

The Sahm rule has predicted every recession in modern U.S. history, as increases in the unemployment rate tend to portend sharp job losses as a recession hits. The chart below shows how upticks in the unemployment rate have coincided with recessions.

In investing, saying ""this time is different"" is something of a trap. Fundamental rules of economics and investor behavior tend to repeat themselves, leading to asset bubbles and prices and valuations reverting to the mean. But there are a number of reasons to believe that the economy can escape a recession despite what the above indicators say.

First, we're already near the longest period of time from the start of a yield inversion to the beginning of a recession, dating back to at least 1978, showing the yield curve indicator has not been as responsive this time around as it has been historically.

Additionally, the yield curve typically inverts when investors anticipate the economy softening. In this case, it inverted during a bear market because the Fed raised rates to cool inflation. That's an important difference from the recent historical pattern, and it adds noise to the indicator's predictability.

Regarding the Sahm rule, the unemployment rate is still historically low at less than 4%, and there's a lot of noise in the data because the labor force has shrunk because of the pandemic. Just as important, job growth remains strong, indicating that the labor market is still robust. Sahm herself made it clear that her rule had not been triggered, stressing the importance of following the three-month average.

There are other reasons to believe that the economy could continue to expand. The AI boom has sparked a new race in the tech sector and beyond, with funding for new tech infrastructure and a surge in hiring for related roles. Consumer sentiment has been rising since mid-2022, whereas it typically declines ahead of a recession, and the new bull market also indicates economic optimism in spite of recessionary predictions.

Given the length of time the economy has bucked the yield curve indicator and the fact that the unemployment rate is still low, I think the economy will skate past a recession.

However, whatever happens, investors should remember that recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, and that there's still a risk of one happening, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell reminded us in December.

It's also worth remembering that the U.S. stock market has recovered from every recession in its history, including the Great Depression, the Global Financial Crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic. That should help give you confidence to keep investing, no matter what happens in the near term.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Jeremy Bowman,0.03529411764705892,448986042,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/769913/stock-market-chart.jpg,eng-9421769

Dividend investing is one of the prominent ways to build wealth. Whether you are building a retirement portfolio, want to leave a legacy, or are looking to use the dividend income to cover your expenses, the right dividend stocks can make it possible. However, not all dividend stocks are the same. They can provide regular income but you need to ensure this income is consistent. This is why it makes sense to invest in companies that have a record of paying steady dividends. Consistency and stability are the two things you need to watch out for. Let's take a look at the seven dividend stocks you should buy with every dip. With an improvement in the economy, we can expect these companies to offer dividend hikes throughout 2024.

If you are hungry for a high dividend yield, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a great stock to own. With a dividend yield of 5.42%, the company could benefit from the rate cuts. One big reason to own the stock is the solid fundamentals. It reported a free cash flow of $ 7.7 billion in 2023.

Rio Tinto has a dividend payout ratio of 80%, which is better than several companies today. It has recently announced an investment in the lithium industry. The company will invest $350 million in Argentina for a lithium project and this could be a massive opportunity for it to cash in on the hot asset.

It has committed to an annual capital investment of $7 billion between 2024 and 2026 and this will pay off in the long-term. With inflation receding, Rio Tinto will see a drop in operating costs and we could see another dividend hike.

With a dividend yield of 1.24%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) enjoys a strong presence in the tech industry. The company reported impressive financials and beat estimates. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Oracle is set to see higher growth in the coming years. It has a dividend payout ratio of 35% and considering the earnings potential, it can easily increase the payouts.

In the fourth quarter, its cloud services saw a 45% increase in sales to hit $4.1 billion and it has robust guidance for the year. Trading at $129, the stock is up 23% year-to-date (YTD) and increased 46% in the year.

The company has been around for a long time and is rapidly building new data centers to meet the growing demand. For the current quarter, it is expecting earnings in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share. The management is aiming for sales of $65 billion by 2026.

There is an AI backlog and Oracle is making the most of the momentum. This is one stock that will not only generate passive income but also show capital gains in the next two years. It is a pure-play tech stock with the ability to reward investors significantly.

A dividend aristocrat, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has raised its dividend payouts for 41 consecutive years. The oil and gas company is a key player in the industry and it will make significant cash flow driven by the oil prices at over $80 a barrel.

The company did not cut dividends even during the pandemic and enjoys a yield of 3.35%. It has a dividend payout ratio of 41% which shows that the dividend is sustainable and there is scope for an increase. The oil company generated $55.4 billion of cash flow in 2023 and distributed $32.4 billion to the shareholders.

It declared a quarterly dividend of 95 cents per share which looks attractive for XOM stock trading at $113. The stock is up 10% YTD but any dip is worth buying. The elections and electric vehicle adoption could have an impact on the stock but I believe Exxon Mobil is relevant right now and has a long way to go.

One of the biggest industry players, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) enjoys a strong global presence, pricing power and brand loyalty. The demand for caffeinated beverages is expected to increase as summer approaches and I believe this will help the stock.

Multiple price hikes have impacted the sales but I think the company is done with the hikes and the slowdown in sales could be temporary. PepsiCo has a dividend yield of 2.93% and the stock is trading at $172. The company has increased dividend payouts for 52 consecutive years and this speaks about its commitment to reward shareholders.

The stock has also grown 42% over the past five years. The management expects to see a 4% rise in organic revenue this year. PepsiCo has a diversified business which shields it from the market movement and is highly relevant in the current environment.

PepsiCo is growing in international markets and is one passive income stock that wouldn't disappoint.

A top healthcare stock, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a dividend yield of 3.06% and has been increasing dividend payouts for more than 50 years. Having spun off the consumer products division, Johnson & Johnson is in a good position to see revenue growth driven by medical devices and innovative medicine.

The company saw a 7.3% rise in sales in the recent quarter where the pharmaceutical division surged 4.2% while the medical devices segment grew 13.3%. It enjoys stellar cash flow and has enough liquidity to keep rewarding shareholders.

It is one of the fastest-growing biotech companies with a strong pipeline of drugs and management expects to see annual growth between 5% to 7% between 2025 to 2030. Trading at $155 today, the stock is moving in the range of $145 to $162 and is at a discount right now. This is one stock to load up on whenever the market dips.

Your favorite burger joint is a dividend-paying company. A dividend aristocrat, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has hiked dividends consecutively for 49 years and enjoys a yield of 2.36%. Trading at $283 today, the stock is down 4% YTD. It hit $300 in January but has dropped since then.

The food giant has a global presence and enjoys a competitive advantage in the industry. The company has a franchise business model which helps keep operating costs down and generates steady cash flow. It offers affordable meals which helped it thrive during the inflationary period. Lower prices, implementation of AI and menu innovation can help attract customers and we could see an improvement in sales.

It saw an 8% YOY rise in net sales and a 3.4% rise in the same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Fundamentally, MCD is a strong company with the ability to rebound from the recent slip. Looking at the company's history and global presence, the stock looks highly undervalued to me.

Trading at $60 today, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoys a dividend yield of 3.21% and is one of the top companies globally. It has a strong presence in the beverages industry and is diversifying into healthy drinks to meet the changing needs of consumers. A dividend aristocrat, Coca-Cola believes in rewarding shareholders and has increased dividends for over 60 years.

With Coca-Cola, do not expect any immediate upside because the stock has been moving sideways over the past few months. However, it will bring stability to any portfolio and generate passive income for you. In the recent quarter, it announced a dividend of 49 cents per share. A cultural phenomenon, Coca-Cola has over 200 drink options and caters to every age group.

It saw a 6% YOY rise in revenue in 2023 and the operating cash flow hit $11.6 billion. The company is well-positioned for growth and could see an improvement in sales during the months of summer. With a dividend payout ratio of 76%, KO stock is one of the best dividend stocks out there.",investorplace.com,news,InvestorPlace,Vandita Jadeja,0.3019607843137255,448986039,1,https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dividends.jpg,eng-9418845

However, we are still exploring green, and Europe is going blue. A new country has joined, but with a new colour that we had not even considered would come into existence.

Pink hydrogen is a new form of clean energy that is gaining attention globally. It is produced in a very similar process to green hydrogen - using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called electrolysis.

The key difference with pink hydrogen is that the electricity used in the electrolysis process comes from nuclear power rather than renewable sources like solar and wind. This gives pink hydrogen some potential advantages over green hydrogen:

Pink hydrogen is still in early stages of development and adoption. But as countries look to scale up hydrogen production, pink hydrogen produced from nuclear power offers an intriguing emissions-free solution. It provides the reliability that hydrogen applications will require, while still meeting sustainability goals.

Pink hydrogen is the hydrogen that is produced through its subtraction from water and gas it has a number of benefits compared to the other hydrogen production methods. This one is so considerate to collect very low carbon hydrogen.

This nuclear-powered electrolyser will not be contributing to greenhouse gas emission pure hydrogen is the by-products in electrolysis process. Consequently, hydrogen is consistently created with no carbon emission during the process of its production.

Unconventional shades of hydrogen such as blue, turquoise, and grey, which are at least mostly based on natural gas, have a high carbon footprint. Pink hydrogen, on the other hand, is a low-carbon alternative.

Moreover, a brighter hydrogen use additionally provides the trustworthy, the consistent nuclear energy baseload. On the contrary with the intermittent free energy from solar and wind, constant power from nuclear power plants generates day and night.

Pacific has faced numerous issues in the production of hydrogen. The first thing to mention is an extremely demanding initial capital cost which nuclear power facilities use. Just one single nuclear power plant can be expensive to construct; up to $6 billion or more is the cost.

These increments in expenses make investment in the nuclear technology less appealing, and thus, renewal energies with the costs falling continuously will always remain the better option.

First, nuclear power plant correlated with the danger of radioactive wastes as the produced materials need to be disposed correctly. The issue about shipment and the storing of this hazardous waste is a key one that has to be given weight seriously on an all-round basis for thousands of years.

Moreover, contrary to the safety improvements in new reactor designs, serious environmental disasters both direct and indirect can unfortunately arise as the result of nuclear accidents.

The disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima have set out an alarming sign for nuclear power and has, therefore, triggered the lack of confidence in society regarding this form of energy.

Once again, it has been demonstrated that, when it comes to embracing sustainable development, it does not matter to invent new colors for a fuel that will accelerate the ecological transition. Pink hydrogen is a historic milestone, both in its discovery and in the initial proposals for its use, which remain to be seen.",ecoticias.com,news,ECOticias.com,,0.2705882352941176,448986003,1,https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/12867-1.jpg,eng-9420914

The bank has reaped the fruit of this strategy through accelerated growth across its financial indicators and market shares, the thing which reflects the robustness of the bank's financial position, the sustainability of its profits, and reinforces the bank's position as one of the major financial institutions regionally, and the third largest bank in terms of financing portfolio and total assets in the Kuwaiti market.""

This statement came during the general assembly meeting of Boubyan Bank for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, with an attendance exceeding 82 percent. He emphasized: ""With the conclusion of 2023, Boubyan Bank managed to have a record growth rate of 39 percent, while registering KD 80.4 million in net profits with an earnings per share of 18.8 fils, and the bank continued its precautionary approach by allocating KD 31.7 million in provisions. All this was the fruit of the bank's successful strategy 'towards perfection'.""

Al-Shaya pointed out that all of the bank's key indicators witnessed a remarkable growth in 2023, where the total combined assets of Boubyan Bank Group increased to KD 8.4 billion at a growth rate of 7 percent. Moreover, the total of customers' deposits grew by 9 percent to reach KD 6.5 billion, while the financing portfolio grew by 7 percent to reach KD 6.3 billion, and operating income grew by 8 percent to reach KD 218 million.

""What makes the results of Boubyan more significant are the core business and profitability practices of the Group, which were significantly reinforced by the bank in 2023 compared with the last financial year, while improving the NPL ratio, making it one of the lowest locally."", he elaborated.

Al-Shaya went on to add: ""Boubyan's strategy was successfully concluded with continued growth in terms of total assets and deposits, maintaining its position as the bank with the third largest financing portfolio and total assets in the Kuwaiti market, while continuing to achieve double digit profitability growth rates.""

Al-Shaya sincerely thanked the shareholders, investors, and all Boubyan's customers for their confidence and loyalty to the bank, and reiterated the Board's full and ongoing support to the efforts of the bank's highly-professional executive management, which wisely steers the bank towards achieving the best results, while thanking all the bank's employees for their dedication throughout the past year.

Furthermore, the Ordinary General Assembly approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors to distribute dividends to shareholders at the end of the financial year or semi-annually, and authorized the Board to execute the decision of the General Assembly as per the percentages decided by the board.

A year of leadership and solid performance

On his part, Boubyan Bank's Vice-Chairman & Group Chief Executive Officer, Adel Abdul Wahab Al-Majed, stated: ""Thanks to Almighty Allah, the past year witnessed the achievement of goals, milestones, and expansions, regionally and internationally, thanks to the solid pillars upon which the Group's vision and strategy are based. Hence, the bank managed to make its mark in the Islamic banking industry and to make a franchise that stands out from the competition, be they Islamic or conventional banks.""

""During Boubyan's journey, the bank managed - through well-studied steps - to become a leading franchise despite the fierce competition among the banking sector's institutions, thus following a tailored path that reinforces customer satisfaction levels, leading to receiving a 96 percent customer-satisfaction score among all Islamic and conventional local banks.

The bank's market share and its ongoing growth reflect the high levels in customer service and digital excellence, which are the fruit of the bank's clear strategy, professional executive team, and continued investment in our human resources with special focus on our national cadres"", he added. He elaborated: ""Our sustainable growth was the result of a well-studied approach towards investing in various business sectors, thus leading to significant growth in our consumer banking and corporate banking businesses, thanks to our focus on creativity and innovation, despite the fierce competition in the banking sector.""

Plans and goals

Al-Majed reiterated: ""The bank will follow its unique strategic approach to maintain solid profitability and ongoing growth, based on its sound management and status, which qualifies it to benefit from its strong potentials and solid financial position to help customers benefit from growth opportunities in our favorite markets.""

""As a part of Boubyan's vision and in line with the new brand identity refreshed in 2023, entitled 'Imagine the possibilities', we reiterate our commitment to supporting the state's development plans through financing projects, for corporates or retail customers, taking into consideration green financing. We are also targeting further regional and international expansion, as well as keeping up with the latest developments in the field of digital banking solutions and Islamic investments to better serve customers and the society"", he pointed out.

Governance

Al-Majed stated: ""Governance is one of the pillars of the credit decision and giving an advantage to customers who have sound governance practices in place. Accordingly, Boubyan has been keen on applying the instructions and guidelines of CBK in that regard. This has been taken into consideration as well upon designing the banking applications which include a number of authorities for various management levels at companies, in addition to providing the possibility of internal monitoring by the company over the performed transactions in order to ensure the uninterrupted provision of secure and cutting-edge banking services.""

""The concept of digital transformation in banking institutions has become associated to a great extent with the name of Boubyan, as the phrase 'for the first time in Kuwait' has been mostly synonymous with Boubyan Bank's innovative services and solutions in Islamic digital banking"", Al-Majed added.

He went on to highlight: ""Boubyan Bank's digital transformation strategy gained a significant momentum, being a real example for succeeding in being highly competitive regionally in digital services, and in changing the lives of our customers through our services and products. Our digital services' journey is very exceptional. It has seen us excel and climb to the top of the pyramid amid tough competition in the market for digital banking services which is growing rapidly.""

Al-Majed went on to add: ""Boubyan offers a group of innovative services, products, and digital solutions through its retail and corporate Apps. Such offerings add value to customers and show the bank's keenness to maintain its leadership in innovation to ensure supporting its customers, enriching their banking experience, and making things easier, especially amid the competition across various business sectors. This reflects the bank's ongoing approach to develop the digital infrastructure and to offer the best services in the field of digital payments.""

In 2023, Boubyan inaugurated a number of new branches, bringing the number to 47 branches across Kuwait, which were fully upgraded and modernized as per the latest international systems and standards. The branches were well-manned with competent banking professionals along with all resources that guarantee customers enjoy a swift, convenient, smooth, and unique banking experience that keeps pace with the developments of banking services.

Awards and international ratings

Al-Majed added: ""In 2023, Boubyan received more than 20 awards, recognitions, and international ratings from renowned global institutions across various domains and business sectors such as digital transformation, corporate banking, customer service, and customer satisfaction, which reinforced our banking leadership and emphasized the strength of the strategy the bank has been adopting since many years locally, regionally, and internationally.""

Furthermore, our ratings from Moody's, S&P, and Fitch remain stable at A2, A, and A respectively. As for the ex-government support (or xgs) rating assigned by Fitch, the introduction of such new criteria communicates Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of Boubyan excluding assumptions of extraordinary government support. Boubyan was assigned the second highest rating in Kuwait as per such criteria.

Nomo Bank: International expansion

In 2023, Nomo Bank, the digital bank of the Bank of London and the Middle East ""BLME"", a subsidiary of Boubyan Bank Group, launched unique products and services that put it on par with top financial institutions, whereby it aspires to become the Islamic bank of choice for GCC customers in the United Kingdom.

Moreover, Nomo continues to make its mark in the Islamic digital banking sector through the recent launch of many products such as the multicurrency account, which allows customers to perform their banking transactions in six different currencies, enabling them to make payments in local currencies in more than 25 countries spanned across Europe and the Middle East within seconds using Nomo App, in addition to immediately benefiting from remittance and fund-transfer services, coupled with the possibility of automatically linking the account with Nomo Card and Apple Pay.

Nomo managed to position itself as one of the best Sharia-compliant property finance options in the United Kingdom, as it offers a group of integrated real estate, finance, and advisory services related to ownership of real estate properties in the UK market to its customers in Kuwait and the region, through partnerships with major real estate companies such as Ayan Real Estate, Blueprint, and Great Portland. Additionally, Nomo inked significant agreements such as the partnership with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank ""ADCB"" and Al-Hilal Digital Bank to give citizens and residents of the UAE an opportunity to benefit from the innovative services and solutions by Nomo Bank through ADCB - Nomo and Al-Hilal Nomo Apps.

Corporate banking

Al-Majed further reiterated: ""In 2023, the Corporate Banking Group managed to make a significant milestone by diversifying and improving a number of products and services, and it is expected to begin to reap the reward of that as of 2024.

This targeted all companies across various sectors in Kuwait, in an attempt to offer innovative and edge-cutting banking services, being the traditional concept limited to financing transactions, thus not only making it as a one-stop shop for all corporate banking needs, but also extending to provide services to customers and corporate vendors. Accordingly, this made the bank more inclined towards focusing on innovation in products and services, in addition to upgrading the bank's processes.""

CSR and human resources

Boubyan succeeded to stand out as an excellent role model in CSR and in the support of sustainability through many events and initiatives that made a clear mark and emphasized the bank's social excellence, as well as its ongoing plans, which were crowned with the ""World's Best Islamic Bank for CSR"" by Global Finance in recognition of the bank's prominent CSR role in supporting various segments of the society, which confirms that the bank is on the right track to reinforce sustainable development inside and outside Kuwait. During the past year, the bank's human resources proved themselves to be one of the key pillars of its continued success, as they embrace and adopt Boubyan's future vision, the thing which comes in line with the principle of diverse job roles at the workplace, which greatly contributes to the introduction of innovative and creative ideas and deliverables, which significantly increase the bank's productivity and profitability.

Thanks & appreciations

Al-Shaya concluded his word during the general assembly meeting: ""For myself and on behalf all the team of Boubyan Bank, I would like to express deepest thanks and appreciation to His Highness the Amir Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, may Allah protect him, and HH Sheikh Dr Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, the Prime Minister, for all their efforts towards the development and growth of our dear country, and to guarantee the stability and security of everyone who considers this blessed land home.""

He added: ""I would also like to express the deepest thanks to all the executives of the Central Bank of Kuwait, headed by Governor Basel Al-Haroon, who spared no effort to take the actions deemed appropriate to develop and safeguard the Kuwaiti banking system. I would also like to express deepest thanks to all the bank's esteemed shareholders and customers who have always been the key factor behind our success by supporting us in overcoming our challenges.

Moreover, I would like to thank all members of the Sharia Supervisory Board at the bank for their great efforts, and I would like to thank members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management, as well as all the bank's employees for their cooperation, commitment, and keenness on supporting the bank for the benefit of the bank and its shareholders.""

Speaking at the Love in the Market charity ball under the Elevate Ghana Forex Project, on the theme; 'Digital Finance, A Boom or Doom to the African Economy', she emphasized the critical role of digitalization in driving economic growth but underscored the lack of foundational support, particularly in terms of data infrastructure.

""Digital finance in general is a boom for every economy in Africa and other continents. We however, don't have the fundamentals, we do not have enough infrastructure in terms of our data.

You can see what happened with the internet a week ago, banks, forex traders and lots of businesses that depend on the internet to operate were halted. If we are able to sustain a robust infrastructure for digitalization, we will have more booms than dooms but now, I think we are in the doom, because we do not have the fundamentals to sustain what we are looking for,"" she asserted.

""We have been advocating for the past four, five years and we hear it's coming on next year, we are doing this, we are doing that I will use this opportunity again to advocate for the need of financial structures. If we have companies coming in to create job opportunities for forex traders, we wouldn't even have to trade in dollars but in the cedis.

Every forex trader in Ghana trades in dollars, we now have to take a lot of cedis, change to dollars to trade and these come with charges that go to other foreign companies outside the country but if you have regulation, you will not need to do that and the more forex traders are trained toy trade in cedis the more the cedis can compete with other currencies, for now, cedis is not trade-able on the market at all,"" she added.

Lamenting the the impact and vulnerabilities exposed by such disruptions, Annor Sika pointed that ""every major forex trader lost, from Ghana, Nigeria especially South Africa, because they are regulated so a lot of people trade there. It is going into millions, not in Ghana but South Africa because we do not have a lot of forex traders in Ghana. It wasn't good at all. If it had lasted, I think a lot of people would have gone bankrupt, speaking specifically for forex traders"".

Addressing concerns about money laundering and fraudulent activities in the forex market, Annor stressed the importance of regulation and licensing.

""If there's a way the government is able to regulate the forex market through some research development to get something going there.

""It easier for people to launder money with forex because it's online, first of all it is not licensed and registered in the country especially with crypto currencies, it is not even allowed in the country if I'm supposed to do 10,000, someone may say I can't transfer more than 10,000 through the banking system, I'll buy myself a Bitcoin and the government will not get any charges and will not get any idea about it, back to the regulation and licensing,"" highlighting the necessity for government intervention to protect citizens and maintain market integrity,"" the financial analyst explained.

According to reports, when Arvind Kejriwal was asked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials about the said phone, the Delhi Chief Minister said he was not aware where the phone is at present.

Kejriwal was questioned by probing officials on Sunday for almost four hours.

The probing agency has recorded the statement of one Sameer Mahendru in jail today. On Tuesday, Kejriwal may be questioned infront of C Arvind, who was the secretary of Manish Sisodia.

A while ago, Kejriwal's wife Sunita went to ED office to meet the Delhi Chief Minister.

Earlier today, Kejriwal issued his first direction from ED custody on running the city government, instructing Water Minister Atishi to solve water- and sewer-related problems in some areas of the city.

Addressing a press conference, Atishi said the directions, received late on Saturday, brought tears to her eyes with Kejriwal showing concern for the people of Delhi despite his own plight.

The chief minister also directed for deploying enough water tankers in areas where there is scarcity to strengthen supply ahead of the approaching summer months, Atishi said. The minister said Kejriwal directed to issue instructions to the chief secretary and other officers in this regard.

He also suggested seeking the help of Lt Governor VK Saxena, if needed, and expects that he will extend all assistance, she said.

In another development, the I.N.D.I.A bloc on Sunday announced that they will hold a mega rally against Kejriwal's arrest on March 31.

But those who mentored some of the 810 high school students who submitted works to the 13th annual juried show said creating these submissions was just as important as winning People's Choice or any of the other awards presented to the young artists.

""This program has been transformative in my classroom,"" said Lynbrook High School art teacher Matthew Reynolds, who has seven students with artwork in the show. ""It encourages my students to go big. Whether they get in the show or not, they end up having an amazing experience.""

Leland High School senior Jennie Yang wrote in her artist statement that her multimedia work ""Transformation"" was inspired by ""significant changes in my life as I navigated through high school, both internally and externally.""

""I went to high school thinking I would seclude myself due to unpleasant experiences in middle school, but deep down, I wanted to reach out and meet new people,"" Yang wrote. ""I chose (to paint) a cocoon to represent these internal changes.""

NUMU Executive Director Kimberly Snyder said 250 students submitted works to the first ArtNow show in 2012. She attributed the much higher number of submissions this year in part to the work of NUMU's teen council, whose members helped develop the show's theme ""In Transition.""

Mexico will put its security interests first and won't fight drug cartels just because the US wants it to, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday. While admitting that tens of thousands of people are dying due to drug overdoses in the neighboring country, Obrador insisted that Mexicans will not ""act as policemen for any foreign government.""

He noted that it would be a humanitarian effort, highlighting the priority of the security of the homeland. ""Mexico First. Our home comes first,"" the president said.

Last year, Lopez Obrador pointed out that he considers the overdose crisis to be an internal US problem. ""We deeply lament what's happening in the United States - but why don't they fight the problem ... and more importantly, why don't they take care of their youth?"", he asked rhetorically.

US law enforcement officials, for their part, have on numerous occasions blamed Mexican officials for their apparent refusal to cooperate on efforts to target fentanyl labs inside Mexico.

Ethereum Will Cross the $5,500 Mark by December 2024, Say Experts

Despite reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $4,891.70 in November 2021, Ethereum experienced a downturn in the next years. However, in March, the price of ETH reached $4,092.28, signaling a resurgence in its value. However, the price of ETH retraced amid market volatility.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong has emerged as a key player in the global cryptocurrency landscape, particularly in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While Bitcoin ETFs face delays in their launch, Hong Kong is poised to introduce Ethereum ETFs, racing to establish itself as a frontrunner in the global crypto market.

This strategic move aims to bridge the potential gap between Asian and American investorsand strengthen Hong Kong's position in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. So, is ETH the best crypto to buy now?

Market experts anticipate significant growth opportunities for Ethereum, fueled by ongoing upgrades and the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by mid-2024. With these factors in mind, experts predict that ETH could surpass the $5,500 mark and reach $5,711 by the end of 2024.

In bearish market circumstances, ETH is expected to maintain a price level below $4,866 in 2024, reflecting a cautious stance amidst potential market fluctuations.

Market Analysts Anticipate BCH Reaching a Price of $639 in 2024

At the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin Cash witnessed a remarkable surge, propelled by the anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETF approval, soaring to as high as $296.81.

However, the momentum proved challenging to sustain, leading to a dip in BCH's price by the end of January. Nevertheless, BCH recovered by March, reaching $525.25, which was followed by a retracement to a price below $400.

The layoffs for one of America's biggest automakers become effective on March 31 and are white-collar jobs largely at the company's headquarters and a chemical center in Auburn Hills, Michigan, covering engineering, technology and software roles, Stellantis told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Stellantis has so far waited to bring its electric offerings to market, avoiding heavy sales losses accrued by competitors like Ford, which lost $4.7 billion on EVs in 2023.

""As the auto industry continues to face unprecedented uncertainties and heightened competitive pressures around the world, Stellantis continues to make the appropriate structural decisions across the enterprise to improve efficiency and optimize our cost structure,"" Stellantis told the DCNF. ""While we understand this is difficult news, these actions will better align resources while preserving the critical skills needed to protect our competitive advantage as we remain laser focused on implementing our EV product offensive and our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.""

Stellantis has previously said that it plans to have 100% of sales in Europe be electric and 50% of sales in the U.S. be electric by 2030. The layoffs represent just 2% of the company's engineering, technology and software roles, Stellantis told the DCNF.

Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis, has previously said that EVs currently cost around 40% more to make than traditional vehicles and that the company is looking for ways to bring costs down, according to The Associated Press. The automaker plans to launch 18 new EV models this year but notes that the prices are not where Stellantis would like them to be.

Stellantis announced in December that it could be laying off thousands of employees from plants in Detroit and Ohio as it adjusts production to comply with environmental regulations in California. The mandated standards in California require cars in the state to have fewer emissions, coercing automakers into hastening a transition to EVs.

The Biden administration is also pushing for an expedited EV transition, imposing harsh limits over the next decade on tailpipe emissions. On Wednesday, regulators rolled back the timeline slightly for the next few years on emission restrictions, giving automakers more time to create their EV line-up, but did not change their final goal of requiring around 67% of all light-duty vehicles sold after 2023 to be EVs or hybrids.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Investors are reassessing their strategies after a pause in the stellar run of dollar-funded trades amid signs the Federal Reserve may not ease as aggressively as previously anticipated. Carry traders borrow in low-yielding countries to invest in higher-yielding assets, often in emerging markets. An ideal funding currency is characterized by low volatility and limited scope to strengthen.

While the yen remains the world's lowest-yielding currency despite the Bank of Japan's exit from negative rates, heightened expectations for its appreciation and volatility may deter borrowers. The yuan compares more favorably to the Taiwan dollar on those metrics and is more attractive than the greenback on both implied yield and volatility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China's managed currency has been kept in a tight range by Beijing this year, with little scope for appreciation given the sluggish economic conditions. A slide below a key support level on Friday suggested officials are comfortable with a further depreciation in the currency.

The yuan ""has become more of an option for funding with the People's Bank of China in easing mode as the economy struggles to find its footing,"" said Brendan McKenna, an emerging market economist and currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC.

Low volatility and a stable trading range ""makes a strong case"" for its suitability for carry trades, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a note on March 11.

Investors are looking for alternatives to dollar-based strategies amid signs the Fed might not ease as aggressively as some anticipated. Bloomberg's gauge of eight emerging market carry trades funded by the greenback lost 0.6% so far this quarter, after a 4.5% gain in the final three months of 2023.

Regarding the yuan, ""I wouldn't necessarily say bet on a huge devaluation, but if you want to look to carry trades I think that's a good one, absolutely,"" Olga Yangol, chief strategist, Americas, at Credit Agricole SA said prior to the raft of central bank action this week. Yangol said she's long on the Turkish lira and also likes some Asian currencies, but considers the Mexican peso expensive.

The yuan's one-month implied volatility hit its lowest since 2017 earlier this month before rising on Friday. The offshore yuan's interbank interest rates in Hong Kong, a benchmark gauge of offshore yuan's borrowing costs in Hong Kong, has fallen to around 3%, from a peak of nearly 4.5% in September.

An unexpected interest-rate increase in Taiwan this week, which pushed up the policy benchmark to its highest since 2008, may hurt the Taiwan dollar's carry appeal. Still, some analysts believe the hike, aimed at countering inflation, will be the last for this cycle.

Japan's still-low interest rates mean the yen is still considered attractive by some. When the BOJ raised rates for this first time in 17 years this week, Governor Kazuo Ueda made it clear policy would remain accommodative.

Yen overnight indexed swaps are pricing a rise in the BOJ's policy benchmark to around 0.3% in December.

""Carry trades are probably going to remain attractive with the yen as a funder,"" said Nicholas Chia, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. ""This will be conditional on the BOJ keeping rates lower for longer, which I think will be the case.""

In the euro area, the European Central Bank's most important decision in this respect normally relates to the key interest rates. Any change it makes to these rates affects in turn the interest rates commercial banks charge their customers for borrowing money. In other words, the decision influences consumer spending and business investment. In the case of the ECB, the objective of monetary policy is to keep prices stable, i.e. to keep inflation at 2% over the medium term. This in turn helps it support general EU economic policies aiming at full employment and economic growth.

Once again the two local organisations that represent some of Cornwall's best-loved micro businesses and artisan enterprises are teaming up to host the first in a series of monthly markets called the BIG Truro Market, showcasing Cornwall's best and brightest indie traders.

The same people who brought you the Christmas market complete with the Alpine huts, are now getting ready to launch a Big Truro Market - Easter special. Taking place on Lemon Quay on Easter Saturday. Daffodils and hot cross buns will be among the goodies on show to entice shoppers into the city.

Sarah Curley from Cornwall Shop Small said: ""We're using our collective power to put on an unmissable showcase of Cornish creativity and ingenuity, where passion and positivity comes free with every purchase! You'd be hard pushed to find a brighter, more eclectic, and uplifting shopping experience anywhere.""

The event is brought to the city with the support of Truro BID and Visit Truro, and promises 60 stalls bursting to the rafters with seasonal goodies and goodness, as well as music, entertainment, street food, children's activities, and an Easter Egg Hunt, amounting to an unmissable day of fun in the heart of the city.

The stallholders will be a mix of local artists and contemporary crafters from the worlds of jewellery, fashion, homewares, and vintage style, alongside farm-fresh food produce, sustainable seafood, and some of Cornwall's best-loved food and drink brands.

Each BIG Truro Market will also feature activities for all the family to get stuck into. Truro Nourish Hub will be hosting seasonal crafting activities for kids, and giving away free hot cross bun recipe cards so the fun can continue at home.

There will also be an Easter Egg Hunt beginning at 10am; to take part, people will need to find one of the wooden eggs hidden in the vicinity of the market and exchange it for a surprise Easter treat (one per person).

Stewart Girvan, market coordinator at Truro Farmers Market said: ""The aim is for these monthly BIG Truro Markets to be immersive, in that they will engage all the senses and invite people to get involved with workshops and competitions for example. The Easter Special will be the perfect way to kick things off, with a rejuvenating, celebratory vibe to usher in springtime.""",cornwalllive.com,news,Cornwall Live,Olivier Vergnault,0.4980392156862745,448985080,1,https://i2-prod.cornwalllive.com/incoming/article9175884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_COLLAB-MARKET-WIDE-SHOT-MR.jpg,

Rubicon was joined by climate investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions and Silversmith Capital Partners.

This funding round will accelerate Ascend's product innovation and expand its suite of analytics solutions, enhancing the company's ability to serve energy market stakeholders navigating an increasingly complex power grid. Dr. Gary Dorris, who co-founded the company in 2002, will continue leading the company as CEO while also assuming the role of chairman.

Ascend's products enable utilities, renewable developers, independent power producers, financial institutions, and other energy market stakeholders to develop, finance, and optimize energy assets in an increasingly complex energy market landscape. This year, utilities in the US have nearly doubled the projections for power generation by 2028 to accommodate growing demand - which was sparked by an uptick in manufacturing and an explosion of new data centers and other factors.

As more electricity is generated from renewable sources susceptible to weather-related interruptions, utility providers that can model volatility into their approach have a critical advantage. Ascend's ability to provide energy analytics in a commercial context enables its customers to translate new and clean power sources into actionable insights and economic opportunities.

The company's product suite includes BatterySIMM (recognized as the de facto standard for energy storage modeling and development), PowerSIMM (a resource selection and portfolio management solution), and SmartBidder (an energy storage bidding optimization platform). And the company's existing customer base includes some of the largest utilities and renewables developers in North America and Europe.

KEY QUOTES:

""For multiple decades, Ascend's mission has been to help its customers realize their energy transition objectives. Having now reached an inflection point in the transition, this partnership allows Ascend to grow at the speed and scale necessary to meet the moment. We are so proud of everything our team has accomplished, and although we are veterans in the sector, it feels like we are just getting started.""

- Dr. Gary Dorris, CEO and co-founder of Ascend

""From day one working with Gary and team, their unmatched expertise and thought leadership in an incredibly dynamic energy market were unmistakable. The energy market turns to Ascend for its most complex problems, given its highly differentiated suite of software and services. We couldn't be more excited to partner with Ascend to continue innovating and advancing its products to meet customers' evolving needs.""

- Alison Beyer, Principal at Rubicon Technology Partners

""Even before meeting Gary and his team, we understood that Ascend was unique, having established itself as the go-to provider for utility-scale storage software, intelligence, and valuation solutions. Ascend's superior information and analytics capabilities are distinctly suited to support power market participants in navigating complex grid dynamics driven by escalating load growth, distributed generation, and higher penetration of renewables.""

- Saloni Multani, Co-Head of Innovation + Expansion at Galvanize Climate Solutions

""We back founders who know their markets so well that they find the gaps and seams to build big, important businesses where others didn't see the possibility. We believe Gary is just that type of visionary founder and we are thrilled to be joining our friends at Rubicon and Galvanize in supporting him during the next phase of Ascend's journey.""",pulse2.com,news,Pulse 2.0,Amit Chowdhry,0.3411764705882352,448985063,1,https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2024/03/Ascend-Analytics-Logo.jpeg,

Higher gas prices are driven by deliberate policy choices.,"Gas prices in California are the highest in the nation, and the state recently announced its policies are about to drive them even higher.

A recent Los Angeles Times editorial completely misrepresented the root causes and attempted to cast blame in the wrong place. This is the same tactic the governor and Legislature have been using to try to displace the blame, but the facts speak for themselves. For example, it is a FACT that many factors impact California's gas prices, but policy choices made by the governor, Legislature, and state regulators have made California's gas and diesel prices the highest in the nation.

As of March 11, 2024, state and local governments collected $1.24/gallon in taxes and fees -- 27 percent of the total cost of a gallon of gas goes to state and local agencies and another 18 cents above this goes to federal taxes. These aren't industry talking points; these are FACTS provided by the California Energy Commission tracked and monitored over the past 20-plus years. The California government collects a 58-cent state excise tax, 12 cent per gallon low carbon fuel standard cost, 54 cents for cap and trade and other environmental fees, 10 cents for state and local sales tax, and a 2-cent state underground storage fee.

How do the governor and editorial writers at the Times justify this? Especially because gasoline taxes are one of the most regressive taxes in the state and are directly responsible for our high cost of living and high inflation rate. To offset this fact, the governor and Legislature argue that the money goes to pay for environmental programs.

While that may have been the Legislature and regulators' original intent, these environmental fees are unrestricted profits to the state and can be used for whatever purpose the governor and Legislature wish, regardless of their connection to the environment. This year, the governor plans to take the profit he's made off of all California drivers' gasoline and diesel purchases to backfill the state's general fund budget.

We all agree we must address climate change, but we must balance ambition with reality, especially cost. According to a recent report for the Center for Jobs and the Economy California's aggressive climate laws and regulations have done no better and, in some years, worse than the rest of the nation, but they are increasing the price of electricity, fuels and natural gas. Other states have produced actual emissions reductions by pursuing alternative and generally less costly approaches.

Meanwhile, regulators and the governor are doubling down on their expensive policies that are driving up the cost of living. According to the Energy Commission, currently, our unique gas adds 15 cents to every gallon sold in California. In just a few months, CARB expects that cost could increase by another 47 cents per gallon. Eventually, this program could increase by a total of $1.83/gallon -- and both are CARB estimates in constant 2021 dollars that do not account for inflation-on top of the other environmental fees and taxes that are already the highest in the nation.

At a time when Californians are paying more for electricity, housing, food, and other necessities they cannot afford a 50-cent increase per gallon, let alone nearly two dollars more.

The bottom line is that California's policy choices are driving the high cost at the pump, and they're continuing to do so. It might be easier to play the blame game, but the facts are the facts -- the state of California makes a lot more money off a gallon of gas than oil companies do.

These facts aren't refuted by regulators (in fact, they're the ones who publish them), or even politicians.

But deflecting blame won't lower costs, won't bring down inflation, won't make it easier for working families to thrive in California. We need realistic policy solutions, not scapegoats, and trying to deflect blame won't lead to meaningful solutions anytime soon.",dailybreeze.com,news,Daily Breeze,,-0.05098039215686279,448985027,1,https://www.dailybreeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OCR-Z-INFLATION-1213.jpg?w=640,

The services had been disrupted since last November after the company that prints the documents stopped service following a delay in payments by the MVD. The State government launched PVC PET-G smart card driving licenses last year, replacing laminated cards.

However, the printing of the cards has been delayed since last November after the private firm engaged in the printing of the documents stopped the service in the wake of mounting arrears. The State had then owed a whopping ₹8.66 crore to ITI Bengaluru. The MVD was also liable to pay a service charge of ₹6.58 crore to the C-DIT since January 2023 for providing facility management services, apart from the service charge arrears to the tune of around ₹6 crore to the postal department in connection with the despatching of documents by post

Later, the Cabinet meeting held in the last week of February released ₹15 crore to clear the pending arrears the department owes to ITI Bengaluru and the C-DIT. In a media briefing, Transport Minister K.B. Ganesh Kumar said all the pending arrears, including the payment to the Postal department, have been cleared and the printing and distribution of the documents have resumed. The issue between the MVD and the Postal department is also solved. In case, the Postal department raises any further issues, the courier service of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will be roped in for the distribution of these documents, said the Minister.

It is estimated that as many as 10 lakhs documents were to be printed since November. The services were hit following the poor financial situation of the State government. The services were also disrupted despite the MVD collecting user fees from the public for delivering various services.

That means it is the monopoly supplier of the monetary base. By virtue of this monopoly, it can set the conditions at which banks borrow from the central bank. Therefore it can also influence the conditions at which banks trade with each other in the money market.

In the short run, a change in money market interest rates induced by the central bank sets in motion a number of mechanisms and actions by economic agents. Ultimately the change will influence developments in economic variables such as output or prices. This process - also known as the monetary policy transmission mechanism - is highly complex. While its broad features are understood, there is no consensus on its detailed functioning.

It is widely agreed that in the long run - after all adjustments in the economy have worked through - a change in the quantity of money in the economy will be reflected in a change in the general level of prices. But it will not induce permanent changes in real variables such as real output or unemployment.

This general principle, referred to as ""the long-run neutrality of money"", underlies all standard macroeconomic thinking. Real income or the level of employment are, in the long term, essentially determined by real factors, such as technology, population growth or the preferences of economic agents.

In the long run a central bank can only contribute to raising the growth potential of the economy by maintaining an environment of stable prices. It cannot enhance economic growth by expanding the money supply or keeping short-term interest rates at a level inconsistent with price stability. It can only influence the general level of prices.

Ultimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Prolonged periods of high inflation are typically associated with high monetary growth. While other factors (such as variations in aggregate demand, technological changes or commodity price shocks) can influence price developments over shorter horizons, over time their effects can be offset by a change in monetary policy.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,0.04313725490196085,448984963,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?06035f12747458d70b9eefbe7a314429,

Government has all but collapsed. Feuding criminal gangs vie for control. The value of output, already low, is falling and health and nutrition, already bad, are worsening.

With the eyes of the world focused on acute geopolitical dangers in Ukraine and the Middle East, there has been passing attention paid to an island country with a population of 11 million, who are overwhelmingly Black. Understandable but tragic.

Haiti's travails eventually may affect our nation slightly, but with the closest sea distance to Florida six times greater than that from Cuba, there is little chance of a small-craft armada like the 1980 Mariel boatlift that brought 125,000 Cubans to our country. The Biden administration, already tarred as having failed on immigration, studiously avoids the issue.

But going beyond the immediate foreign policy challenge, it might be good to start paying attention. Why? Because Haiti's situation forces us to think about age-old economic questions to which we still have no clear answers: Why are some nations almost inherently more productive and prosperous than others? Why do some have more successful governments? Why do some have societies that are more cohesive and just than others?

Why, for example, is Uruguay both more prosperous, more stable politically and with better social indicators of health, nutrition and education than its otherwise similar neighbor Argentina just across an estuary? Why did 19th century Japan take off economically when no other Asian country did? Why did the republics of the Netherlands and the city-state of Geneva have such dynamic economies and intellectual ferment in the 1700s, while France, Spain and other monarchies stagnated?

And at a different level, why do Oregon and Minnesota, for example, consistently best Alabama and Mississippi in every economic and social indicator?

Sometimes we can get ""new ideas from dead economists,"" in a phrase Todd Buchholz used as a title for his excellent introduction to economic thought.

Eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher Adam Smith knew a little about Haiti, but his ideas sift through factors that explain its situation -- vis-à-vis even its more prosperous neighbor, the Dominican Republic. A man-made line geographically divides the island. But a world divides their economies.

One may not always agree with Smith's conclusions, but his questions and insights remain invaluable to both curious and influential minds.

In his best-known 1776 book, ""An Inquiry into the Nature and the Causes of the Wealth of Nations,"" Smith argued that prevailing beliefs in his day in having government take large roles in economic activity were not just wrong, but strongly counter-productive. And he railed against remaining elements of the medieval guild system that sharply limited who could do what in professions and skilled trades.

However, perhaps more importantly but less well known, Smith had written an earlier relevant book. In ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments,"" Smith examined how and why people, motivated in great part by self-interest, still develop empathy, a concern for others, a willingness to cooperate with others, and how this trait contributes to effective and just societies.

So one might ask what sorts of policies Haiti has followed? What sort of social ethos has developed there? And how would Smith explain this?

Generally through history, regardless of laws that remain nominally in effect, Haiti has been a kleptocracy, a political and economic system based on theft by controlling individuals or groups.

While Christopher Columbus never actually got to any of our 50 states, he landed on Hispaniola on his very first voyage. Within a few decades, virtually all of the native population died of violence, disease and brutal slavery.

Spain retained a colonial government on most of the island, with the French eventually gaining the western section, what is now Haiti. Both were repopulated by slaves violently brought from Africa by English merchants, who financed the slave ships that handled the largest part of the trade. This brought enormous wealth to Britain during Smith's life, something he notes, but does not really examine.

Slave labor for sugar cane production in Haiti was probably the most brutal and deadly in any slave nation. There were numerous slave revolts in the 1700s, all put down with extreme cruelty and savagery. One in the 1790s eventually led to the nation's independence in 1804.

However, France still had clout to force the Haitians pay reparations to France for property taken -- including themselves as former chattel. The initial payment was five times the country's annual budget, so interest accrued. In the 1920s, what is now Citibank took over the Haitian promissory note from France and collected payments until 1947.

Adding yet another factor of U.S. involvement, in addition to our commercial interests always having influence in Haiti's economy and government, we sent Marines to occupy the whole country in 1914. They stayed until 1931. So Haiti was a de facto U.S. colony for nearly two decades. Moreover, after leaving, we manipulated who had power and oversaw the ascension of Francois Duvalier, who ran a brutal dictatorship for 31 years.

So U.S. hands are covered with Haitian blood. We were part of the process by which that country became dominated by a French-speaking economic and political elite that extracted wealth at the expense of the Creole-speaking masses.

De facto economic institutions and policies in Haiti have left little to market forces. Outright corruption and a bureaucratic system of licenses and permits dominate resource allocation -- similar to the merchant guild system that Smith denounced. The judicial system is corrupt. Government fails to deliver even basic services.

All this tragic history means that Smith's ""moral sentiments"" never had an opportunity to prosper in Haiti as they had in 1700s Amsterdam and Geneva. Nor have the ""mediating structures"" that sociologist Peter Berger and theologian Richard Neuhaus saw as vital to society gained a footing. All of these traits, when generally adopted by a population, become ""values,"" in that they bring value to a society and an economy.

Will they ever in Haiti? The U.S. occupation a century ago gave Haiti roads, water and sewer systems along with schools and clinic buildings. But it also cemented the power of the elites and established a brutal dictatorship. U.S. peacekeepers sent in 2004 restored order and made room for some political reform, but a massive earthquake in 2010 and hurricane in 2016 were harsh blows.

So Smith gave us some reference points into the knotty issues of failing governments and economies as do many more recent scholars including not only Berger but Robert Putnam on ""social capital."" Robert Axelrod's insights on ""the evolution of cooperation"" deals with issues parallel to Smith's moral sentiments.

And what does this say about us? With rampant road rage, random shootings, customers throwing hot coffee back in the faces of food servers, obstreperous passengers in airplanes, brawling melees at amusement parks, malls and on cruise ships, one may wonder whether our own moral sentiments are dying, our mediating structures collapsing and our social capital melting away. Perhaps they are. We are more bitterly divided now than we have been for more than a century.

It is therefore important to understand how these policies interact and contribute to ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area. Indeed, in the absence of national monetary and exchange rate policies to respond to country-specific shocks, fiscal policies can be designed to cushion such shocks if they start from a sound position. Similarly, sound structural policies can help to strengthen economic resilience and thereby contribute to the smooth functioning of EMU. Other aspects of EMU governance are also relevant from a monetary policy perspective. In this regard, the ECB is particularly interested in understanding the benefits of, and the obstacles to, financial integration within EMU, including the establishment of a banking union and a capital markets union, and their implications for monetary policy implementation.

Attacks, including a shooting that left a gang leader dead, flared in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, on Thursday as political groups appeared nearer to finalising a transition council to take over from an absent government.

A police operation killed the head of the Delmas 95 gang, Ernst Julme, known as Ti Greg, a day after another gang leader was killed in an apparent resurgence of vigilante justice, police and sources confirmed.

The death of Julme, a member of gang leader Jimmy ""Barbeque"" Cherizier's ""Viv Ansanm"" alliance, marks a setback for gangs' moves to take over more of the city.

Julme had recently escaped from Haiti's largest prison in a mass jailbreak.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed reports that political groups had selected all members of a transitional council that would take over presidential powers ahead of future elections, a U.N. spokesperson said.

The council, intended to bring together Haiti's fractured political class, is tasked with appointing a replacement for Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who announced his resignation on March 11 as gang violence prevented his return to the country.

""The Secretary-General welcomes reports that Haitian stakeholders have all nominated representatives to the Transitional Presidential Council,"" deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said at a media briefing.

The transition plan was brokered in Jamaica by the intergovernmental Caribbean Community (CARICOM), alongside representatives of Haiti's government and opposition. CARICOM released a list of political groups that would be represented in the council.

The nine-member council had been expected to be finalised within a few days of Henry's resignation, but some Haitian political factions were unable to unite behind one representative.

One party rejected the plan, then backtracked, while groups left out of the plan criticised the return of politicians from previous administrations seen as corrupt.

Cherizier has threatened reprisals against politicians and their families if they take part in the proposed council.

As the council seemed to near completion, heavy gunfire was heard on Thursday near the National Palace off the Champ de Mars square in downtown Port-au-Prince, while people fled shootings in the capital's Petion-Ville suburb.

On Wednesday suspected gang members in Petion-Ville, which has been under attack over recent days, were killed and set on fire - including one leader known as Makandal - in what appeared to be a resurgence of a civilian vigilante movement known as Bwa Kale.

Local media reported another Bwa Kale killing outside the capital on Thursday, though Reuters was unable to verify this.

The state has been largely absent during the violence and police are ill-equipped against heavily armed criminal groups seeking to expand their territorial control of the capital city. Plans for an international security mission, requested by Henry in 2022, remain on hold.

Haq said the international force's swift deployment was critical for the political and security situations to improve.

He said the U.N. would support restoring Haiti's democratic institutions and called for the protection of civilians.

The U.N. and other international bodies and embassies have been evacuating staff and other foreigners by helicopter because Haiti's main airport is not secure.

Canada's government said late on Thursday that the Canadian Armed Forces were working with the Canadian Embassy in Haiti to assist in contingency planning. It did not elaborate, but its statement came in response to reports that Canadian soldiers were flown in to protect the Canadian embassy.

As regards retail payments, the ECB contributed to harmonising the way non-cash euro payments are made by actively facilitating the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).

The ECB supports the EU issuance service (EIS) for the settlement of debt securities under the Next Generation EU programme, as well as of other debt instruments issued by the European Commission on behalf of the European Union (EU) and Euratom.

The EIS allows the distribution of securities via the NBB-SSS as issuer CSD and its links with investor CSDs throughout the EU, ensuring level playing field access for investors and promoting post-trade harmonisation at the European level. The securities will be settled in central bank money in TARGET2-Securities (T2S), but CSDs not participating in T2S can also access the securities.

Higher gas prices are driven by deliberate policy choices.,"Gas prices in California are the highest in the nation, and the state recently announced its policies are about to drive them even higher.

A recent Los Angeles Times editorial completely misrepresented the root causes and attempted to cast blame in the wrong place. This is the same tactic the governor and Legislature have been using to try to displace the blame, but the facts speak for themselves. For example, it is a FACT that many factors impact California's gas prices, but policy choices made by the governor, Legislature, and state regulators have made California's gas and diesel prices the highest in the nation.

As of March 11, 2024, state and local governments collected $1.24/gallon in taxes and fees -- 27 percent of the total cost of a gallon of gas goes to state and local agencies and another 18 cents above this goes to federal taxes. These aren't industry talking points; these are FACTS provided by the California Energy Commission tracked and monitored over the past 20-plus years. The California government collects a 58-cent state excise tax, 12 cent per gallon low carbon fuel standard cost, 54 cents for cap and trade and other environmental fees, 10 cents for state and local sales tax, and a 2-cent state underground storage fee.

How do the governor and editorial writers at the Times justify this? Especially because gasoline taxes are one of the most regressive taxes in the state and are directly responsible for our high cost of living and high inflation rate. To offset this fact, the governor and Legislature argue that the money goes to pay for environmental programs.

While that may have been the Legislature and regulators' original intent, these environmental fees are unrestricted profits to the state and can be used for whatever purpose the governor and Legislature wish, regardless of their connection to the environment. This year, the governor plans to take the profit he's made off of all California drivers' gasoline and diesel purchases to backfill the state's general fund budget.

We all agree we must address climate change, but we must balance ambition with reality, especially cost. According to a recent report for the Center for Jobs and the Economy California's aggressive climate laws and regulations have done no better and, in some years, worse than the rest of the nation, but they are increasing the price of electricity, fuels and natural gas. Other states have produced actual emissions reductions by pursuing alternative and generally less costly approaches.

Meanwhile, regulators and the governor are doubling down on their expensive policies that are driving up the cost of living. According to the Energy Commission, currently, our unique gas adds 15 cents to every gallon sold in California. In just a few months, CARB expects that cost could increase by another 47 cents per gallon. Eventually, this program could increase by a total of $1.83/gallon -- and both are CARB estimates in constant 2021 dollars that do not account for inflation-on top of the other environmental fees and taxes that are already the highest in the nation.

At a time when Californians are paying more for electricity, housing, food, and other necessities they cannot afford a 50-cent increase per gallon, let alone nearly two dollars more.

The bottom line is that California's policy choices are driving the high cost at the pump, and they're continuing to do so. It might be easier to play the blame game, but the facts are the facts -- the state of California makes a lot more money off a gallon of gas than oil companies do.

These facts aren't refuted by regulators (in fact, they're the ones who publish them), or even politicians.

Published as part of the ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2024.

This box describes liquidity conditions and the Eurosystem monetary policy operations during the seventh and eight reserve maintenance periods of 2023. Together, these two maintenance periods ran from 1 November 2023 to 30 January 2024 (the ""review period"").

Excess liquidity in the euro area banking system continued to decline during the review period. This was due to the maturing of the sixth operation under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III.6) and early repayments by banks of other TLTRO funds on 20 December 2023. Liquidity provision also declined, owing to lower asset purchase programme (APP) holdings as a result of the discontinuation of APP reinvestments at the beginning of July 2023. The reduction in liquidity provision was partly offset by the continuing fall in net autonomous factors - owing mainly to lower government deposits - seen since the ECB's policy rates were lifted out of negative territory in July 2022.

The average daily liquidity needs of the banking system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve requirements, decreased by €104.1 billion to €1,630.9 billion over the review period. This was due almost entirely to a €102.3 billion fall in net autonomous factors to €1,467.7 billion (see the section of Table A entitled ""Other liquidity-based information""), driven by a decline in liquidity-absorbing autonomous factors and an increase in liquidity-providing autonomous factors. Minimum reserve requirements fell by €1.8 billion to €163.2 billion.

Liquidity-absorbing autonomous factors decreased by €67.1 billion to €2,653.5 billion over the review period, owing primarily to a decline in government deposits and other autonomous factors. Government deposits (see the section of Table A entitled ""Liabilities"") fell by €40.3 billion on average over the review period, down to €182.3 billion. This reflects the continued normalisation of the overall volume of cash buffers held by national treasuries and their greater propensity to place those holdings in the market in response to changes in the remuneration of government deposits with the Eurosystem, as well as lower government deposits, which typically decline at the end of the year. The normalisation of repo market conditions and higher repo rates relative to the euro short-term rate (€STR) also made market investment a more attractive option than deposits with the Eurosystem. The average value of banknotes in circulation decreased by €6.1 billion over the review period to €1,553.7 billion, reflecting the ongoing reduction in banknote holdings observed since the ECB's policy rates were lifted out of negative territory in July 2022.

Liquidity-providing autonomous factors rose by €35.4 billion, to stand at €1,186.2 billion (see the section of Table A entitled ""Assets""). Net assets denominated in euro increased by €18.1 billion over the review period. This was largely the result of a continued fall in liabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euro. This, in turn, reflects changes in the cash management strategies of customers of the Eurosystem reserve management services (ERMS), given the downward revision on 1 May 2023 of the remuneration of deposits held under the ERMS framework. Net foreign assets increased by €17.3 billion, reflecting the reallocation by some national central banks of own assets to foreign reserves.

The average amount of liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments decreased by €200 billion to €5,159.4 billion over the review period (Chart A). This decline is attributable to both a reduction in the amount of liquidity provided through credit operations and the roll-off of monetary policy portfolios.

The average amount of liquidity provided through credit operations fell by €110.8 billion to €457.4 billion over the review period. This decrease largely reflects the decline in outstanding TLTRO III amounts as a result of the maturing of TLTRO III.6 (€37.3 billion), together with early repayments of other TLTRO funds (€61.7 billion) on 20 December 2023, i.e. at the beginning of the eighth maintenance period. At the same time, the overall outstanding amounts of standard Eurosystem refinancing operations - main refinancing operations (MROs) and three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) - fell slightly. This decline is mainly attributable to the outstanding amounts for three-month LTROs falling by €3.8 billion, on average, while those for MROs remained broadly unchanged, at €7.6 billion, compared with the fifth and sixth maintenance periods of 2023. Banks' limited participation in these operations, together with their ability to repay sizeable amounts of TLTRO funds without switching to regular refinancing operations, reflects their comfortable liquidity positions, on aggregate, and the availability of alternative funding sources at attractive rates.

The average amount of liquidity provided through holdings of outright portfolios decreased by €89.3 billion over the review period. This decline was due to the discontinuation, on 1 July 2023, of reinvestments of principal payments from maturing securities under the APP. Under the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the principal payments from maturing securities have been fully reinvested since net purchases were discontinued at the end of March 2022. In December 2023 the Governing Council announced that full reinvestment of principal payments would come to an end in the second half 2024.

Average excess liquidity decreased by €96 billion, to reach €3,528.5 billion (Chart A) over the review period. Excess liquidity is the sum of the reserves that banks hold in excess of their reserve requirements and their recourse to the deposit facility net of their recourse to the marginal lending facility. It reflects the difference between the total liquidity provided to the banking system and the liquidity needs of banks to meet their minimum reserves requirements. After peaking in November 2022 at €4,748 billion, average excess liquidity has declined steadily, owing mainly to the maturing and early repayment of TLTRO III operations, with the discontinuation of reinvestments under the APP also being a contributing factor since July 2023.

The Governing Council kept the three key ECB interest rates unchanged during the review period. The rates on the deposit facility, the MROs and the marginal lending facility stood at 4.00%, 4.50% and 4.75% respectively.

The average €STR remained broadly unchanged during the review period, while maintaining a stable spread with the key ECB interest rates. The €STR traded, on average, 10.2 basis points below the deposit facility rate throughout the review period, close to the average of 9.9 basis points for the reserve maintenance periods of 2023. The lower excess liquidity has therefore not had any upward impact on the €STR so far. The 1.8 basis point end-of-year decline in the €STR was only slightly more pronounced than the 2022 end-of-year effect (-1.5 basis points).

The average euro area repo rate, as measured by the RepoFunds Rate Euro index, continued to trade closer to the deposit facility rate, except around the year-end. The repo rate was, on average, 7.3 basis points below the deposit facility rate over the review period. The 2023 end-of-year decline of 25.5 basis points was significantly less than the 226.8 basis point fall seen at the end of 2022. This reflects the orderly functioning of the repo market, which is due to several factors, including higher net issuance since the beginning of the year, the release of mobilised collateral on the back of maturing TLTROs, a change in market positioning that resulted in lower demand for securities in the repo market, and the decline in outstanding APP holdings.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,-0.0117647058823529,448984829,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?0ef1632c35edede913681bb76af694a4,

The ECB, together with the other central banks of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks, monitors cyclical and structural developments in the banking sectors of the euro area and the EU as a whole, as well as other financial sectors.

The potential impact of systemic risks on the stability of the euro area/EU financial system and its degree of resilience is assessed by using quantitative tools, such as the ECB's macro stress-testing framework, network analysis and other related modelling tools. A macro stress-testing framework is often used to assess in a forward-looking manner the resilience of the banking sector to (adverse) macroeconomic and financial developments.

In the field of financial stability, the ECB also provides analytical support to the European Systemic Risk Board.

With the entry into force of the SSM Regulation on 4 November 2014, the ECB was given macroprudential tools to tackle the emergence of possible systemic risks in the financial system. The ECB has two mandates in the field of macroprudential policy:

The ECB may, instead of the national authorities, apply higher requirements for capital buffers than those applied by the national authorities and apply more stringent measures aimed at addressing systemic or macroprudential risks, subject to the procedures set out in relevant EU law. For example, the ECB may - after notifying national authorities - apply higher requirements for banks':

National authorities have to notify the ECB when they intend to implement or change a macroprudential measure. The ECB assesses the planned measures and can object to them. National authorities consider the ECB's comments before proceeding with the decision.

The regulation of financial institutions and markets forms the foundation for macroprudential policy. The ECB analyses initiatives concerning financial regulation, financial supervision, financial stability arrangements (e.g. financial crisis management and resolution) and other areas of financial services (e.g. accounting) introduced by European and global regulators and supervisors, and gives advice from a macroprudential and financial stability perspective. In particular, the ECB provides regulatory and supervisory input, via ECB/Eurosystem contributions, to legislative proposals at the national, international and EU levels.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,-0.05882352941176472,448984737,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?bff2a4769f7b2c4f45183e6e783e7424,

This includes making the financial system more resilient and limiting the build-up of vulnerabilities, in order to mitigate systemic risk and ensure that financial services continue to be provided effectively to the real economy.

Systemic risks can arise from severe macroeconomic shocks, financial imbalances, including excessive credit growth, leverage and maturity mismatches, and contagion effects.

In order to contain systemic risks, macroprudential policies seek to:

The SSM Regulation assigns macroprudential powers to both the national authorities and the ECB, so responsibility for macroprudential policies is shared (Article 5). Macroprudential policy instruments can be distinguished along three lines:

These instruments make the financial system more resilient by increasing capital and liquidity buffers. Examples include capital buffers for global and other systemically important institutions, the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio. National authorities and the ECB can impose countercyclical buffers to counter the cyclical build-up of systemic risks. Wherever available within the national framework, national authorities can also impose borrower-based measures that restrict lending, namely for mortgages, at the level of the individual borrower.

Macroprudential policy cannot be considered in isolation; there are important interactions between microprudential, macroprudential and monetary policy measures.

Monetary and macroprudential policies interact with each other mainly via their common transmission channel through the financial system, and especially through the banking system. The two policy domains can complement each other in ensuring both price and financial stability.

Macroprudential instruments can be used in a selective and targeted manner to contain financial stability risks, even in an economic environment characterised by low inflation. The euro area institutional setup allows the ECB to reap the benefits of a common information set and consistent analytical framework.

Microprudential supervision and macroprudential policy complement each other through their differing focus. Microprudential policy increases the resilience of individual financial institutions, while macroprudential policy enhances resilience against risks that emerge for the financial system as a whole.

In expressing gratitude for the support received, President Hichilema extended appreciation to His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and acknowledged the stewardship of Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of IHC (International Holding Company). This recognition comes in light of their instrumental roles in ensuring the success of the investment in Mopani.

The collaborative approach, coupled with innovative strategies, is expected to pave the way for sustainable growth and development, ultimately enriching both Zambia and partner countries for generations to come.

The President's remarks signify a commitment to leveraging partnerships and embracing innovation as key drivers of progress in Zambia's mining industry.

Meanwhile in a bid to bolster rural household food security and promote environmentally friendly agricultural practices, over 10,000 beneficiary farmers across five districts in Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia are poised to benefit from crop grain seed banks established in various farmer field schools.

William Funsani, Senior Agricultural Research Officer at the Zambia Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI), highlighted the pivotal role of these initiatives in enhancing food security among rural communities. Funsani noted that farmers have been actively engaged in adopting smart agricultural practices aimed at bolstering food security while being environmentally conscious.

The districts identified for support in promoting climate-resilient crops include Gwembe, Sinazongwe, Choma, Kazungula, and Sesheke. Funsani elaborated on the target crop value chains, which encompass a range of climate-resilient crops such as cowpeas, groundnuts, sorghum, pearl millet, sweet potatoes, and cassava. These efforts are geared towards not only diversifying agricultural production but also ensuring resilience against climatic uncertainties.

The establishment of rural household crop grain seed banks serves as a practical measure to empower local farmers with access to quality seeds, thereby enhancing their capacity to withstand environmental challenges and improve yields. By promoting the cultivation of climate-resilient crops, the initiative seeks to fortify food security at the grassroots level, contributing to the overall well-being of rural communities.

The engagement of farmers in farmer field schools underscores a participatory approach to agricultural extension, facilitating knowledge exchange and skill-building in sustainable farming practices.

However, today, this majestic species stands on the brink of extinction, facing a myriad of threats that have pushed it to the edge.

The hangul, native to the dense forests and high-altitude meadows of the Kashmir Valley, has been an integral part of the region's cultural and ecological heritage for centuries. Revered for its striking appearance and graceful demeanour, the hangul was once a common sight in Kashmir's landscape, symbolising resilience and adaptability.

Unfortunately, the conservation status of the hangul has undergone a drastic decline in recent decades. According to the latest estimates, the hangul population in Kashmir has dwindled to alarming levels, with less than 300 individuals remaining in the wild. This sharp decline has led to the hangul being classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), signalling its imminent risk of extinction.

Today, the primary habitat for hangul is the Dachigam National Park, located near Srinagar. The park's dense forests, alpine meadows, and pristine streams offer ideal habitat for hanguls to thrive, making it an invaluable stronghold for the species' conservation efforts.

Several factors have contributed to the perilous situation facing the hangul population in Kashmir. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to human encroachment, deforestation, and agricultural expansion have significantly reduced the available range of the species..

Efforts to conserve the hangul and mitigate the factors driving its decline have been ongoing for several years. Various governmental and non-governmental organisations, along with local communities and conservationists, have implemented conservation initiatives aimed at protecting the species and its habitat.

Despite these efforts, the future of the hangul remains uncertain. Urgent action is needed to address the underlying threats to the species and ensure its long-term survival in the wild. The hangul's journey from abundance to the brink of extinction serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for concerted action to protect and conserve our planet's precious biodiversity.

The incredible affordability of BYD's new electric car could disrupt the European auto market.Key barriers to EV adoption, like range anxiety and high costs, are tackled head-on.Comparing the new model's features and pricing to current market options.Insight into BYD's strategic move and its potential ripple effects on European manufacturers.The affordability barrier broken

Among the hurdles to electric vehicle (EV) adoption, price and range have loomed largest. Yet, as the electric models evolve to meet and often surpass the benchmarks set by their internal combustion counterparts in terms of reliability, safety, and quality, these barriers are beginning to crumble. Leading this charge is BYD, the world's premier battery manufacturer for EVs, whose vehicles stand out for their impressive autonomy. Contrary to expectations, BYD's strategy isn't solely price-focused, especially for its higher-end models like the Seal and Han sedans, and the Atto 3 and Tang SUVs, which are sold without discounts, challenging rivals like Tesla and European brands head-on.

BYD's strategic silence

However, BYD's silence has been strategic. The announcement of their latest model, the Seagull, priced at approximately $8,900 in China, has sent shockwaves through the industry. This price point is not just aggressive; it's groundbreaking for a vehicle of its caliber -- a compact, well-equipped, four-seater with a 5-door configuration that stands miles apart from smaller, less equipped models like the Citroën AMI or Renault Twizzy. With the Seagull's impending arrival in Europe, despite inevitable price increases due to transport and taxes, staying under the $20,000 mark seems feasible, potentially even dipping below $15,000.

Specifications that surprise

For this price, the Seagull offers battery capacities ranging from 48 kW to 57 kW, translating to a range of between 260 to 316 miles on a single charge -- a stark contrast to competitors like the Dacia Spring's 149 miles or the upcoming Citroën ë-C3's 198 miles range. Standard features include six airbags, electronic stability control, and an electric parking brake. Notably, unlike the Spring and ë-C3, the BYD Seagull comes standard with a large digital display at the center of the dashboard, elevating its interior sophistication.

A crowned champion in China

The Seagull is far from just another ""cheap Chinese EV."" In China alone, 300,000 units have been sold since its launch last April, capturing 9% of the Chinese EV market share. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, a testament to the vehicle's quality and appeal. This development is likely causing sleepless nights for European auto manufacturers, as they face the prospect of a high-quality, affordable EV entering their market. However, BYD's current production capacity, operating at full tilt to meet domestic demand, might offer a brief respite before the Seagull's European landing.

Implications for the European market

The Seagull's entry into Europe could mark a pivotal moment in the automotive industry, challenging established perceptions of electric mobility's affordability and accessibility. BYD's approach, focusing on high-value offerings across different market segments, from premium models to groundbreaking affordable vehicles like the Seagull, showcases a diverse strategy that could redefine consumer expectations and competitive dynamics within the European EV landscape.

As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, BYD's Seagull represents a significant milestone in making electric mobility accessible to a broader audience. This move not only highlights the rapid advancements in EV technology and manufacturing but also signals a shift towards more sustainable transportation options, aligning with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

According to a report, the country has more than half of global Li-ion manufacturing capacity. Despite its stronghold in the electric vehicle market, the country will likely to face competition and lose its market share as other countries also enter into manufacturing EV batteries like India.

The Indian government announced the FAME-II scheme in 2019 to promote hybrid and electric vehicles, and it has been pushing for EV adoption for the past few years. According to a report by Hindustan Times Auto, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) reported that India's push to increase the domestic production of EVs will likely result in large-scale entry of China-based electric automakers into the Indian market. India Electric Vehicle Sales: Country Aiming for 30 Percent of All Vehicle Sales To Be Electric by 2030, Says Care Edge Ratings.

The report highlighted that the global automobile industry had been seeing massive rise in the Chinese auto companies. It further said that these companies had been aggressively trying to capture the electric vehicle markets in different continents with their affordable offerings. The report said that these EV automakers also are supported by the Chinese government.

The GTRI report emphasised that the Chinese automotive industry with such support grew faster in the EV technology and became major electric vehicle exporter and related components. The report mentioned that the renewed policy of India may make the country a hub for EV manufacturing and soon there might be an increase in auto-component imports from China.

The report highlighted that in 2022-23, India imported auto components worth USD 20.3 billion, out of which 30% came from China. The report said that China holds 75% of the world's electric battery production capacity and accounts for 50% of the global vehicle production and exports to market worldwide.

The report hinted that in the coming years, every third electric vehicle could be from Chinese automobile companies, which could be directly done by OEMs or joint ventures with India-based companies. As per the report, the exports of China-based automobile companies declined due to trade restrictions, anti-subsidy probe, and other reasons to the EU and the US and India could offer potential to these companies.

Such reforms are key to raising productivity and employment in the euro area, thereby supporting the growth potential of the euro area in the long run. At the same time, such reforms will contribute to lowering price pressures by enhancing competition and fostering innovation. By making the euro area markets more flexible, they also help countries to adapt faster and at lower cost to economic shocks. The case for structural economic reforms is very strong in a monetary union, such as the euro area, since there are no longer national monetary and exchange rate policies to respond to country-specific shocks and to improve competitiveness.

The economic reform agenda for Europe has been laid down in the so-called Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. In this context, the EU Heads of State or Government (European Council) launched a wide-ranging and ambitious programme of economic, social and environmental reforms in March 2000 covering policies at both the national and the EU level to enhance the standard of living of European citizens. To achieve this goal, the Lisbon Strategy aimed to transform the European Union into a highly competitive and knowledge-based economy while maintaining a high degree of social cohesion and environmental sustainability.

As the results obtained in the first five years of implementation were rather mixed, partly due to a lack of clear focus, the Lisbon Strategy was relaunched in March 2005. While acknowledging the continuing relevance of the social and environmental pillars, the European Council streamlined the governance framework (see below) and refocused the strategy on 'growth and jobs' by identifying four main priority areas:

The institutional framework for implementing the Lisbon Strategy consists mainly of two processes spelled out in Articles 121 and 148 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). These pertain to the EU Council of Ministers' adoption of Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs) and Employment Guidelines (EGs) , which are proposed by the European Commission and cover macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment policies.

In order to improve the consistency of the BEPGs and EGs, and to focus on the implementation of structural reforms, the 2005 reform of the Lisbon Strategy brought the two sets of guidelines together under the single heading of the Integrated Guidelines . The guidelines are endorsed for a three-year period (see below for details). The first three-year period was 2005-07. The second three-year period is 2008-10.

On the basis of the Integrated Guidelines, each EU Member State draws up its National Reform Programme describing key priorities for economic reforms, planned reforms and own targets in a single document. National parliaments, social partners and civil society are invited to participate in the formulation of the programme. This is intended to improve the national ownership of the structural reform agenda of each Member State.

As a complement to the National Reform Programmes, the Commission presents a Community Lisbon Programme covering all actions to be undertaken at the Community level. The implementation of the Community Lisbon Programme largely entails the adoption of Community legislation by the EU Council and European Parliament, on the basis of proposals by the Commission.

The Heads of State or Government hold a Spring European Council every year in order to provide political impetus and direction to the strategy.

In March 2008, a new policy cycle started. The general set-up is always the same: each cycle begins with a strategic report by the Commission which puts forward the priorities of EU economic policy for the ensuing three years. The report is accompanied by a proposal for a set of Integrated Guidelines which is adopted by the Council.

On the basis of the Integrated Guidelines , each Member State puts forward a National Reform Programme and gives account of its progress in autumn of each year in an Implementation Report . The Commission assesses the Implementation Reports in its Annual Progress Report in December. If deemed necessary, the country-specific recommendations (including euro area specific recommendations), which are an essential part of the Integrated Guidelines, may be adopted in the course of the annual review process.

At the end of the third year, the Integrated Guidelines, the National Reform Programmes and the Community Lisbon programme are renewed, on the basis of an overall assessment of progress during the cycle.

Against this background, the EU leaders adopted, at the European Council meeting in June 2010, the 'Europe 2020 Strategy' .

This is the Union's strategy for creating jobs and promoting growth through economic and social reforms, while respecting environmental limitations. Under the three headings of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the strategy covers policy actions at both national and EU level aimed at enhancing the welfare of European citizens.

The ambition of the Europe 2020 Strategy is expressed in five headline targets for the EU (e.g. 75% of 20 - 64 year olds to be employed). On the basis of EU-level targets, Member States set national targets in each area to suit their particular situation, taking account of different starting positions, different growth potentials and country-specific circumstances.

Under the Strategy, Member States will align their economic policies with redrafted Integrated Guidelines adopted at EU level (see below). They will also design structural reform strategies to overcome country-specific growth and employment bottlenecks. At EU level, seven flagship initiatives developed and suggested by the Commission will also support the strategy. One of them is the ' Innovation Union ', which aims to improve the framework conditions and access to finance for research and innovation. Other initiatives focus on areas such as education, competitiveness and raising skill levels.

Three flanking policies at EU level are also foreseen:

The Europe 2020 Strategy is a follow-up to the Lisbon Strategy, which is generally considered to have been only moderately successful, mainly because of weak governance arrangements, a lack of clear focus and deficiencies in communication. The Europe 2020 Strategy tries to correct these weaknesses, most importantly by giving the European Council a strong role in steering the implementation of the reform agenda and by reinforcing the surveillance of Member States' reform policies.

The Treaty stipulates that Member States are to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. The institutional framework for implementing the Europe 2020 Strategy consists mainly of two processes spelled out in Articles 121 and 148 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). These pertain to the EU Council of Ministers' adoption of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) and Employment Guidelines (EG) , which have been proposed by the European Commission and cover macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment policies.

Since 2005, the two sets of guidelines have been brought together under the single heading of the Integrated Guidelines. They were revised in July 2010 as part of the adoption of the Europe 2020 Strategy and also contain a specific guideline for the euro area. They are endorsed at the highest political level by EU leaders.

The Integrated Guidelines set out the framework for the strategy at Member State level. On the basis of the guidelines, each EU country draws up its National Reform Programme (NRP) setting out in detail the economic reforms it will take under the new strategy, with a particular emphasis on efforts to meet the national targets and to remove the bottlenecks that constrain sustainable growth at national level.

National parliaments, social partners and civil society are invited to participate in the formulation of the programme. This is intended to improve the national 'ownership' of the structural reform agenda of each Member State. Building on monitoring by the Commission and surveillance by the Council, every year the European Council will assess the overall progress achieved both at EU and national level in implementing the strategy in line with the timetable of the European Semester.

A key new element of the governance of the Europe 2020 Strategy is the introduction of a ""European Semester"" which started in January 2011. Under this new process, both economic and fiscal policy coordination - i.e. the two strands of economic surveillance in the EU - will be aligned, while remaining legally separate. Macroeconomic, structural, and competitiveness developments and overall financial stability will be examined simultaneously in order to enhance the overall consistency of policy advice to Member States.

The European Semester starts in January with the publication of a European Commission report, the Annual Growth Survey , which aims to identify the main policy challenges for the EU and the euro area as a whole. An annual economic summit of the European Council in March then provides strategic guidance on policies to be taken into account by Member States in their stability and convergence programmes (SCPs), which are submitted in April. In parallel, and as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy to strengthen growth and employment, Member States identify in their NRPs the appropriate reform strategy to foster employment and sustainable, socially inclusive economic growth.

Based on the SCPs and the NRPs, the Council issues policy recommendations focused on the following year, before national budgets are finalised in the autumn. Finally, the cycle ends with the publication of the Annual Growth Survey in the following year, in which the Commission assesses the extent to which Member States have taken EU recommendations into account.

The Euro Plus Pact was agreed by euro area leaders in March 2011. It aims to further strengthen the economic pillar of monetary union by improving competitiveness and enhancing economic policy coordination, thereby leading to a higher degree of convergence. Several non-euro area countries have joined the Pact on a voluntary basis (Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania) and the Pact still remains open to the other four non-members (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden and the UK).

The Pact focuses primarily on areas that fall under national competence and are key to increasing competitiveness and avoiding harmful imbalances. The common policy objectives are: fostering competitiveness and employment, contributing further to the sustainability of public finances and reinforcing financial stability.

The countries that have signed up to the Pact are committed to including specific policy actions in their SCPs and NRPs to reach these goals within the next 12 months. The choice of actions to achieve the common objectives remains the responsibility of each country.

The implementation of commitments and progress towards the common policy objectives will be monitored politically by the heads of state and government of the euro area and participating countries on a yearly basis on the basis of a series of indicators. The commitments reflected in the NRPs and SCPs will also be assessed by the Commission, the Council and the Eurogroup in the context of the European Semester.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,0.2941176470588236,448983943,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?06035f12747458d70b9eefbe7a314429,

The emergence of possible systemic risks in the financial system is addressed through macroprudential policies. The overarching goal of macroprudential policy is to preserve financial stability.

Financial stability can be defined as a condition in which the financial system - which comprises financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures - is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances.

Selected areas of focus:

General area of interest: the natural rate of interest has declined significantly over the last few decades.

The transmission mechanism is characterised by long, variable and uncertain time lags. Thus it is difficult to predict the precise effect of monetary policy actions on the economy and price level.

The chart below provides a schematic illustration of the main transmission channels of monetary policy decisions.

The central bank provides funds to the banking system and charges interest. Given its monopoly power over the issuing of money, the central bank can fully determine this interest rate.

The change in the official interest rates affects directly money-market interest rates and, indirectly, lending and deposit rates, which are set by banks to their customers.

Expectations of future official interest-rate changes affect medium and long-term interest rates. In particular, longer-term interest rates depend in part on market expectations about the future course of short-term rates.

Monetary policy can also guide economic agents' expectations of future inflation and thus influence price developments. A central bank with a high degree of credibility firmly anchors expectations of price stability. In this case, economic agents do not have to increase their prices for fear of higher inflation or reduce them for fear of deflation.

The impact on financing conditions in the economy and on market expectations triggered by monetary policy actions may lead to adjustments in asset prices (e.g. stock market prices) and the exchange rate. Changes in the exchange rate can affect inflation directly, insofar as imported goods are directly used in consumption, but they may also work through other channels.

Changes in interest rates affect saving and investment decisions of households and firms. For example, everything else being equal, higher interest rates make it less attractive to take out loans for financing consumption or investment.

In addition, consumption and investment are also affected by movements in asset prices via wealth effects and effects on the value of collateral. For example, as equity prices rise, share-owning households become wealthier and may choose to increase their consumption. Conversely, when equity prices fall, households may reduce consumption.

Asset prices can also have impact on aggregate demand via the value of collateral that allows borrowers to get more loans and/or to reduce the risk premia demanded by lenders/banks.

For example, higher interest rates increase the risk of borrowers being unable to pay back their loans. Banks may cut back on the amount of funds they lend to households and firms. This may also reduce the consumption and investment by households and firms respectively.

Changes in consumption and investment will change the level of domestic demand for goods and services relative to domestic supply. When demand exceeds supply, upward price pressure is likely to occur. In addition, changes in aggregate demand may translate into tighter or looser conditions in labour and intermediate product markets. This in turn can affect price and wage-setting in the respective market.

Changes in policy rates can affect banks' marginal cost for obtaining external finance differently, depending on the level of a bank's own resources, or bank capital. This channel is particularly relevant in bad times such as a financial crisis, when capital is scarcer and banks find it more difficult to raise capital.

In addition to the traditional bank lending channel, which focuses on the quantity of loans supplied, a risk-taking channel may exist when banks' incentive to bear risk related to the provision of loans is affected. The risk-taking channel is thought to operate mainly via two mechanisms. First, low interest rates boost asset and collateral values. This, in conjunction with the belief that the increase in asset values is sustainable, leads both borrowers and banks to accept higher risks. Second, low interest rates make riskier assets more attractive, as agents search for higher yields. In the case of banks, these two effects usually translate into a softening of credit standards, which can lead to an excessive increase in loan supply.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,0.1529411764705881,448983847,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?06035f12747458d70b9eefbe7a314429,eng-9419070

This is because FMIs can be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and credit losses, or, given the high level of interconnectivity, a major channel through which these shocks can be transmitted across domestic and international markets, putting financial stability at risk.

The threat of cyberattacks is further accentuated by their dynamic, evolving nature and because they are borderless. It is therefore essential that financial institutions and FMIs have an adequate level of cyber resilience to ensure their own safety as well as that of the entire ecosystem.

The ECB is responsible for overseeing a number of systemically important payment systems (SIPS) operating in the euro area. As these systems clear and settle payments across Europe, they are fundamental to the smooth functioning of the financial markets in the euro area.

As an overseer, the ECB needs to ensure that not only the individual SIPS have a strong level of cyber resilience, but the financial ecosystem as a whole is resilient against cyber threats.

A significant amount of work has been undertaken internationally with regard to cyber risk and FMIs. In June 2016, the CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures was published, providing FMIs with guidance on how to establish and operationalise a cyber resilience framework.

At the G7 level, the G7 Cyber Expert Group (G7 CEG) - of which the ECB is a member - is actively focusing on cybersecurity risks for the financial sector. Established in November 2015, the G7 CEG aims to identify and develop fundamental elements of cybersecurity in order to help financial entities address the risk of cyberattacks. The G7 CEG has published the following fundamental elements, representing a major step forward in this field:

In terms of legislation, the European Commission adopted the Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) in July 2016, which contains legal measures and incentives aimed at making the EU's online environment secure by strengthening preparedness, cross-border cooperation, cyber incident reporting and information exchange.

These initiatives all provide the basis for our work at the ECB and across the Eurosystem.

In March 2017 the Governing Council approved the ""Eurosystem cyber resilience strategy for FMIs"". The objective of this strategy is to improve the cyber resilience of the euro area financial sector as a whole by enhancing the ""cyber readiness"" of individual FMIs that are overseen by the Eurosystem central banks, and to foster collaboration among FMIs, their critical service suppliers and the authorities. Specifically, the strategy aims to put the CPMI-IOSCO guidance into practice and comprises three pillars.

The evolving nature of cyberattacks makes it necessary to ensure that payment systems strengthen their individual level of cyber maturity.

Pillar 1 aims to ensure that the CPMI-IOSCO guidance is put into practice in a consistent manner, by implementing a harmonised approach to assessing payment systems in the euro area against the guidance. In addition, the Eurosystem is developing a range of tools that can be used by FMIs to enhance their cyber resilience.

One of these tools is a European red team testing framework, which gives guidance on how to carry out ""friendly attacks"" that mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of real attackers, based on bespoke threat intelligence. These friendly attacks target the processes, technologies and staff of an FMI, without prior warning, in order to test its protection, detection and response capabilities.

Overseers will also use other tools, such as cyber surveys and focused assessments, to assess the level of cyber maturity of Eurosystem payment systems and to develop cyber resilience oversight expectations to provide more detailed guidance to payment system operators.

Given the high degree of interconnectedness in the ecosystem, an FMI depends not only on its own readiness, but also on that of its participants, service providers and interconnected FMIs. Subsequently, it is essential that there is a high level of cyber resilience across the ecosystem as a whole.

Pillar 2 focuses on strengthening the sector's cyber resilience, by understanding the operational interdependencies through sector mapping, fostering cross-border and cross-authority collaboration, establishing effective information-sharing and implementing market-wide business continuity exercises.

To address the growing threat of cyber risk, it is imperative to ensure collaboration among all relevant participants, both regulators and market participants, in a trusted environment.

Pillar 3 aims to ensure regular pan-European cyber forums take place with Board-level participation by regulators and market participants. In this vein, the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for Pan-European Financial Infrastructures has been established.

Mexico will put its security interests first and won't fight drug cartels just because the US wants it to, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday. While admitting that tens of thousands of people are dying due to drug overdoses in the neighboring country, Obrador insisted that Mexicans will not ""act as policemen for any foreign government.""

According to official US data, last year some 70,000 Americans overdosed on the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Washington has named Mexico and China as the primary source countries for the drug and related substances trafficked directly into the US.

""Of course we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl,"" Lopez Obrador told media during a press conference. He noted that it would be a humanitarian effort, highlighting the priority of the security of the homeland. ""Mexico First. Our home comes first,"" the president said.

Last year, Lopez Obrador pointed out that he considers the overdose crisis to be an internal US problem. ""We deeply lament what's happening in the United States - but why don't they fight the problem ... and more importantly, why don't they take care of their youth?"", he asked rhetorically.

US law enforcement officials, for their part, have on numerous occasions blamed Mexican officials for their apparent refusal to cooperate on efforts to target fentanyl labs inside Mexico.

At the same time, critics have blamed the rise in drug smuggling and human trafficking in the US on the Biden administration.

Investors are reassessing their strategies after a pause in the stellar run of dollar-funded trades amid signs the Federal Reserve may not ease as aggressively as previously anticipated. Carry traders borrow in low-yielding countries to invest in higher-yielding assets, often in emerging markets. An ideal funding currency is characterised by low volatility and limited scope to strengthen.

While the yen remains the world's lowest-yielding currency despite the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) exit from negative rates, heightened expectations for its appreciation and volatility may deter borrowers. The yuan compares more favourably to the Taiwan dollar on those metrics and is more attractive than the greenback on both implied yield and volatility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China's managed currency has been kept in a tight range by Beijing this year, with little scope for appreciation given the sluggish economic conditions. A slide below a key support level on Friday (Mar 22) suggested officials are comfortable with a further depreciation in the currency.

The yuan ""has become more of an option for funding with the People's Bank of China in easing mode as the economy struggles to find its footing"", said Brendan McKenna, an emerging market economist and currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.

Low volatility and a stable trading range ""makes a strong case"" for its suitability for carry trades, Goldman Sachs Group strategists including Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a note on Mar 11.

Bloomberg's gauge of eight emerging market carry trades funded by the greenback lost 0.6 per cent so far this quarter, after a 4.5 per cent gain in the final three months of 2023.

Regarding the yuan, ""I wouldn't necessarily say bet on a huge devaluation, but if you want to look to carry trades I think that's a good one, absolutely,"" Olga Yangol, chief strategist, Americas, at Credit Agricole, said prior to the raft of central bank action last week. Yangol said she's long on the Turkish lira and also likes some Asian currencies, but considers the Mexican peso expensive.

The yuan's one-month implied volatility hit its lowest since 2017 earlier this month before rising on Friday. The offshore yuan's interbank interest rates in Hong Kong, a benchmark gauge of offshore yuan's borrowing costs in Hong Kong, has fallen to around 3 per cent, from a peak of nearly 4.5 per cent in September.

An unexpected interest-rate increase in Taiwan last week, which pushed up the policy benchmark to its highest since 2008, may hurt the Taiwan dollar's carry appeal. Still, some analysts believe the hike, aimed at countering inflation, will be the last for this cycle.

Japan's still-low interest rates mean the yen is still considered attractive by some. When the BOJ raised rates for this first time in 17 years last week, Governor Kazuo Ueda made it clear policy would remain accommodative.

Yen overnight indexed swaps are pricing a rise in the BOJ's policy benchmark to around 0.3 per cent in December.

""Carry trades are probably going to remain attractive with the yen as a funder,"" said Nicholas Chia, macro strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. ""This will be conditional on the BOJ keeping rates lower for longer, which I think will be the case.""

This comes as the Zimbabwe dollar has been losing ground against the US dollar, which has seen the exchange rate being noticeably unstable since December last year.

In the recent past, the instability has been driven by several factors including speculative behaviour, an increase in market liquidity and suspected economic saboteurs amid already high demand for foreign currency.

In an interview after touring Bulawayo's manufacturing giants, Arenel Foods and Baker's Inn, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said the monetary policy statement will be released soon.

""We are working on some measures, people should be patient, we will release a monetary policy statement in the not-so-distant future which will deal with volatility and weakness in the currency.

""Just be patient, we want to make sure that we do it right, undertaking some consultation with various stakeholders in the industry, within Government and international organisations, but also some currency experts that we have consulted. We want to make sure that we have all the arsenal of knowledge that is needed to produce a lasting solution to the volatility and weakness of the currency,"" he said.

Early this year, the exchange rate instability resulted in price increases of products and services, putting them beyond the reach of many, but several swift interventions by the Government restored sanity in the market.

Meanwhile, on tackling the informal sector, Prof Ncube said various strategies were in place to ensure they address the challenges of informalisation in the market.

""So we have tried to use the route to market rules to deal with that, which requires formal businesses that are dealing with the informal businesses to require some registration such as value added tax (VAT) registration and at least charge VAT withholding tax and so forth.

""We are using the formal businesses to deal with the informal businesses that has been one strategy. The other strategy has been the intermediated money transfer tax (IMTT) which we believe has gone a long way in formalising some of the businesses that were not paying their taxes,"" he said.

Prof Ncube said the Government was also aware of the challenges of some businesses requiring cash payments thereby escaping the IMTT, while the third strategy was the presumptive tax levied on informal traders, small-scale miners, cottage industry operators, transport operators, hair salons and bottle store owners among others.

""As you can see, it is a combination of things where we are saying if these informal operators operate from a known address let's say it's a huge warehouse and we have seen those businesses around the city.

""So we designate the owner of the building as a tax collection agent and then we have put in place a presumptive tax to say for each individual occupying space in a building please collect US$1 a day, that's the tax. If you do not, you are mandated by the law,"" he added.

The minister said there was also the location tax which he introduced about two years ago, as part of the multiplicity of strategies to try and get to the informal sector.

""It is never easy, someone will always escape. As the Government, we are not concerned about the person who is trying to survive and they are selling something around the corner they are just trying to survive. l do not expect taxes from those individuals frankly, we are looking at the more serious informalised businesses that is where we should be focusing and that is what we are trying to do as the Government,"" he said. - Sunday News",thezimbabwemail.com,news,The Zimbabwe Mail,,-0.01960784313725494,448982961,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mthuli-Ncube-1.jpg?fit=1078%2C642&ssl=1&w=640,

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech. Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added. Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"". But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downwards for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook, who said he had enjoyed an ""outstanding"" meeting with Li. ""I think China's really opening up, and I'm so happy to be here,"" the CEO of the United States' largest smartphone empire told a reporter from CGTN, according to a video posted on one of the state-run broadcaster's social media accounts.

In separate comments published online by state broadcaster CCTV, Cook said Apple would keep increasing its investment in research and development in China. He added that Apple's flagship mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, would hit shelves in China by the end of this year, according to a social media post that carried his remarks in Chinese translation only.

Cook was in Shanghai to open a new Apple store this week, and on Friday discussed the company's expansion plans in China with the country's commerce minister, Wang Wentao. -- AFP",kuwaittimes.com,news,Kuwait Times,https,0.1058823529411765,448982934,1,https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/03/24/89567.jpg,

Renewable energy has just opened a new chapter thanks to a proposal that will dominate the seas as the Greek gods once did. Far from metaphors or literary comparisons, we want to show you a wind turbine that is disturbing just by looking at it. It is as big as the Eiffel Tower and will produce more energy than a complete wind farm.

The WindCatcher is an extremely tall sea renewable energy device that one cannot ignore when standing on the surface. It's an eerie-looking wooden creature seemingly rising out of the ocean. ´

With the height of 650 feet, it decidedly dominates and is 200 feet higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris. There is the triangular platform, which is sustained by a bottom part made of a large amount of wood, which is attached to the seabed.

With this 3-legs of stability, a hollow trunk with wooden trunk springs out of the ground and rises up to a height of about 1000 feet. The trunk has holes and openings, which serve as wind passage.

The WindCatcher deploys state-of-the-art wind power turbines that have undergone specialized offshore technology development. Even at the core of the system there are a number of wind turbines, each one has a horizontal axis mounted on a platform that is balanced on all sides ensuring the safety of the system.

These units have a three-blade fan part which spins as the breeze blows towards them. Simply the rotor blades turning at thousands of revolutions per minute at the blades, driven by the Bernoulli principle which is the pressure created by the air in motion, this is the one responsible to driving the internal drive shaft connected to the generator.

Electricity is produced from mechanical rotational energy by using strong and purpose-built generators with permanent magnetic fields. Increasing control systems and sensors are in place at the turbines enabling them to orient themselves into the wind optimally holding power output at the maximum.

The balancing points of the sail are located on a floating platform that provides stability and holds the structure upright in the open ocean. This is a mega foundation made of iron or concrete and shaped like a huge, inverted V.

At the point of intersection of the two edges of V is the Windcatcher tower base but the concave arms provide the stiffeners and the turbines. The platform will be secured through chains of long moorings and soil weighted with drag embedment anchors to counter the crashing waves.

Bearing in mind the floating type of Windcatcher it may be placed far offshore, far from anyone's view and nature. It is quite fascinating that the ocean waves, beside their original purpose of generating power for the turbine, also play an auxiliary role in creating extra power for it.

It will need to be able to cope with the severity of marine conditions, such as high waves, corrosion from sea water, and storms. The reacting float system uses complicated force and water control systems, and balance tanks is a necessity as water is shifted.

At this point, a question inevitably arises: how could we use this generator to advance renewable energy without degrading the seas? The truth is that we are doing little to counteract the acoustic and environmental impact on aquatic ecosystems. However, it is also obvious that the land surface is insufficient for these means.",ecoticias.com,news,ECOticias.com,,0.0980392156862746,448982867,1,https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/renewable-energy-iflscience.com_.jpg,

Instead, they were required to attend a mandatory remote operational meeting, only to be blindsided by devastating news -- their jobs were being terminated en masse.

One such employee, a mechanical engineer who requested anonymity, expressed his disbelief at the sudden events. ""The news felt like a punch in the gut,"" he lamented. Others echoed his sentiments, finding themselves abruptly unemployed after years of dedicated service to the company.

Stellantis, however, maintains that these actions were necessary to ""better align resources while preserving the critical skills needed to protect our competitive advantage."" In a statement to FOX 2 Detroit, the company emphasized its commitment to implementing its EV product offensive and Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.

Yet, employees and industry experts alike speculate that the real motive behind the mass firings may be tied to outsourcing practices. According to some workers, Stellantis has been increasingly outsourcing jobs to countries like India, Mexico, and Brazil under the guise of cost efficiency and profitability.

As hundreds of employees grapple with unemployment uncertainty, questions arise about the broader implications for the auto industry. An automotive reporter at Fox 2 highlights carmakers' challenges, including the costly transition to electrification and new UAW contracts.

While Stellantis insists that the reductions are necessary for long-term viability, critics argue that the company's actions do not indicate broader economic trends. Other carmakers have also made cuts in recent months, making it clear that the industry is undergoing significant transformation.

The news is a bitter pill for affected employees, especially considering the government bailout the company received during the bankruptcy era. As Stellantis moves forward with its restructuring efforts, the ripple effects of these mass firings serve as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the automotive industry and the challenges ahead.",webpronews.com,news,WebProNews,,0.04313725490196085,448982412,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-24-at-9.04.54-AM.jpg?fit=1094%2C668&ssl=1,eng-9418400

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

The leading cryptocurrency closed the session at $65,587.76 partially recovering from a 2.57% loss incurred.

The decline in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provided a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin's price trajectory, contributing to the cryptocurrency's modest gains. Throughout the week, GBTC witnessed a notable decrease in net outflows, reaching its lowest point on Friday at $169.9 million compared to $358.8 million on March 21. This downward trend signaled a positive sentiment among investors as the trading week drew to a close.

However, despite Bitcoin's overall gain, the BTC-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market experienced significant net outflows totaling $887.7 million for the week ending March 22. Both the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw declines in net inflows compared to the previous week. IBIT's net inflows plummeted to $828.3 million, while FBTC observed a decrease to $79.4 million.

The divergence in investor sentiment was evident, with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Although the index increased marginally from 73 to 74 on Sunday, it remained within the Greed Zone. However, further losses in Bitcoin could prompt a transition towards the Neutral zone, potentially impacting investor confidence.

while the decline in outflows from GBTC offered a positive outlook for Bitcoin, the broader trends in the BTC-spot ETF market and investor sentiment underscored the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors remained vigilant, closely monitoring market dynamics and key indicators to gauge the direction of Bitcoin's price movements in the near term.

Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains steadfast in his optimism despite the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. His recent actions and statements reflect a deep conviction in Bitcoin's potential as a superior asset class. Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin's advantages over traditional assets like gold, asserting that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold as the preferred store of value.

Saylor's perspective on Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy amidst a landscape where celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrencies have become less frequent. Unlike the previous bull market, where numerous high-profile figures endorsed various cryptocurrencies, Saylor's consistent support for Bitcoin stands out.

MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, made headlines recently with its substantial purchase of an additional 12,000 BTC, amounting to approximately $821.7 million.

This acquisition was funded through convertible notes and excess cash and was executed at an average price of $68,477 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 205,000 BTC, representing an overall investment of about $6.91 billion. This accumulation of Bitcoin underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition.

Moreover, Saylor's influence extends beyond the realm of traditional finance and into popular culture. With rapper Drake's recent Instagram post about Bitcoin, the digital asset space is likely to garner increased public attention. This intersection of finance and entertainment underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1058823529411765,448982342,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9417954

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards 'high-quality' growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the 'transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so'.

The Bulgarian economist warned that 'this transformation would not be easy', but argued that 'with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario', according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take 'decisive steps' to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for 'market-based corrections' in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost 'the spending power of individuals and families' by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen 'the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises', a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would 'take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery'.

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downward for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of 'around five per cent' -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Participants covered various topics, including mainstreaming child protection, children's rights, legal standards, regional and global frameworks and Somalia's national framework for the protection of children.

Ferdinand Nintunze, the Senior Case Management, Processes and Database Officer for ATMIS at the AUCF, reiterated the Mission's commitment to safeguarding vulnerable populations, particularly children.

""Children are integral to the civilian population, and thus, the training aims to equip Ethiopian troops with skills to protect and advocate for children's rights,"" said Nintunze.

Maj. Aman Wako, ATMIS Chief of the Joint Operations Centre in Baidoa, described the training as informative and interactive, expressing gratitude to ATMIS for organising such valuable training sessions.

""We gained a lot from the training, especially regarding child protection in conflict. We thank ATMIS for facilitating such a valuable training, and I hope similar sessions will continue in the future for our benefit,"" said Maj. Wako.

One of the participants, Lance Corporal Atsede Hailu Tulu, acknowledged the knowledge gained and called for similar training sessions in other ATMIS sectors.

""Personally, and as a group, we have learned a lot. I hope such training sessions continue in the future to improve our operational efficiency,"" said Lance Corporal Tulu.",socialnews.xyz,news,Social News XYZ,,0.1607843137254903,448981879,1,https://www.africa-newsroom.com/africarc/loganalytics?press_id=296701&press_source=African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS),eng-9421695

The latest edition of the Asia Bond Monitor said that sustainable bonds in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) members, China, Japan, and South Korea, collectively as ASEAN+3, reached US$798.7 billion by the end of 2023, accounting for around 20 per cent of global sustainable bonds.

By the end of 2023, the global sustainable bond markets had reached US$4 trillion, bringing environmental and social benefits to the countries through sustainable bonds financed projects and programs.

ASEAN sustainable bond issuance made up a higher share of local currency financing and long-term financing in 2023, driven by public sector participation, ADB Chief Economist Albert Park said.

The report also said financial conditions in emerging East Asia improved marginally between Dec. 1 and Feb. 29, as the US Federal Reserve was expected to ease its monetary stance.

The DMO disclosed that this amount encompasses both domestic and external debt stocks of the federal government, the 36 state governments, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Notably, there has been a significant increase of N9.43 trillion compared to the figures reported in the third quarter of 2023.

Explaining the surge, the DMO attributed it primarily to fresh domestic borrowing by the federal government aimed at financing the deficit in the 2024 budget, coupled with disbursements from multilateral and bilateral lenders.

""Total domestic debt stood at N59.12 trillion, representing 61 percent of the total public debt stock, while external debt amounted to N38.22 trillion, constituting the remaining 39 percent,"" stated the DMO.

Furthermore, the DMO highlighted that Nigeria's external debt composition is skewed towards loans from multilateral and bilateral sources, aligning with the country's debt management strategy. Multilateral loans accounted for 49.77 percent, and bilateral loans constituted 16.02 percent of the external debt stock.

""This equates to a total of 63.79 percent, primarily concessional and semi-concessional loans. While the DMO continues to implement best practices in public debt management, the recent and ongoing revenue enhancement efforts by the authorities will bolster debt sustainability,"" The DMO said.

The rising debt profile is spurred by certain states' disproportionately high levels of public debt. Lagos, Delta, and Ogun states stand out with the highest debt amounts, while Ebonyi, Kebbi, and Jigawa recorded the lowest debt stock.

With the public debt stock at N97.341 trillion, the individual debt burden borne by Nigerians is estimated at a debt stock per capita of N446,000. This is in consideration of Nigeria's estimated population of 218 million people, according to World Bank Open Data.

Concerns have continued to grow about Nigeria's rising debt portfolio, especially as it significantly gulps the nation's revenue generation. The federal government said it plans to allocate a substantial N8.25 trillion for debt servicing in 2024. This amounts to approximately 45 percent of the projected revenue and 29 percent of the anticipated expenditure for the fiscal year, fuelling concerns over the sustainability of Nigeria's debt trajectory.

The potential impacts of such high public debt on Nigeria's economy are manifold; with economists warning that it can exert upward pressure on interest rates, crowd out private sector investment, and constrain government expenditure on critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Furthermore, they note that excessive debt servicing obligations divert resources away from productive investments, hindering economic growth and development.

Against this backdrop, stakeholders are calling for prudent fiscal management and strategies to enhance revenue generation to mitigate the risk of debt distress. They note the urgent need for prudent fiscal management, enhanced revenue generation, and effective debt management strategies to mitigate the risks of debt distress and safeguard Nigeria's economic future.

It comes from a department store that sells old-fashioned telephones or heavy gardening tools at high prices. However, quite a few customers like the solid milled parts of yesteryear. It's the same with cars. Not everyone wants huge touchscreens or electric drives.

So it's no wonder that Dacia's rather simple but attractive models are finding more and more fans. And not just because of the favourable prices. Our report that the VW Touran is still available to buy new also caused quite a stir. That's what people want: a practical van for the family. Without the fuss.

Which brings us to the question of which other new cars have been on the market in Europe for a long time. The decades-old veterans such as the Lada Niva or the first Land Rover Defender have disappeared, the Mercedes G is visually old, but not technically. However, the current long-running favourites are not just small cars that have to live forever for cost reasons.

If you don't want to scroll endlessly, click here to go to the individual brands:

Starting with the small Milano as the brand's first electric car, Alfa Romeo will completely renew itself. A new Giulia will make its debut in 2026, utilising the Stellantis Group's STLA Large mixed platform with electric and combustion engines. Although the current Giulia will still look stylish by then, it was launched in May 2016.

No real innovations for three years, Audi's ""Vorsprung durch Technik"" is melting away. The best example is the Audi A4. The estate and saloon have been on the market since the end of 2015, but the successor will not be presented until 2024. This changes the number scheme and becomes the A5 Avant and A5 Sportback.

The small SUV Q2 has been available since summer 2016 and production will end at some point without a successor. Even older is the Q2's big brother in the form of the second generation of the Q7. This has been on the market since June 2015.

There were times when Bentley built the same models for a very long time, but that was a long time ago. The oldest representative in the current range is currently the Bentayga, which has been available since the beginning of 2016. Like almost all of the old masters listed here, it has also been given a facelift.

Caterham from the UK is a special case. They have been building the Lotus Seven since 1973 with hardly any visual changes. New models with modern engines from Suzuki and Ford made their debut in 2021 and 2022 with the 170 S and 340.

One of the oldest model ranges on the European market is that of Fiat. The record holder is the 500 with a combustion engine, which has been available since 2007, but whose last hour is likely to come soon. The current Panda was launched in 2012. The brand recently upgraded it to the Pandina and, according to the management, it will continue to roll off the production line until 2027.

The Jeep Renegade, which was launched in 2014, is also indirectly a Fiat, which is why it is often seen on Italian roads. It shares its technology with the 500X.

The Kia brand is pushing ahead with electric cars, but many combustion engines are no longer the youngest. The frontrunner in this respect is the Picanto, which has been on sale since spring 2017. Thanks to a major facelift for 2024, the small car will probably live on for quite some time.

If you want to make fun of the lack of distinctiveness of some Land Rover models, you can tear your tongue out. The oldest model in the current range is the Discovery, which was launched in September 2016.

Folgore or Grecale, the Maserati range currently includes some aged models. For example, the Ghibli, which was presented back in 2013. The Quattroporte was similarly old, with production reportedly coming to an end at the end of 2023.

Mazda 's latest model in Europe is the CX-60, which was launched in 2022. The rest of the model range is getting on in years: the classic 2 has been around since the beginning of 2015, the 6 even since 2013. The MX-5, which was first presented in 2014, occupies a certain special position; as a fun car and brand icon, it is certain to have a long life, especially as it still looks quite fresh.

Speaking of special status, it's a similar story with the Mercedes G. The basic visual features of the off-roader are still very reminiscent of the original model from 1979, but the G was given a massive technical overhaul in 2018. Further modernisation is planned for 2024. Commercial vehicles also have a long model cycle, as the recently facelifted V-Class has been around since 2014.

Oldie, but Goldie: Mitsubishi still offers the small Space Star in some countries (e.g. Germany) more than ten years after its market launch in April 2013 and quite successfully at that. The reason for this is continuous model updates and a favourable price, which currently starts at €13,590.

Despite the existence of the Megane E-Tech Electric, its combustion-powered brother has been in the Renault model range since 2016. However, its days are probably numbered, just like those of the Twingo. While the current model is still based on the Smart Forfour, a new, purely electric Twingo with a retro look will be available in 2026 for around €20,000.

Is it Spanish scrap metal recycling from Volkswagen? That would be too harsh a judgement for Seat, even though the Ibiza has been on the market since 2017 and the Ateca since 2016. But in practical tests, both prove to be pleasant everyday companions, precisely because they are pleasantly old-fashioned, especially on the inside. And there is also usually some room for manoeuvring when it comes to price.

The smallest car from SsangYong is also the oldest. The Tivoli has been around since 2015. It recently received a visual upgrade, but the base price remains the same: a good €25,000 with a 163 PS petrol engine. In Spain, €18,000 is enough, as the SUV is also available there with 135 PS.

Suzuki 's range of new cars in Europe is also quite dated. The Ignis will soon be discontinued, but not the Vitara, which has been on sale since 2015.

Tesla likes to present itself as particularly progressive, but has a real Methuselah in its programme. The Model S was launched back in summer 2013. There is no real successor in sight.

Though rallies in stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have been the market's main individual drivers in 2024, the financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500's 9.7% year-to-date gain. That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.

A belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps. That view received a boost from the Fed earlier this week, when the central bank expressed confidence it would be able to tamp down inflation and cut interest rates this year, even as it raised its forecast for how much the U.S. economy will grow.

""There is more confidence that the Fed is going to be able to ... get inflation approaching their longer-term targets without a recession,"" said Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, which is overweight the technology, financial and industrial sectors. ""You are going to take a little bit more comfort that you can own a bank or an industrial if you think the Fed is going to lower rates at some point here.""

Investors in the coming week will be watching Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index that will offer the latest read on inflation. The end of the first quarter also could prompt volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios.

The broadening rally contrasts with last year, when uncertainty over the economic outlook prompted investors to seek shelter in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, drawn by their dominant industry positions and strong balance sheets. Only the sectors that housed megacaps - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - outperformed the S&P 500's 24% gain last year.

This year, the financial and industrial sectors are up 10.1% and 9.9%, respectively, while energy has gained 10.3%.

More broadly, the Magnificent Seven - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500's gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year.

The wider rally ""means that leadership isn't so concentrated and susceptible to a correction,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.

After the Magnificent Seven all posted huge gains in 2023, performance among them has diverged more this year, giving investors another reason to look at the rest of the market.

Enthusiasm over artificial intelligence has helped fuel a 90% gain in shares of Nvidia so far this year, while Microsoft has gained 14.5%. On the other side of the ledger, Apple and Tesla are down about 11% and 32%, respectively, for the year.

The latest blow for Apple came this week when the Department of Justice alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, highlighting the regulatory risks that could make investors wary of Big Tech.

In another sign of broadening, more S&P 500 stocks are outperforming the benchmark, 180 so far this year as of Thursday versus 150 last year.

Some corners of the market, such as small caps, still look subdued. The Russell 2000, which is focused on smaller companies, is up just 2.2% year-to-date.

Some investors believe the group could get a boost from the Fed's outlook, which kept in place a previous forecast of three 25 basis-point interest rate cuts, despite the central bank's upgraded growth projections.

""As the Fed starts to lower interest rates, that creates liquidity and makes financing easier,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. ""Who's most advantaged? Not the megacap stocks that have unfettered access to capital no matter what rates are, but really the smaller, lesser-known names.""

The broadening trend could take a hit if the economy begins floundering or runs too hot, upsetting the so-called Goldilocks narrative that has supported markets in recent months.

Some investors also believe the market is due for a pullback after a run in which the S&P 500 has gained 27% since late October.

Others, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.

""The market is broadening out,"" he said. ""You're just seeing that there's more ways to make money this year than the Mag 7.""",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4352941176470588,448981662,1,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/SP500StandardandPoors500Index_800x533_L_1657544297.jpg,

But, thanks to its Mulliner custom division, finances are good","Bentley has a problem. Truthfully, it's the kind of problem every manufacturer would like to have, but it's a problem nonetheless. The company has stretched itself thin, offering the most outlandish customizations buyers could want. While demand has exponentially bolstered Bentley's finances, the company is facing struggles as it tries to keep up.

The Mulliner name has been associated with Bentley for decades, but in 2014, the division was tasked with catering to customers who wanted to add something a bit more special to their new cars. To put it into perspective, it took Mulliner seven years to shift 1,000 commissions, with the milestone being set in 2021. In 2022 the company recorded more than 500 Mulliner commissions in a single year. The company reported a further 43 percent increase in 2023.

Also: Bentley Mulliner Shows How They Are Building The First New Customer Speed Six Since 1930

And while Bentley did see a downturn in overall units sold last year, finances and profitability were propped up thanks to the extensive range of customization the company offers. And when we say extensive, we mean it -- there are a staggering 46 billion different configurations within the standard range.

""Customers demanded it, we've streamlined production, and it's experiencing exponential growth,"" Bentley's (now former) CEO Adrian Hallmark told reporters during a call discussing the company's financial results, as reported by Bloomberg, just days before he abruptly announced stepping down to take over the reins of another luxury British firm, Aston Martin.

""On just a few thousand more cars than we used to sell in the 2000s, we're now making three to four times the profit per year,"" Hallmark stated. He also noted that last year, over 70% of Bentleys purchased were equipped with content from the Mulliner business - and that's in addition to the standard €39,000 (about $43,000 at current exchange rates) worth of options the company sells per car.

While the company enters into a new era, after its CEO resigned, there are still challenges ahead. Bentley has had to put plans for its first BEV on ice, delaying the launch by 12 months, into 2026. This is expected to have a knock-on effect on the brand's larger lineup of EV offerings.

Instead, the company has seen promise in hybrids. Much like other premium brands in the VW Group, EV launches will be spaced out. Later this year we'll see refreshed Continental GTs and Flying Spurs, with four new plug-in hybrid models.

Perhaps the biggest worry for the short-term is China. Bloomberg reports that China represents the second-largest market for Bentley. But thanks to increased interest rates, a decline in the property market, and an uncertain economic outlook, sales have taken a dip. And with EVs being a popular option in that part of the world, Bentley will have to hope that its Mulliner division continues to rake it in.",carscoops.com,news,Carscoops,Sam D.

The Ministry of Defense of Russia has reported that Russian artillery and aviation have successfully destroyed storage facilities for ammunition and drones belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF).

According to the Russian defense ministry, ""Operational-tactical aviation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), missile forces, and artillery of the Russian Armed Forces formations have destroyed ammunition and drone storage facilities, four P-18 radar stations for air target detection and tracking, as well as one radio-electronic warfare station.""

The ministry also stated that live forces and military equipment of the Ukrainian army were targeted in 129 areas.

Previously, the Ministry of Defense of Russia announced that the rotation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Northern direction was disrupted by Tula paratroopers.

It was also reported that Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers struck a support point and live forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Southern Donetsk direction.

Earlier reports stated that Russia was destroying expensive Abrams tanks with cheap ""Upyr"" drones.

Contextual information to keep in mind: The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that Russian forces have successfully destroyed storage facilities and equipment belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The report highlights the use of Russian artillery and aviation in carrying out these operations. This development adds to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with tensions escalating in recent months.

Maintaining accurate provider data is essential for operations and fostering positive relationships between health systems and payers. It may seem simple, but it is a complex task critical to ensure fair reimbursement, support network adequacy, and promote quality of care and access to care.

While collaboration between health systems and payers is necessary to improve data accuracy, it can seem to be a nearly impossible task to accomplish without excessive administrative burdens on both sides, especially to meet the No Surprises Act (NSA) 90-day and 48-hour turnaround times. From revenue leakage to physician frustration and burnout, NSA compliance and member satisfaction, and even health outcomes -- there's much at stake when it comes to inaccurate provider data. Now more than ever, automated, agnostic solutions are needed to facilitate data exchange and ongoing updates for payers and providers.

There's a heavy burden for healthcare providers in the United States that requires them to deliver quality patient care while tackling burdensome administrative tasks. In fact, $400 billion is wasted on administrative complexities like navigating prior authorizations and coordinating benefits. That's according to the latest CAQH Index Report's analysis of healthcare expenditures in the U.S. A study by researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and HiLabs found that manually sending directory updates to insurers via disparate technologies, schedules, and formats already costs practices a collective $2.76 billion annually. Not only is this costly, but it takes away from critical time with patients.

In addition to administrative burdens compounding physician burnout, the prevalence of outdated data is leading to missed opportunities to see new patients. When patients are unable to find providers to meet their specific needs, they turn to others who can. Each instance of incorrect data, such as an incorrect zip code, outdated office hours, or enrollment, influences a patient's choice to select a provider. Outdated data directly translates missed opportunities with potential new patients, adding up to significant revenue leakage as time goes by.

Data dynamics and inconsistencies

But providers are not alone in navigating this delicate dance with data. The same study examined the reliability of physician information held within directories of five major national health insurers and found that 81% of entries had inconsistencies. These were most prevalent among address fields and physicians who practice at multiple locations. The high percentage further illustrates the significance of administrative burdens and the ripple effects of not addressing them. This includes preventing declining member satisfaction for payers. Patients want to know the cost deductibles, copays, and network providers so they can make better-informed decisions. Accurate provider data is necessary to ensure clear communication between members and health plans as well as NSA compliance.

Empowering collaboration

Providers, payers, and patients all have a stake in this game. Aside from the administrative waste, there is a significant human cost at play here. Many patients do not have the luxury of waiting for care or for a centralized physician directory proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to come to fruition, which could take years. The infrastructure to accomplish this is woefully lacking. Health systems and payers require more robust technological frameworks to support the transition to a unified provider directory. Agnostic, technology-enabled solutions are the only way to ease data exchange and synchronization processes. These are needed now to overcome the top challenges such as:

Mastering the data dance to maximize value

Addressing these challenges encountered by providers and payers necessitates the adoption of neutral solutions for accurate data exchange. Simplifying, synchronizing, and automating provider data management for payers and providers at scale will help capture billions of dollars in lost revenue and allow providers to maximize the value of their provider network. Embracing data management platforms that centralize data exchange will play a significant role in alleviating provider burdens, enabling better member and patient experiences, and ultimately ensuring better outcomes for everyone.",medcitynews.com,news,MedCity News,,0.3647058823529412,448981424,1,https://medcitynews.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1216856389.jpg,

The government set a gross domestic product growth of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent this year.The Finance chief earlier said the DOF has no new tax proposals, but is recalibrating its existing priority tax measures to guarantee that these are fairer, easier to collect, and more practical while ensuring that these reforms will not translate to unnecessary burden to Filipino consumers and taxpayers.The department focuses on pushing Package 4 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP), which seeks to encourage growth in key financial markets by simplifying the tax structure on passive income and on certain instruments and other financial products.Under Package 4, the interest income tax will be harmonized at 20 percent, while royalties will be maintained according to the existing tax code until 2027, subsequently harmonized and decreased to 15 percent in 2028.The dividend income tax will remain unchanged until 2027, with a proposed harmonization of 10 percent in 2028.The stock transaction tax will gradually be reduced annually by 0.1 percent, from 0.6 percent to 0.1 percent by 2028. The rates on policies of insurance upon property, fidelity bonds and other insurance policies will gradually be decreased annually by 1 percent, from 12.5 percent to 7.5 percent in 2028.Meanwhile, taxes on Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) tickets prizes, and other winnings will have no changes.Taxes on mortgages, pledges and deeds of trust would stay at current rates until 2027, after which they would be lowered to a 0.3 percent rate by 2028.The proposed changes to taxes on passive income, financial intermediaries, financial transactions and excise tax on pick-up trucks are expected to yield P12.2 billion in revenues from the third quarter of 2024 to 2028, versus the P83 billion foregone revenue from the original version of the bill and the P19.3 billion revenue loss from the House version.",manilastandard.net,news,Manila Standard,,0.4039215686274509,448981407,1,https://cdn.manilastandard.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dof.jpg,

Attendees learned more about the University's considerable progress in fields such as modern agriculture and environmental best practices, with key examples of UDSTs horticulture-related technologies on display, alongside six technology-driven interactive activities that visitors can enjoy.

President of UDST Dr. Salem Al Naemi said that EXPO 2023 Doha is not just an exhibition, but a platform for institutions, organizations, and individuals that are intent on shaping a sustainable future.

""We are glad to see that the booth has attracted an impressive turnout. At UDST, we are forging our own path in greener practices and technology. Through our participation in the exhibition, we wanted to broaden the conversation around sustainability in education environments. Our efforts around sustainability at the University are not only about educating our students, but about developing and implementing innovative real-world solutions,"" Dr. Al Naemi said.

The University's initiatives on display at the booth included a weather station, a sustainable greenhouse model, various robots, an agricultural tricycle, a smart trash bin system, and a hydroponic system capstone project. EXPO visitors to the booth had the opportunity to take part in a series of hands-on educational activities such as setting up precision agricultural sensors to monitor soil moisture and temperature, and composting and soil building.

Other activities included assembling a small-scale hydroponic system, where visitors can learn about hydroponic-compatible plants; installing a smart irrigation system; and agricultural 3D printing, complete with design tutorials.

UDSTs participation in Expo 2023 Doha sets an important precedent for educational institutions, with their commitment to ensuring the next generation is prepared to tackle environmental challenges.

Planes with flapping wings sound more anime than aerospace, but the world's largest airframers on both sides of the Atlantic are expediting prototypes that could shape the next generation of business and commercial jets in entirely unconventional ways. Their mission?

To make aircraft exceedingly more fuel efficient and help deliver on aviation's sustainability pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2050. In Europe, Airbus is designing radical wing configurations, including one that changes form to counter turbulence, while stateside, Boeing has partnered on NASA's X-66A experimental plane that relies on trusses to support unusually long and slender wings.

The Extra Performance Wing that Airbus is developing ""mimics a bird's feathers and adjusts automatically to maximize aerodynamic flow,"" says Sebastien Blanc, technical wing director for the project, part of the Airbus UpNext program. Flight tests for the 165-foot-long shape-shifting wing will begin next year on a Cessna Citation VII jet. ""Like a bird, it dynamically adapts to conditions, using active control technologies,"" explains Blanc. And its folding wingtips, an ancillary design, will allow for increased performance while fitting into the constraints of the airport gates.

Thin, elongated wings are also integral to the X-66A, a Boeing concept that NASA greenlighted last year as part of its Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program. Spearheading the $1.15 billion plan across a seven-year timeline, Boeing will modify an MD-90 aircraft by shortening the fuselage and mounting the engines under what it calls a Transonic Truss-Braced Wing, which, as the name implies, relies on a set of aerodynamic trusses.

""Our goal was to develop a more sustainable airplane that can replace current single-aisle aircraft,"" says Brent Cobleigh, NASA's X-66A project manager, adding that the latter account for nearly half of global flight emissions. ""With advanced propulsion and lighter-weight materials, we think it will have a 30 percent reduction in fuel burn.""

The industry's goal to reach carbon neutrality in the next 26 years faces strong headwinds in cost alone. Yet with such out-of-the-box concepts being explored by some of the world's biggest aerospace innovators, others may soon be motivated to earn their own sustainability wings.",robbreport.com,news,Robb Report,Michael Verdon,0.2313725490196079,448981271,1,https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/X66A_Plane2.jpg?w=1024,

New to the program this year is a partnership with live touring series and music discovery platform OnesToWatch, which will add live performances, mentorship, virtual audience engagement and education bootcamps in emerging tech -- including Web3 and generative AI tools -- to the experience.

""Experience"" is the key word here, according to Cheryl Guerin, Mastercard's EVP of Brand Strategy and Innovation. ""One of the things we're not doing is traditional marketing... We consider ourselves an experiential marketer,"" she said. ""And that means we're going to find a way to connect to what matters to people. It's not about us talking at people, it's about us enabling experiences. That creates affection for our brand, and loyalty to our cards.""

Here's our conversation with Guerin about the strategic marketing goals for the accelerator program's second season and how it will engage consumers during the process. Plus, she shares an update on Mastercard's sonic branding strategy, new channels the company is experimenting with, and her approach to differentiating from competitors.

Chief Marketer: What's different about the program this year?

Cheryl Guerin, Mastercard's EVP of Brand Strategy and Innovation: Some things are the same, in that we're focused on bringing fans closer to what they love -- the passion of music -- and then helping emerging artists have a platform to learn and launch their careers. The biggest difference this year is we're bringing it live. We're partnering with OnesToWatch, a platform that has launched tremendous careers for the likes of Dua Lipa and others. Now the artists going through the accelerator program are getting the chance to go on tour with OnesToWatch.

CM: What consumers insights or trends informed this?

CG: Live music is taking off. It had a huge year last year, and it's set to grow even more in 2024. We wanted to make sure we moved them from the studio to the stage, and give them that opportunity to be part of this live music scene.

We're seeing a surge in experiences. We came out of Covid and everybody wanted to move live again. And 2023 saw its biggest year ever for live music. In 2024, that stage is set, and it's likely going to grow as well. So it's based upon those trends.

We wanted to move in this direction also for the emerging artists. You're putting them through a curriculum of education. You're going through boot camps and giving them tech and tools to accelerate their music, and then you're giving them a stage to actually perform on. Last year we had a Billboard virtual concert live tream. People got to create their music and perform their songs, and they had a virtual audience.

CM: What are the strategic marketing goals of the program?

CG: This goes back to our experiential marketing strategy... One of the things we're not doing is traditional marketing. We consider ourselves an experiential marketer. And that means we're going to find a way to connect to what matters to people. It's not about us talking at people, it's about us enabling experiences. And that creates affection for our brand, and loyalty to our cards. As part of that, we're bringing people closer to their passions.

We're also inspiring purpose. Sometimes we're fusing passion and purpose. And in this case, it's the passion of music. The purpose is giving emerging artists and those who may not typically have a chance to be seen a way to inspire and enable their passion of creating music. We get to do both in this case.

CM: And from a business perspective?

CG: Now from a marketing perspective, certainly [there are] the brand goals, but then we're also looking at how we're creating and enabling a community that we're engaging with on an ongoing basis. Five artists go through the program, but over a hundred thousand people got the Music Pass last year, which gave them [virtual] access to watch and learn as the artists went through their journeys. It gave them access to tech and tools, like our genAI music studio, where they can create their own music and songs. And we'll be doing the same this year.

It keeps that experiential engagement going with the artists, with our community that we're creating as well. When we're doing experiential marketing, you're earning media as well. We want people talking about the program and talking about what they're learning and participating and engaging in, and that's a big part of what we're doing.

CM: Talk about the genAI music studio. How is it different this year? How are you leveling up the tech part?

CG: We [think] about the humanity when it comes to genAI. Are we taking away people's creativity? First and foremost, what we learned from our genAI music studio last year was certainly that it's an enhancer and enabler -- and doesn't take away from the creativity. It actually accelerates the creation of the music. It's a nice story for us when we talk about the pitfalls of the concerns people have about eliminating creativity. And with the Music Pass, the genAI studio will allow you to personalize your sound and connect that to it.

CM: Switching gears a bit to sonic branding. Mastercard is a big player in this area. What's the brand's latest direction there?

CG: On the sonic side of things, this is in anything and everything we do. It's part of our branding as much as a visual logo is -- it's there at all times. You see and hear our sonic brand in conjunction with the visual. It's the same with point of sale, [which is] expanded to millions and millions of rotations around the world. At the end of your transaction when you're getting out of a taxi cab in New York City, or if you're pairing your phone to your payment, you hear the sound that goes with it -- a reinforcement of trust that the payment went through. It gives people peace of mind. They also trust the merchant more when they are hearing that sonic brand as well, as our research has shown.

But any piece of communication that we do, you'll always hear it. But it's not just a signature at the end. It's the melodies built into any music track that we have in all of our advertising, for instance. In the case of the songs that the artists are creating, each of them with the AI music studio, they created their songs and infused our sonic branding into them. We also had our music album launch, which you may have heard. And we'll continue on this journey, reinforcing our brands for both the peace of mind moments that are needed as well as the positive reinforcement during experiences.

CM: It's true that more and more companies, particularly in financial services, are adding this kind of sound to reassure customers that transaction has gone through. Apple Pay has a very loud one, for instance.

CG: This is true as well. Think of the transactions as a positive reinforcement. There are more and more channels where your brand might not be seen. In the audio evolution and revolution that's happening, whether that's making a purchase through a smart speaker, through your car or wherever that might be, the brand may not have a visual cue. So, particularly when you're making a transaction that might not be seen, it's even more important for a brand like ours to have that reinforcement. And to recognize that your brand may not always be seen, but if it can't be, it should be heard. Ideally, they're all in combination, working in harmony.

CM: Are there any new channels that you're experimenting with?

CG: This is one of them. You didn't hear me say the ""NFT"" this whole time. That being said, this is a Web3 platform. MasterCard Music Pass is technically an NFT. And this builds on the ability to add to the experiences that we already do. It gives people special access, or a token-gated experience. It's not about the technology. It's just about what it enables now, which adds to our core strategy in the first place.

CM: The fact that you didn't mention NFT: what does that mean to you? Do you usage of NFTs declining?

CG: Even last year, when the hype cycle was there around NFTs, we called it the ""Mastercard Music Pass."" So event then, we tried to focus it around the human experience. It's less about the technology and more about what it enables. When I look at the stats, people are still engaging with NFTs in a big way. The hype cycle has [slowed] down, but it's about utility for brands there. It's creating loyalty and community. So, it has a real purpose.

We also have a Web3 platform called Pass to Price List, and we just enabled another experience at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week. We had a commemorative Arnold Palmer Invitational hat with embedded technology that enabled you to bring up a site to help you navigate the course and show you where you could have priceless experiences. For a Mastercard cardholder, all those experiences -- where you took pictures with golfers, photos with your friends -- they all got captured and now sit in that hat. It's on the blockchain, so you can always access those memories.

CM: Any other genAI initiatives in the works?

CG: In addition to this program, we announced at CES that our small business AI capability is coming soon. It's a conversational chatbot where small businesses can interact, ask questions, get simple answers (or even complex answers) related to tax information, how to start a business, and where to go to for certain needs when managing your small business.",chiefmarketer.com,news,Chief Marketer,Kaylee Hultgren,0.2313725490196079,448981256,1,https://chiefmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/artist-accelerator.png,

Over the years, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has laid out various justifications for his ""hugs, not bullets"" policy of avoiding clashes with the cartels. In the past he has said ""you cannot fight violence with violence,"" and on other occasions he has argued the government has to address ""the causes"" of drug cartel violence, ascribing them to poverty or a lack of opportunities.

But on Friday, while discussing his refusal to go after the cartels, he made it clear he viewed it as part of what he called a ""Mexico First"" policy.

""We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government,"" López Obrador said at his daily news briefing. ""Mexico First. Our home comes first.""

López Obrador basically argued that drugs were a U.S. problem, not a Mexican one. He offered to help limit the flow of drugs into the United States, but only, he said, on humanitarian grounds.

""Of course we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl,"" the president said.

Astronomers have identified two ancient streams of stars - named after the Hindu deities Shakti and Shiva - that appear to be among the Milky Way's earliest building blocks, offering new insight into how our galaxy came together long ago. These structures, found using observations from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope, may be relics of two distinct galaxies that merged roughly 12 billion years ago with the Milky Way's primordial pieces during the galaxy's infancy, the scientists said.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Adient's ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Adient is:

11% = US$307m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

To start with, Adient's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. This probably goes some way in explaining Adient's significant 62% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.

We then compared Adient's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is ADNT worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether ADNT is currently mispriced by the market.

Given that Adient doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.

On the whole, we feel that Adient's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The leading cryptocurrency closed the session at $65,587.76 partially recovering from a 2.57% loss incurred.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows ease, contributing to modest gains

The decline in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provided a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin's price trajectory, contributing to the cryptocurrency's modest gains. Throughout the week, GBTC witnessed a notable decrease in net outflows, reaching its lowest point on Friday at $169.9 million compared to $358.8 million on March 21. This downward trend signaled a positive sentiment among investors as the trading week drew to a close.

However, despite Bitcoin's overall gain, the BTC-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market experienced significant net outflows totaling $887.7 million for the week ending March 22. Both the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw declines in net inflows compared to the previous week. IBIT's net inflows plummeted to $828.3 million, while FBTC observed a decrease to $79.4 million.

Navigating Bitcoin's market sentiment and investor confidence

The divergence in investor sentiment was evident, with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Although the index increased marginally from 73 to 74 on Sunday, it remained within the Greed Zone. However, further losses in Bitcoin could prompt a transition towards the Neutral zone, potentially impacting investor confidence.

while the decline in outflows from GBTC offered a positive outlook for Bitcoin, the broader trends in the BTC-spot ETF market and investor sentiment underscored the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors remained vigilant, closely monitoring market dynamics and key indicators to gauge the direction of Bitcoin's price movements in the near term.

Michael Saylor's perspective and near-term considerations

Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains steadfast in his optimism despite the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. His recent actions and statements reflect a deep conviction in Bitcoin's potential as a superior asset class. Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin's advantages over traditional assets like gold, asserting that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold as the preferred store of value.

Saylor's perspective on Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy amidst a landscape where celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrencies have become less frequent. Unlike the previous bull market, where numerous high-profile figures endorsed various cryptocurrencies, Saylor's consistent support for Bitcoin stands out.

MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, made headlines recently with its substantial purchase of an additional 12,000 BTC, amounting to approximately $821.7 million.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation and influence in popular culture

This acquisition was funded through convertible notes and excess cash and was executed at an average price of $68,477 per Bitcoin.

Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their 'Mission Possible' across the campaign's five key pillars - energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and sustainability leadership.

Across the UK and across the world, leading businesses, cities, states and regions are turning environmental ambitions into action. Here, we round up five positive sustainability stories from this week.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 600 million people in Africa lack electricity access - 43% of the total population. Investment is needed in clean generation and related infrastructure to boost access without locking the region into fossil fuels.

Impact fund manager Camco this week unveiled a new technical assistance facility to support the delivery of its $250m fund for small and medium grid and renewables companies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The fund will support early-stage project preparation and de-risking, and will also provide the finance that startups and scaleups need to share their knowledge and receive strategic support from policymakers and larger firms.

International finance for Camco's work on the energy transition in Africa has been received from the UK Government, the Green Climate Fund and the Norwegian Government.

DHL Supply Chain UK has this week confirmed the introduction of digital technologies to its food service processes for train operator Avanti West Coast, in a bid to reduce food waste.

Monitoring devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) will be used to monitor the temperatures at which fresh food is kept. As such, staff can intervene to adjust the temperature if necessary to reduce waste. Staff will also be able to make data-driven decisions on whether food can still be safely served.

The IoT devices will be mounted to trolleys and require no additional infrastructure. Data from the devices can be accessed using a QR code and through immediate alert channels. He hope is to roll out the devices to all trolleys, of which more than 500 are used each day.

DHL Supply Chain's managing director Dan Peacock said: The significant food waste savings achieved through the introduction of smart IoT devices into our Avanti West Coast operation shows the value of innovation and digital solutions. Nurturing and deploying new technology is part of our commitment to both our customers and the environment.""

National Grid was featured prominently in the news this week for its bold, multi-billion-pound plans to transform Britain's electricity networks for net-zero by 2050, with key ambitions including a new national 'spine' of transmission and distribution infrastructure.

The organisation, which is one of the UK's largest fleet operators, has also this week celebrated the installation of its 1,000 electric vehicle (EVs) charging point as it strives for a pure electric fleet by 2030.

The new charger was added to Wymondley Substation in Hertfordshire as part of a broader partnership with charging solutions specialists ElectrAssure. More than 100 National Grid sites now have charging infrastructure, and the firm operates more than 1,000 EVs.

""Installing our 1000th EV charger is another fantastic milestone because it supports our wider rollout of electric vehicles by ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to build a more sustainable future alongside our customers and communities,"" said National Grid's director of UK land and property Prem Gabbi.

As the nation works to host 70GW of solar by 2035, the UK Government has asked industry and policy experts to plot a course to scale rooftop solar on commercial buildings like warehouses and car parks.

Some organisations are moving ahead of the curve. Wiltshire Council is now just weeks awar from opening a new car park with next-generation glass solar panels on its roof at the Five Rivers Health and Wellbeing Centre in Salisbury, and expects the PV array to meet 10% of the site's electricity demands.

The car park structure, designed and installed by 3ti, is being made from Glulam timber beams. These wood laminations bear a lower carbon footprint that steels, owing to the fact that they are lighter and less energy-intensive to produce. 3ti has also omitted the need for a traditional concrete base or steel piles by using innovative ground anchors.

It is hoped that the solar roof canopies on the 70-space car park will reduce the Council's annual energy spend by around £50,000.

Friday (22 March) was World Water Day, an annual observance held by the UN to raise awareness of the growing need to implement sustainable water management practices globally.

The occasion typically raises less fanfare from the private sector than, for example, Earth Day - but edie still received news of some exciting new water efficiency and stewardship projects. Among them is Chivas Brothers' new partnership with three River Trusts in Scotland, which recognises that one-third of the nation's rivers are suffering from poor ecological health.

The Scotch whisky brand, which is a subsidiary of Pernod Ricard, will financially and practically support protection and restoration on waterways across North-East Scotland, in partnership with The Deveron, Bogie and Isla Rivers Charitable Trust, Findhorn, Nairn and Lossie Rivers Trust, and the Spey Catchment Initiative.

Chivas Brothers' head of sustainability and responsibility Julie Gallacher said: ""Scotland's waterways are the lifeblood of whisky production, so while we use this precious resource responsibly, returning 96% of what we use to its source, we like to think there's a 'river within' each bottle. Many of our distilleries are built on the banks of treasured Scottish rivers and it's from these waters that our renowned whiskies are endowed with their unique spirit, essence and even their names.

""Just as we rely on the rivers, the rivers rely on us. The art of whisky making is a delicate balance, so too is the Scottish landscape in which we craft it. That is why we are proud to launch this partnership with the three River Trusts to protect and build a resilient network of Scottish rivers and riverbanks that support biodiversity for generations to come.""",edie.net,news,edie.net,Sarah George,0.3333333333333333,448980927,10,https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/220324SS.jpg,

The biotech company is testing an injectable treatment that helps people lose weight differently from the existing injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and other obesity medicines in development. Amgen's treatment, called MariTide, also appears to help patients keep weight off after they stop taking it.

The drugmaker is also testing its drug to be taken once a month or even less frequently, which could offer more convenience than the weekly medicines on the market.

It's too early to say how competitive Amgen will be in the budding weight loss drug space, which Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have so far dominated.

Some analysts expect the market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, potentially leaving room for new competitors to enter. Goldman Sachs also projects that between 10 million and 70 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2028.

The available data on Amgen's injectable drug is promising, but it's from a small, early-stage clinical trial. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company also is developing an oral medicine and other treatments for obesity, but has disclosed few details about them.

Investors and health experts will likely get a better idea of Amgen's prospects later this year: The drugmaker expects to release initial data from an ongoing mid-stage trial on MariTide, along with phase one data on its obesity pill.

It's also unclear whether Amgen's treatments will be cheaper than the existing weight loss drugs, which cost around $1,000 per month.

Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Zepbound from Eli Lilly lead a new class of obesity treatments that has drawn unrelenting patient demand -- and investor interest -- despite their hefty price tags and limited insurance coverage.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also struggled to offer enough supply of their treatments, which could give other companies a chance to win market share.

Amgen's drug offers a new twist on weight loss.

Much like Wegovy and Zepbound, one part of Amgen's treatment activates a gut hormone receptor called GLP-1 to help regulate a person's appetite.

But while Zepbound activates a second hormone receptor called GIP, Amgen's drug blocks it. Wegovy does not target GIP, which suppresses appetite like GLP-1 but may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Amgen's decision to tamp down rather than boost GIP activity is based on genetics research suggesting that blocking the receptor is linked to lower fat mass and body weight, company executives have said.

That appears to contradict how Zepbound works. Eli Lilly's approach has proven successful: The treatment helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.

But Amgen's MartiTide also was effective in a small, early-stage study.

Patients given the highest dose of Amgen's drug -- 420 milligrams -- every month lost 14.5% of their body weight on average in just 12 weeks, according to data from the phase one trial published last month in the journal Nature Metabolism.

There's a broader debate among researchers about why both approaches - blocking and activating GIP - are effective at promoting weight loss.

One theory is that repeatedly activating the GIP receptor, as Zepbound does, ultimately causes the body to ""self-regulate"" itself and make sure there isn't too much GIP activity, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, a director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

That decreases GIP activity overall, which is thought to essentially mimic what Amgen's drug achieves when it blocks the GIP receptor. But Apovian cautioned that ""none of this is proven"" and more data is needed.

Amgen's treatment may be better at helping people maintain weight loss than competitors, even though patients take it less frequently, early-stage trial data suggests.

Amgen's study enrolled 110 patients with obesity but not diabetes. Patients in one group were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the drug and were followed for 150 days, while a second group was given a dose every four weeks for three months.

Patients who received a single shot of the highest dose of MariTide lost up to 8.2% of their body weight after 92 days. That suggests a single injection of the drug has a prolonged weight loss effect, according to the study authors.

In the group that received multiple doses of the drug, patients appeared to maintain their maximum weight loss until around two months after their last dose. Their body weight started to slowly return after that. Still, their weight was as much as 11.2% lower five months after they received the last dose.

""We think meaningful weight loss is already 5%. If you take Amgen's drug, lose 14.5%, stop the drug and still have 11.2% weight loss after a few months, that's significant,"" said Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone Health and an obesity medicine physician. But she pointed out the need to study the treatment in a larger group of people.

The sustained weight loss in Amgen's study appears to contrast with results seen in clinical trials on Zepbound and Wegovy. Patients in those studies saw their weight rebound sooner after stopping the injections.

The frequency of Amgen's drug also sets it apart. Those on Wegovy or Zepbound have to take doses weekly, compared with the once-monthly MariTide.

Amgen's trial used monthly dosing in part because patients saw sustained weight loss whether they had a single injection or multiple shots of the company's drug, according to the study authors.

Amgen's treatment also can stay in the body for much longer than current therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound because it includes a monoclonal antibody, the authors added.

Amgen's MariTide ""has that advantage where it's just going to last a lot longer. Even if you give a high dose, you're still going to have drug exposure in the body for a month or two months, so that clearly shows you don't need to take it every week,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC.

Phipps said people typically don't want to get injections often, so some patients could prefer a monthly shot like Amgen's MariTide for a disease that will likely require chronic treatment.

But he noted that a patient's choice may also depend on whether the level of weight loss and side effects of Amgen's drug end up being on par with those of the existing weekly injections.

Amgen's ongoing phase two trial is exploring whether patients can take its drug even less frequently than once a month.

Amgen's longer-term phase two study on nearly 600 patients will provide more clarity on how competitive MariTide will be against Wegovy and Zepbound. The company is exploring which dose strength and schedule is best for patients. It expects to release initial trial results later this year.

Some analysts have said the phase two trial could help address several questions, including how well patients tolerate the treatment at different dose regimens.

The 52-week study is testing 11 different patient groups at a variety of dosing levels and regimens. That includes starting some patients at a lower dose of a drug and gradually increasing it until they reach a higher target dose.

That dose escalation could help reduce side effects that some patients experienced after taking their first dose of MariTide in the phase one trial, according to Phipps.

In that trial, the safety and side effects of Amgen's drug were similar to other GLP-1 medications. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects, and typically lasted for about 72 hours.

Four out of eight patients in a group receiving the highest dose of the treatment withdrew before getting a second shot due to mild gastrointestinal issues, according to the study. But no other patients stopped taking the drug due to adverse events across any of the different dosing groups, Amgen Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said during a conference earlier this month.

""It's a little early to jump to the conclusion that the drug won't be tolerated by patients based on this phase one data,"" William Blair & Company's Phipps said.

Another part of Amgen's phase two trial will also examine weight loss beyond 52 weeks, which will provide a clearer picture of how long the drug is effective.",nbcdfw.com,news,NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth,,0.1058823529411765,448980844,1,https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/02/107368557-17069062502023-12-13t123425z_1803569422_rc26v4aidh6r_rtrmadp_0_health-obesity-telehealth.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,eng-9421616

In Irish media reports this week, Fujitsu announced to its staff that it will no longer seek new business in Ireland, but will honor existing contracts until they expire.

Reports further said that Fujitsu UK and Ireland chief Anwen Owen attributed the move from Ireland based upon a review of the business performance and outlook in Ireland.

""It is with regret that we have taken a difficult decision and plan not to pursue new business in the Irish office,"" Owen said in an email. ""Going forward, Fujitsu plans to refocus its Irish operations on the fulfillment of existing customer contractual commitments.""

Media reports also said Fujitsu was closing its Manchester facility in the UK, which the company has denied.

Fujitsu finds itself in the midst of a scandal with the UK Post Office, known as the Horizon IT scandal, which arose from faulty software, provided by Fujitsu, creating false shortfalls in the accounts of thousands of subpostmasters throughout the UK.

The public outcry caused by the software problems has resulted in an uncertain future for Fujitsu in the UK. Fujitsu has reportedly stopped bidding on new business in the UK, as a public inquiry continues.

According to The Guardian, Kanaan VyShonne Barton is fighting with Brigham Young University (BYU)-Hawaii over their hair policy, which requires students to keep their hair ""neatly trimmed"" under an ""honor code.""

Barton alleges Jonathan Kalaonalani Kau, the vice president of student life, called his locs a ""distraction"" and then instructed the student to cut his hair. The official allegedly accused the Black pupil of ""pushing his own agenda and being defiant.""

Barton pushed back against his school's demands, saying his locs are an integral part of his Afro-Guyanese American heritage.

""Regardless of the length of my hair, I am spiritually involved. I am actively going to church,"" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. ""But my locs mean something to me. They are culture. They are family. I shouldn't have to cut my hair to get an education here.""

According to the grooming policy, student's hair should be ""clean, neat, modest, and avoid extremes in styles and colors,"" reporters found. They also noted that the code doesn't mention anything about hair length. In the meantime, Barton said he's styling his hair to stay above his collar.

BYU and its other campuses operate under The Church of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), which has a history steeped in racism and anti-Black discrimination. Despite revoking discriminatory policies and disavowing their previous religious teachings, many Black adherents today allege both implicit and blatant racist experiences with the church.

Image Credit: Nvidia

On March 18, 2024, a whole new world was born -- a world that was expected to be at least 15 to 20 years away. Nvidia, a global leader in artificial intelligence development, is the starship taking us there. Its CEO, Jensen Huang, is fast on his way to dethroning Elon Musk as our modern world's Oppenheimer.

Taking a leaf out of tech's ultimate showman Steve Jobs' book, Nvidia's leather jacket-clad CEO, Huang, walked onstage to deliver the keynote address at the company's annual GTC (GPU Technology Conference) after an AI introductory spectacle that looked like something that could be played at the start of a post-apocalyptic video game.

""I hope you don't think this is a rock concert,"" were his first words on stage to a massive audience that filled the SAP Centre in San Jose, California, the US, on a dazzling spring day.

Nvidia, an American multinational corporation and technological company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, was founded in April 1993 and was then considered to be revolutionising the world of gaming. While most computer games of that era were CPU-based, Nvidia's founders believed that for computer graphics to advance, a dedicated GPU would be required, and since then, after establishing itself as the number one graphics chip provider for gaming, Nvidia has expanded into high-performance computing and, of course, the buzzword for our times, AI, or artificial intelligence.

Today, it is the world's third-most valuable company by market cap, and certainly their GTC (GPU Technology Conference) was most definitely not pale by comparison to any rock concert, as the premier event for AI innovators, developers, and enthusiasts.

Once held in local hotel ballrooms, in fifteen years it has grown to be the world's most important tech conference, returning to its physical form after five years.

Generative AI promises to transform every industry it touches, and it just needed the technology to meet that challenge.

On Monday, Jensen Huang introduced that technology, the brand new Blackwell computing platform.

""I'm holding around ten billion dollars worth of equipment here,"" said Huang, holding up a prototype of the Blackwell, adding that the next one will cost half that amount, pointing out that it just gets cheaper and more accessible from this point, henceforth.

The nature and economics of technological advancement. Putting a bunch of these chips together will now result in cranking out a level and intensity of computing power that has never been seen before.

The predecessor of Blackwell was called the Hopper. Blackwell is between two and thirty times faster, depending on how you measure it.

To make things clearer, Huang explained that earlier it took 8,000 GPUs, 15 megawatts, and 90 days to create the GPT-MoE-1.8T model, whereas with the new system you could just use 2,000 GPUs and a quarter of the power.

Nvidia also introduced a new set of tools for automakers working on self-driven cars and new tools for roboticists to enhance their robots. Huang's favourite phrase through the address was ""AI factory"".

""There's a new industrial revolution happening in these (server) rooms. I call them AI factories,"" he announced.

Huang also presented NVIDIA NIM, a new way of packaging and delivering software that connects developers with hundreds of millions of GPUs to deploy custom AI of all kinds.

Also, to bring AI into the physical world, Omniverse Cloud APIs were introduced to deliver advanced simulation capabilities.

The star of the tech opera was definitely the Blackwell chip, held up triumphantly by its proud father, Jensen Huang, dwarfing its older sibling, the Hopper, physically and otherwise.

Named after David Harold Blackwell, a University of California, Berkeley mathematician specialising in game theory and statistics and the first Black scholar to be inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, this new microarchitecture has surpassed its antecedent by leaps and bounds.

It delivers 2.5x its predecessor's performance in FP8 for training and each chip, and 5x FP4 if we are theorising. It also features a fifth generation NVLink interconnect that's twice as fast as the Hopper and scaled up to 576 GPUs.

The NVIDIA GB200 Blackwell Superchip connects two Blackwell NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPUs to the NVIDIA Grace CPU over a 900GB/s ultra-low power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.

Huang displayed a board with the system elucidating further: ""This computer is the first of its kind where this much computing fits into this small of a space. Since this is memory coherent, they feel like it's one big happy family working on one application together.""

He went on to elaborate on the amount of energy, time, and networking bandwidth that will be saved, which will transform the world of work and herald a new era.

Generative AI, which is believed to be the future is a type of AI that can create brand new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos and music.

Huang said, ""The future is generative...which is why this is a brand new industry. We've created a processor for the generative AI era.""

For the common man, what all this essentially means is that the Blackwell is about four times faster than any previous AI supercomputing chip, which will inevitably lead to unprecedented, unparalleled advancements in pretty much any industry you can think of, be it robotics, medicine, AI, science, or others, at an insurmountable, never-before-seen speed.

The industry has already embraced Blackwell with open arms and a wide smile. The press release announcing Blackwell includes enthusiastic endorsements from luminaries including Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, CEO Michael Dell, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Open AI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, and the multifaceted celebrity CEO of our times, Elon Musk.

Blackwell is currently being adopted by every prominent global cloud services provider, pioneering AI companies, and server and system vendors around the world.

Our very own homegrown Mumbai-based data centre and on-cloud AI infrastructure provider, Yotta Data Services, headed by Sunil Gupta, who has already received their first batch of GPUs from Nvidia, is looking to raise funds to complete its order, which includes the Blackwell AI training GPU.

The Blackwell is expected to hit Indian shores by October. While tech, telecom, and other industries are already putting Blackwell to use, the greatest impact it will have is on healthcare.

Nvidia is already in imaging systems, in gene sequencing instruments and working with leading surgical robots companies.

It is safe to say 2020s will be the decade of AI and as the day of true artificial generative AI comes closer and closer, it is going to be only the companies who have laid the required groundwork, who will be in a position to keep up to serve all their pillars of digital transformation - people, customers, operations, finance and product innovation.",firstpost.com,news,Firstpost,,0.3176470588235294,448980496,1,"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/03/NVIDIA-launches-new-Blackwell-B200-AI-Chip-claims-30-times-more-power-than-their-current-flagship-H100-2024-03-e7edffbd5963fa626361038a54cbd62b-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",eng-9421402

Perth property prices could increase by a whopping 20 to 30 per cent over the next three years, thanks to a once-in-a-generation ""supercycle"".

That's according to one of WA's leading housing experts, who said the boom, which typically occurs once every 30 years, would be driven by a chronic undersupply of homes.

In a letter addressed to Mayor Sebastian Duterte, the City Administrator's Office, the City Economic Enterprise (CEE) and the City Council's Committee on Government Enterprises and Privatization, Ligaya Uba, president of the Agdao Public Market Dry Goods Section said they are renting stalls at P4,700 to P5,000 a month, but some vendors could only earn 50 pesos a day because of their location.

The Variety or Groceries section is located on the second floor of the market's new building, far from the vegetables section on the ground floor at the other building currently undergoing renovation. Buyers will have to go to the next building to buy vegetables. Because of this, vendors in the groceries section are ""forced to sell vegetables to earn profit.""

""Such acts by the said vendors earned them several notices of violation from the City Economic Enterprise due to violation of market sectioning as provided under Article 11, Section 340 of Ordinance No. 0291-17 or the 2017 Davao City Revenue Code,"" committee chair Councilor Edgar P. Ibuyan Jr. said during the council's session last Friday.

Section 340 states that no vendor should be ""allowed to sell, display, or offer goods or services that are not included... where his or her stall or space belongs.""

Uba told reporters at the sideline of the City Council's session that they hope the Council passes a resolution that would stop the issuance of notices of violation because it ""demoralizes the vendors.""

During the City Council's Committee Report about the vendors' concerns on March 11, CEE Market Supervisor Gerardo Antonio Castillo said they are mandated to issue notices of violations to the vendors.

Castillo cited Article 11, Section 364 of the 2017 Davao City Revenue Code, prohibiting peddlers or hawkers in public markets and their surroundings within a radius of 200 meters where goods are sold or exposed for sale in the stalls or booths.

Vendors are to be fined 200 pesos per violation but after two counts, their stalls will be closed.

Castillo also said the new building of the Agdao Public Market has Fish, Meat, Dry Goods, Variety or Groceries, and Cold Storage Sections; while the old or the neighboring building has Vegetable and Fruit, Rice, Corn and other Cereals, and Food Court/Eatery Sections.

""A resolution asking CEE to temporarily allow the vendors from the Variety or Groceries Section to sell goods under the Vegetable and Fruit Section and vice versa would suffice to address this issue,"" Ibuyan said.

Uba said she hopes the City Council will allow the merger of the sections as soon as possible because the CEE allowed the vendors in the Variety section to sell vegetables only until April 1. Beyond that date, notices of violation will again be issued.

The new Agdao Public Market currently has 157 stalls and 45 open stalls. The P850 million renovation of the market was stopped on its third phase due to lack of funds.""

Castillo said the city is currently looking for additional funds to continue the project. (Ian Carl Espinosa/MindaNews)",mindanews.com,news,MindaNews,,-0.2549019607843137,448980363,1,https://mindanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24market11.jpg,

The program implemented by Wana Energy Solutions (WES) aims to distribute cleaner cooking solutions to at least 1,500 households in the Kisenyi area in Kampala Central. The solutions include a Light Petroleum Gas (LPG) stove, gas cookers, energy-saving stoves, and briquettes, as well as electric pressure cookers, among other solutions, which the promoters say are targeted and convenient for the communities in those areas.

Emmy Wasira, the Founder and Chief Executive of WES Energy says they first understood what the majority of the people in the area earn and how much they spend on cooking before coming up with the model. He says that Under the hire purchase plan where one pays 1,600 shillings, it becomes cheaper because under the usual energy they use, mainly charcoal, they spend more than that.

Wasira says they realized that most of the communities in the target area could not afford to purchase a unit at once because of the kind of income they have, yet they were spending a lot in daily fuel supplies. In 2017, the same company in conjunction with the Uganda National Alliance on Clean Cooking pioneered a pay-as-you-go solution, which provided a metering gas cooking solution.

But Wasira says this has been convenient for smaller households and was not popular among the bigger families, hence the decision to come up with the new project that is both affordable and convenient to the majority of families in the slummy area.

He said that apart from the convenient payment methods, they have door-to-door delivery services to make access easy, as well as free refilling when the cylinder runs out of gas. Last year, the government launched a program to demonstrate and promote clean energy solutions, especially LPG gas, and it has been implemented in the Grater Kampala areas.

Brian Isabirye, the Commissioner Renewable Energy Department in the Ministry said this new project is part of the efforts to ensure a more sustainable solution is added so that more people are included. While commissioning the project, Commissioner Isabirye said this pilot project would inform the ministry and the partners on whether to expand it to other parts of Kampala and later to the rest of the country.

The project is also part of a partnership dubbed Enabling African Cities for Transformative Energy Access (ENACT), funded by donors like Transforming Energy Access by USAID, Energy for Impact, and Local Governments for Sustainability.

The ENACT project is creating an enabling environment for the provision of adequate, safe, reliable, clean, and affordable access to energy and clean cooking in informal settlements, targeting over 2000 households and 600 micro-enterprises in Kampala, and the Sierra Leone capital, Free Town.

Isabirye hopes that these initiatives will turn around energy use in Uganda and that as more people afford renewable energy, it will in the end contribute to the protection of the environment by reducing the number of trees being cut for charcoal.",independent.co.ug,news,The Independent Uganda:,,0.3803921568627451,448980321,1,https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Commissioner-Isabirye-launching-the-new-hire-purchase-renewable-energy-program...jpg,

Chairman of Boubyan Bank, Mr. Abdulaziz Abdullah Dakheel Al-Shaya, stated: ""Boubyan Bank has successfully concluded its 5-year strategy 'Boubyan 2023', launched in 2019 that aimed at complete and positive transformation of its business operations. The bank has reaped the fruit of this strategy through accelerated growth across its financial indicators and market shares, the thing which reflects the robustness of the bank's financial position, the sustainability of its profits, and reinforces the bank's position as one of the major financial institutions regionally, and the third largest bank in terms of financing portfolio and total assets in the Kuwaiti market.""

This statement came during the general assembly meeting of Boubyan Bank for the financial year ended December 31st 2023, with an attendance exceeding 82%. He emphasized: ""With the conclusion of 2023, Boubyan Bank managed to have a record growth rate of 39%, while registering KD 80.4 million in net profits with an earnings per share of 18.8 fils, and the bank continued its precautionary approach by allocating KD 31.7 million in provisions. All this was the fruit of the bank's successful strategy 'towards perfection'.""

Mr. Al-Shaya pointed out that all of the bank's key indicators witnessed a remarkable growth in 2023, where the total combined assets of Boubyan Bank Group increased to KD 8.4 billion at a growth rate of 7%. Moreover, the total of customers' deposits grew by 9% to reach KD 6.5 billion, while the financing portfolio grew by 7% to reach KD 6.3 billion, and operating income grew by 8% to reach KD 218 million.

""What makes the results of Boubyan more significant are the core business and profitability practices of the Group, which were significantly reinforced by the bank in 2023 compared with the last financial year, while improving the NPL ratio, making it one of the lowest locally."", he elaborated.

Al-Shaya went on to add: ""Boubyan's strategy was successfully concluded with continued growth in terms of total assets and deposits, maintaining its position as the bank with the third largest financing portfolio and total assets in the Kuwaiti market, while continuing to achieve double digit profitability growth rates.""

Mr. Al-Shaya sincerely thanked the shareholders, investors, and all Boubyan's customers for their confidence and loyalty to the bank, and reiterated the Board's full and ongoing support to the efforts of the bank's highly-professional executive management, which wisely steers the bank towards achieving the best results, while thanking all the bank's employees for their dedication throughout the past year.

Approval of Profit Distribution

During the general assembly meeting, it was approved to distribute 8% in cash dividends and 6% in bonus shares to eligible shareholders who are registered with the bank's registers as at the end of the maturity date of April 24th 2024, and to allocate the same to shareholders on April 25th 2024. The Board of Directors has been authorized to dispose of the share fractions and amend this schedule in case the confirmation thereof is not announced at least eight business days ahead of the maturity date as stipulated and in line with the provisions of the Law.

Furthermore, the Ordinary General Assembly approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors to distribute dividends to shareholders at the end of the financial year or semi-annually, and authorized the Board to execute the decision of the General Assembly as per the percentages decided by the Board.

A Year of Leadership and Solid Performance

On his part, Boubyan Bank's Vice-Chairman & Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Adel Abdul Wahab Al-Majed, stated: ""Thanks to Almighty Allah, the past year witnessed the achievement of goals, milestones, and expansions, regionally and internationally, thanks to the solid pillars upon which the Group's vision and strategy are based. Hence, the bank managed to make its mark in the Islamic banking industry and to make a franchise that stands out from the competition, be they Islamic or conventional banks.""

""During Boubyan's journey, the bank managed - through well-studied steps - to become a leading franchise despite the fierce competition among the banking sector's institutions, thus following a tailored path that reinforces customer satisfaction levels, leading to receiving a 96% customer-satisfaction score among all Islamic and conventional local banks. The bank's market share and its ongoing growth reflect the high levels in customer service and digital excellence, which are the fruit of the bank's clear strategy, professional executive team, and continued investment in our human resources with special focus on our national cadres"", he added.

He elaborated: ""Our sustainable growth was the result of a well-studied approach towards investing in various business sectors, thus leading to significant growth in our consumer banking and corporate banking businesses, thanks to our focus on creativity and innovation, despite the fierce competition in the banking sector.""

Plans and Goals

Al-Majed reiterated: ""The bank will follow its unique strategic approach to maintain solid profitability and ongoing growth, based on its sound management and status, which qualifies it to benefit from its strong potentials and solid financial position to help customers benefit from growth opportunities in our favorite markets.""

""As a part of Boubyan's vision and in line with the new brand identity refreshed in 2023, entitled 'Imagine the possibilities', we reiterate our commitment to supporting the state's development plans through financing projects, for corporates or retail customers, taking into consideration green financing. We are also targeting further regional and international expansion, as well as keeping up with the latest developments in the field of digital banking solutions and Islamic investments to better serve customers and the society."", he pointed out.

Governance

Al-Majed stated: ""Governance is one of the pillars of the credit decision and giving an advantage to customers who have sound governance practices in place. Accordingly, Boubyan has been keen on applying the instructions and guidelines of CBK in that regard. This has been taken into consideration as well upon designing the banking applications which include a number of authorities for various management levels at companies, in addition to providing the possibility of internal monitoring by the company over the performed transactions in order to ensure the uninterrupted provision of secure and cutting-edge banking services.""

""The concept of digital transformation in banking institutions has become associated to a great extent with the name of Boubyan, as the phrase 'for the first time in Kuwait' has been mostly synonymous with Boubyan Bank's innovative services and solutions in Islamic digital banking."", Al-Majed added.

He went on to highlight: ""Boubyan Bank's digital transformation strategy gained a significant momentum, being a real example for succeeding in being highly competitive regionally in digital services, and in changing the lives of our customers through our services and products. Our digital services' journey is very exceptional. It has seen us excel and climb to the top of the pyramid amid tough competition in the market for digital banking services which is growing rapidly.""

Al-Majed went on to add: ""Boubyan offers a group of innovative services, products, and digital solutions through its retail and corporate Apps. Such offerings add value to customers and show the bank's keenness to maintain its leadership in innovation to ensure supporting its customers, enriching their banking experience, and making things easier, especially amid the competition across various business sectors. This reflects the bank's ongoing approach to develop the digital infrastructure and to offer the best services in the field of digital payments.""

In 2023, Boubyan inaugurated a number of new branches, bringing the number to 47 branches across Kuwait, which were fully upgraded and modernized as per the latest international systems and standards. The branches were well-manned with competent banking professionals along with all resources that guarantee customers enjoy a swift, convenient, smooth, and unique banking experience that keeps pace with the developments of banking services.

Awards and International Ratings

Al-Majed added: ""In 2023, Boubyan received more than 20 awards, recognitions, and international ratings from renowned global institutions across various domains and business sectors such as digital transformation, corporate banking, customer service, and customer satisfaction, which reinforced our banking leadership and emphasized the strength of the strategy the bank has been adopting since many years locally, regionally, and internationally.""

Furthermore, our ratings from Moody's, S&P, and Fitch remain stable at A2, A, and A respectively. As for the ex-government support (or xgs) rating assigned by Fitch, the introduction of such new criteria communicates Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of Boubyan excluding assumptions of extraordinary government support. Boubyan was assigned the second highest rating in Kuwait as per such criteria.

Nomo Bank .. International Expansion

In 2023, Nomo Bank, the digital bank of the Bank of London and the Middle East ""BLME"", a subsidiary of Boubyan Bank Group, launched unique products and services that put it on par with top financial institutions, whereby it aspires to become the Islamic bank of choice for GCC customers in the United Kingdom.

Moreover, Nomo continues to make its mark in the Islamic digital banking sector through the recent launch of many products such as the multicurrency account, which allows customers to perform their banking transactions in six different currencies, enabling them to make payments in local currencies in more than 25 countries spanned across Europe and the Middle East within seconds using Nomo App, in addition to immediately benefiting from remittance and fund-transfer services, coupled with the possibility of automatically linking the account with Nomo Card and Apple Pay.

Nomo managed to position itself as one of the best Sharia-compliant property finance options in the United Kingdom, as it offers a group of integrated real estate, finance, and advisory services related to ownership of real estate properties in the UK market to its customers in Kuwait and the region, through partnerships with major real estate companies such as Ayan Real Estate, Blueprint, and Great Portland. Additionally, Nomo inked significant agreements such as the partnership with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank ""ADCB"" and Al Hilal Digital Bank to give citizens and residents of the U.A.E. an opportunity to benefit from the innovative services and solutions by Nomo Bank through ADCB - Nomo and Al Hilal Nomo Apps.

Corporate Banking

Mr. Al-Majed further reiterated: ""In 2023, the Corporate Banking Group managed to make a significant milestone by diversifying and improving a number of products and services, and it is expected to begin to reap the reward of that as of 2024.

This targeted all companies across various sectors in Kuwait, in an attempt to offer innovative and edge-cutting banking services, being the traditional concept limited to financing transactions, thus not only making it as a one-stop shop for all corporate banking needs, but also extending to provide services to customers and corporate vendors. Accordingly, this made the bank more inclined towards focusing on innovation in products and services, in addition to upgrading the bank's processes.""

Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Resources

Boubyan succeeded to stand out as an excellent role model in CSR and in the support of sustainability through many events and initiatives that made a clear mark and emphasized the bank's social excellence, as well as its ongoing plans, which were crowned with the ""World's Best Islamic Bank for CSR"" by Global Finance in recognition of the bank's prominent CSR role in supporting various segments of the society, which confirms that the bank is on the right track to reinforce sustainable development inside and outside Kuwait.

During the past year, the bank's human resources proved themselves to be one of the key pillars of its continued success, as they embrace and adopt Boubyan's future vision, the thing which comes in line with the principle of diverse job roles at the workplace, which greatly contributes to the introduction of innovative and creative ideas and deliverables, which significantly increase the bank's productivity and profitability.

Boubyan is always looking forward to developing strategies that accelerate the empowerment of female employees, while confirming the bank's commitment to providing all that is necessary to support women's leadership role, and to foster this social culture in a real and sustainable manner, to have a positive effect on the future job market and achieve the desired results.

As a result, the bank managed to reach the highest percentage of national manpower across the private sector, which now exceeds 81%, while effectively taking many decisions that largely contributed to an increased number of women in leadership positions, along with the overall increase of female cadres at the bank who now account for ~30%.

Thanks & Appreciations

Al-Shaya concluded his word during the general assembly meeting: ""For myself and on behalf all the team of Boubyan Bank, I would like to express deepest thanks and appreciation to His Highness, the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, may Allah protect him, and H.H. Sheikh Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, the

Prime Minister, for all their efforts towards the development and growth of our dear country, and to guarantee the stability and security of everyone who considers this blessed land home.""

He added: ""I would also like to express the deepest thanks to all the executives of the Central Bank of Kuwait, headed by H.E., the Governor, Mr. Basel Al-Haroon, who spared no effort to take the actions deemed appropriate to develop and safeguard the Kuwaiti banking system. I would also like to express deepest thanks to all the bank's esteemed shareholders and customers who have always been the key factor behind our success by supporting us in overcoming our challenges.

Moreover, I would like to thank all members of the Sharia Supervisory Board at the bank for their great efforts, and I would like to thank members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management, as well as all the bank's employees for their cooperation, commitment, and keenness on supporting the bank for the benefit of the bank and its shareholders.""",zawya.com,news,Zawya.com,,0.6000000000000001,448980314,1,https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/NDQ5YzEzMzAtY2M0Ny00/0/1dfg-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2,

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) share price has soared 271% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Meanwhile the share price is 1.3% higher than it was a week ago.

Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.

View our latest analysis for Amkor Technology

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During five years of share price growth, Amkor Technology achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 30% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Amkor Technology's earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Amkor Technology's TSR for the last 5 years was 283%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective

Amkor Technology shareholders gained a total return of 25% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 31% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that Amkor Technology is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...

Aliko Dangote has begun the distribution of one million bags of rice worth N5 billion nationwide to support the federal government's palliative programme.

Dangote reportedly began the distribution of one million bags of rice to Nigerians as part of his company's intervention to address the growing economic hardships Nigerians are grappling with.

The Dangote Group began distributing in Kano and Lagos on Saturday, March 23, 2024. It declared that the one million bags of 10kg rice cost the Dangote Group about N5 billion to secure for distribution to Nigerians.

BusinessDay reports that the group said about 120,000 bags of rice are to be distributed to Nigerians in Lagos and Kano states each, with both states getting 240,000 bags out of the one million bags.

Dangote noted that the remaining 860,000 bags were slated for distribution in the remaining 34 states in Nigeria to align with the company's core value of compassion for the less privileged Nigerians.

Dangote said that the rice distribution is a follow-up to the firm's other humanitarian support of feeding more than 10,000 people daily in Kano and its ongoing Ramadan Feeding Programme across the state.

Legit.ng reported that the Nigerian government has purchased about 58,500 tons of milled rice from the Rice Farmers Association to stabilise the market nationwide.

The competition celebrates entrepreneurial spirit in three categories: early start-up, mid-sized start-up, and scale-ups. Entrants pitch and promote their business idea, technology innovation, or research application to the distinguished panel of judges, including experts in branding; brand valuation; business advisory services; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors; finance; IP law; and marketing.

Participating business owners and entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to network with other start-ups, scale-ups, and entrepreneurs and to gain invaluable insights from experts and peers.

INTA fosters innovation in accessible ways, to welcome the new generation of creators and entrepreneurs into the Association's global network of brand owners and professionals and to help them protect their IP and grow their brands.

Allan Jarry, Managing Partner at JarryIP (Chile) and Stefanie Schodrof, Head of Business Development U.S. at Gevers (USA) have joined the panel of judges. Additional judges will be announced at a later date.

""Our involvement in INTA's Open Innovation Challenge enhanced our comprehension of intellectual property. As a medical device start-up, this intellectual property is an integral part of our company,"" said Aaron Glick, CEO of Ember Sleep (USA) upon winning the IOC last year in the mid-stage start-up category. ""This experience offered a platform for us to learn from industry experts and fellow innovators, enhancing our position for long-term success in a dynamic landscape by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of intellectual property rights.""

New this year is the option to participate in the OIC virtually. While appearing in person will extend participants' ability to connect with peers and experts, the Competition has expanded its accessibility to those unable to travel to Atlanta for the Annual Meeting. The OIC welcomes applications from all industries and invites innovators from all over the world to participate. Applicants must submit all application materials by April 19, 2024.

The Shortlisted Finalists' Pitch Presentation will take place on Sunday, May 19, both in person and virtually. The winner will be announced later that day as part of the Annual Meeting Opening Ceremonies.

INTA's Annual Meeting is the largest gathering of IP professionals in the world. More than 10,000 brand owners and professionals, business leaders, academics, and government officials are expected to attend this year's Meeting.

""INTA prides itself on engaging with the world in ways that showcase the power of IP to fuel innovation and creative problem-solving,"" said INTA CEO Etienne Sanz de Acedo. ""We are proud to throw open the doors for the third Challenge and I, for one, look forward to learning what the next big idea is going to be!""",agip-news.com,news,AGIP,,0.6705882352941177,448980184,1,,

MUNICH - Companies and inventors filed 199 275 patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) last year, an increase of 2.9% on the previous year and the highest number to date, according to the EPO's Patent Index 2023 published March 19. This follows growth of 2.6% in 2022 and 4.7% in 2021. Patent applications, which are filed to help protect and market inventions, are an early indicator of companies' R&D investments, a press release stated by EPO.

""Our latest Patent Index shows that innovation remained vibrant around the world in 2023,"" said EPO President António Campinos. ""The EPO was entrusted with examining more applications than ever before, attesting to both the attractiveness of the European technology market and the high quality of our products and services. Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are making ever-increasing use of patents, with the share of applications from SMEs at its highest level yet last year. These businesses can also now benefit from the new Unitary Patent, which significantly improves the environment for innovation in Europe, providing a simpler and more cost-effective option for innovators to protect their inventions and bring them to the vast EU market.""

Boom in inventions in digital communication and energy technologies

The leading technical fields for patent applications at the EPO last year were digital communication (which covers technologies related to mobile networks), medical technology and computer technology. The strongest growth among all technology fields in 2023, however, was in electrical machinery, apparatus, energy (+12.2% over 2022), which covers inventions related to clean-energy technologies, including batteries (+28%). Patent activity in biotechnology (+5.9%) also continued to rise further.

Global and European trends

The top five countries of origin for European patent applications in 2023 were the United States, Germany, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea. Some 43% of the total applications came from companies and inventors from the EPO's 39 member states, while 57% originated from outside Europe.

The number of patent applications originating from the EPO's 39 member states increased again in 2023 (85,748 applications, +1.8%). European companies posted above average growth in the fields of digital communication (+10.7%), biotechnology (+6.4%), computer technology (+4.2%) and measurement (+4.0%).

Finland, Spain, UK and Italy with strongest growth in Europe

Patent applications from companies and inventors in Germany, Europe's leading country of origin, were back to growth (+1.4%) last year compared to 2022, while French firms filed slightly fewer applications (-1.5%). Patent filings from most other European countries were up. Among the larger patent filing countries (with over 5,000 applications), the highest growth came from the UK (+4.2%), Italy (+3.8%), the Netherlands (+3.5%), Switzerland (+2.7%) and Sweden (+2.0%). Even stronger increases (among European countries with over 1,000 applications) were posted by Finland (+9.2%) and Spain (+6.9%). In terms of patent applications per capita, Switzerland again led the rankings, followed by several Nordic countries.

More inventions from China and Republic of Korea

The overall growth in patent applications at the EPO in 2023 was mainly fuelled by steep increases from the Republic of Korea (+21.0%) and the People's Republic of China (+8.8% compared with 2022). The Republic of Korea entered the top five for the first time, while patent applications from China have more than doubled since 2018.

Other countries that showed significant growth in patent filings at the EPO last year, albeit from smaller volumes, include Canada (+2.6%), Brazil (+4.1%), Chinese Taipei (+5.9%), India (+8.4%) and Singapore (+22.3%).

Huawei tops applicant ranking

Huawei was again the leading applicant at the EPO in 2023 - increasing its applications significantly to over 5 000 and accounting for almost a quarter of all filings to the EPO from China. Samsung and LG were ranked No. 2 and 3, and together made up two-thirds of all European patent applications originating from the Republic of Korea. Qualcomm and Ericsson rounded out the top five. The top ten includes four companies from Europe, two from the Republic of Korea, two from the US and one from each of China and Japan.

Nearly every fourth application from Europe filed by a small company

But patents are also very important for small businesses: In 2023, 23% of patent applications to the EPO originating in Europe was filed by an individual inventor or a small or medium-sized enterprise (with fewer than 250 employees). A further 8% came from universities and public research organizations (see graph Breakdown of applicants by category). As part of its ongoing support for smaller entities, the EPO has announced new fee reductions as of April 1, 2024 for micro-enterprises, individuals, non-profits, universities and public research organizations.

Spotlight on women inventors

This year's Patent Index also looks at the contribution of women to innovation. For all patent applications filed with the EPO last year coming from Europe, 27% named at least one woman as an inventor. Among the larger European patent filing countries (with more than 2,000 applications per year), Spain (46%), France (33%) and Belgium (32%) had the highest share of patent applications naming at least one woman as inventor in 2023. In terms of technology sectors, the proportion ranged from 14% on average for patent applications in mechanical engineering to 50% in chemistry. This data can help in addressing the gaps that remain to be bridged to harness the full potential of women inventors.

Solid uptake of new Unitary Patent

Since June 1, 2023, innovators can also benefit from the Unitary Patent system - a new way to enjoy simpler and cheaper patent protection in 17 EU member states, in which a European patent has unitary legal effect and can be enforced or litigated before the new Unified Patent Court. The new system has already proven popular with patent owners: unitary protection was requested for 17.5% of all European patents granted in 2023 (more than 18,300 requests filed) and for 22.3% of those granted in the second half of 2023 after the system was launched. Patentees from Europe (39 EPO member states) had the highest uptake rate at 25.8%, followed by those from the US and China (both 10.9%), Republic of Korea (9.7%) and Japan (4.9%). The top Unitary Patent requestors in 2023 were Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Qualcomm, Samsung and Ericsson. Of the patentees who have transformed their European patents into Unitary Patents, some two-thirds are European.",agip-news.com,news,AGIP,,0.5294117647058822,448980178,1,,

It was a can­did state­ment from ANSA McAL's chief le­gal and ex­ter­nal af­fairs of­fi­cer, Frances Bain-Cum­ber­batch as she re­flect­ed on the con­glom­er­ate's Eu­rochamTT's award on March 15.

ANSA McAL was pre­sent­ed with the over­all Sus­tain­abil­i­ty Cham­pi­on 2024 large com­pa­nies award by the Eu­ro­pean Busi­ness Cham­ber in T&T (Eu­rochamTT) which held its sec­ond edi­tion of such recog­ni­tion.

Mean­while, RESS­COTT Ltd took home the Eu­rochamTT/ UN Sus­tain­abil­i­ty Cham­pi­on 2024 in the small and medi­um-sized en­ter­pris­es.

The over­all sus­tain­abil­i­ty award is a crown­ing mo­ment fol­low­ing sev­er­al years of hard work from the likes of Bain-Cum­ber­batch, cor­po­rate sus­tain­abil­i­ty spe­cial­ist Na­tal­ie Bib­by, and the head of cul­ture and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at ANSA McAL, Sarah In­gle­field.

Bib­by said among the ma­jor sus­tain­abil­i­ty ini­tia­tives emerg­ing across the group is Carib re­cap­tur­ing car­bon diox­ide to reuse in its op­er­a­tion while al­so us­ing less wa­ter.

The bev­er­age com­pa­ny has been do­ing so since 2002 and re­cap­tured 423 thou­sand kilo­grammes in 2023 and 485 thou­sand kilo­grammes in 2022.

The same process takes place at the fac­to­ry in St Kitts and Nevis where 73 thou­sand kilo­grammes of car­bon were re­cap­tured last year.

She added that in Ju­ly 2022, ANSA Mer­chant Bank and ANSA Bank part­nered with The Crop­per Foun­da­tion to launch the Na­tion­al Cap­i­tal Hub while Berg­er Bar­ba­dos runs on 30 per cent so­lar en­er­gy and Sis­sons Grena­da re­cent­ly in­stalled so­lar light­ing in its car park.

""Each of the sec­tors has En­vi­ron­men­tal, So­cial and Gov­er­nance (ESG) Key Per­for­mance In­di­ca­tors (KPIs) that have been set since 2022 and there are pro­gress­ing ef­forts to push those plans for­ward every year,"" Bib­by ex­plained.

Bain-Cum­ber­batch was quick to note that ANSA McAL's thrust to­ward sus­tain­abil­i­ty did not start four years ago.

In­stead, she not­ed, ""Carib Glass­works is the on­ly re­cy­cling com­pa­ny there is in terms of re­cy­cling glass. They've been do­ing that for the last 60 years.

""The Carib brew­ery mod­el is a re­turn­able bot­tle mod­el - the on­ly suc­cess­ful re­turn­able glass bot­tle mod­el in the coun­try so sus­tain­abil­i­ty on an en­vi­ron­men­tal ba­sis has been at the root of many things.""

Bain-Cum­ber­batch said what they have done since 2020 is for­malise and be­gin em­bed­ding that in­to the op­er­a­tions of the group, ""so to see our work be­ing recog­nised like this is a phe­nom­e­nal feel­ing.""

Be­yond the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact, an­oth­er key as­pect that arose was the well-be­ing of the em­ploy­ees.

Some of the com­pa­nies with­in the ANSA McAL group have be­gun ini­ti­at­ing ""well­ness spaces"" in their day-to-day op­er­a­tions where em­ploy­ees can take a time­out if they need to.

Mean­while, the ANSA con­struc­tion sec­tor has cre­at­ed a lac­ta­tion room for women to cater to new moms or soon-to-be new moms. In­gle­field said, ""Well-be­ing and look­ing af­ter our peo­ple are very im­por­tant as­pects of our sus­tain­able busi­ness prac­tices out­side of the great things be­ing done in the op­er­a­tions them­selves.""

She said the award gives them a great deal of con­fi­dence that they are on the right track.

""It is one thing for us to do it which is bril­liant, but it's im­por­tant we com­mu­ni­cate to our em­ploy­ees and our wider com­mu­ni­ty like busi­ness part­ners, gov­ern­ment, stake­hold­ers, col­leagues and com­peti­tors in the in­dus­try what we are do­ing and why it's im­por­tant and how it is im­pact­ing on our peo­ple and our plan­et and that's an in­cred­i­bly im­por­tant part of this,"" she added.

In­gle­field said she aims to ul­ti­mate­ly have each ANSA McAL em­ploy­ee across each of the sev­en ter­ri­to­ries be the cham­pi­on of sus­tain­abil­i­ty.

Bain-Cum­ber­batch went fur­ther adding, ""Sus­tain­abil­i­ty is good for busi­ness.""

She said she hopes the award in­spires oth­er com­pa­nies to see the im­por­tance of sus­tain­abil­i­ty, not just be­cause it is the right thing to do but be­cause it can help their busi­ness.

""If you op­er­ate more ef­fi­cient­ly, you use less wa­ter and you use less en­er­gy, you save while pre­serv­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. You cre­ate bet­ter ef­fi­cien­cies by op­er­at­ing more sus­tain­ably. That, in and of it­self should en­cour­age busi­ness­es and if they see a com­pa­ny such as ANSA McAL ac­tu­al­ly throw­ing it­self 100 per cent, if we set an ex­am­ple as one of the old­est and largest con­glom­er­ates in the re­gion and we have cho­sen to go this route to en­sure we con­tin­ue to sur­vive and to thrive then it should be an au­to­mat­ic ex­am­ple,"" she added.

At an in­di­vid­ual lev­el, In­gle­field chal­lenged peo­ple to think about one small step they can take in their home life or busi­ness-and adopt it and feel the change in how they are adding to the mo­men­tum of sus­tain­abil­i­ty across the coun­try.

Eu­ro­pean Busi­ness Cham­ber push­ing sus­tain­abil­i­ty

The Eu­ro­pean Busi­ness Cham­ber in T&T has al­so been push­ing the sus­tain­abil­i­ty move­ment on both sides of the At­lantic.

The cham­ber was es­tab­lished to sup­port Eu­ro­pean busi­ness in­ter­ests in T&T while sup­port­ing lo­cal com­pa­nies that want to ex­port, part­ner, or do busi­ness with Eu­rope.

Ac­cord­ing to the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the cham­ber, Marie Louise Nor­ton-Mur­ray, one of the main pil­lars is trade sup­port.

""Sup­port­ing lo­cal com­pa­nies to do busi­ness in Eu­rope is not an easy task,"" she said.

Out­lin­ing some of those chal­lenges, Nor­ton-Mur­ray ex­plained, ""One of the first ar­eas is meet­ing food safe­ty stan­dards and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion and not just food safe­ty, it could be oth­er qual­i­ty stan­dards. We now have sus­tain­abil­i­ty stan­dards, and some of these are not just vol­un­tary stan­dards, some of them are manda­to­ry. That is the first sup­port that com­pa­nies need - to meet the stan­dards and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion.""

She not­ed the stan­dards and reg­u­la­tions are not bad for busi­ness be­cause con­sumers are con­cerned about their health and safe­ty.

Nor­ton-Mur­ray fur­ther ex­plained some of the chal­lenges fac­ing lo­cal com­pa­nies in­clude la­belling as well as qual­i­ty pack­ag­ing.

""Con­sumers are con­cerned about sus­tain­abil­i­ty so they are con­cerned about pack­ag­ing that is re­cy­clable,"" which she iden­ti­fied are among some of the things that are chang­ing the face of the Eu­ro­pean mar­ket when it comes to im­por­ta­tion.

This is where the Eu­ro­pean Cham­ber is hop­ing to as­sist lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers and dis­trib­u­tors.

""We see our role as be­ing able to in­form peo­ple of the chang­ing reg­u­la­to­ry en­vi­ron­ment like when you have a new reg­u­la­tion such as Car­bon Bor­der Ad­just­ment Mech­a­nism (CBAM) or an­ti-de­for­esta­tion reg­u­la­tion or sus­tain­abil­i­ty reg­u­la­tions such as the cor­po­rate due dili­gence, so one role we play is in­for­ma­tion. We have ac­cess to the in­for­ma­tion and tools which we could share with peo­ple to get in­to the Eu­ro­pean mar­ket,"" she said.

Eu­rope is al­ready a ma­jor des­ti­na­tion for T&T goods.

Co­coa and choco­late-re­lat­ed prod­ucts are ma­jor ex­ports from this coun­try.

Less­er known prod­ucts in­clude agro-processed ex­ot­ic food sources, co­conut-based sources, and fruit-based prod­ucts.

""All of these prod­ucts have po­ten­tial es­pe­cial­ly if they are us­ing lo­cal raw ma­te­ri­als or raw ma­te­ri­als from the re­gion and they are dif­fer­ent and can meet the food safe­ty re­quire­ments,"" Nor­ton-Mur­ray added.

Agri­cul­ture is one of the sec­tors that has be­come a ma­jor point of con­ver­sa­tion be­tween both par­ties.

A pro­gramme called Com­mit­tee Link­ing En­tre­pre­neur­ship-Agri­cul­ture-De­vel­op­ment (COLEAD) pro­vides a se­ries of train­ing pro­grammes and a plat­form for train­ing where farm­ers do not have to phys­i­cal­ly at­tend a course but can com­plete the train­ing on­line.

They can al­so net­work with oth­er farm­ers in places like Africa and the Pa­cif­ic.

Nor­ton-Mur­ray al­so high­light­ed the shap­ing of the fu­ture of in­no­va­tion project which is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Eu­ro­pean Union in T&T, the In­ter­Amer­i­can De­vel­op­ment Bank, the Caribbean In­dus­tri­al Re­search In­sti­tute, and the Min­istry of Plan­ning and De­vel­op­ment.

The project helps com­pa­nies with their in­no­v­a­tive go-to-mar­ket strate­gies.

Nor­ton-Mur­ray added some com­pa­nies are get­ting help un­der that project with bet­ter pack­ag­ing, mar­ket­ing strate­gies and at­tend­ing trade shows to ex­port to Eu­rope.

How­ev­er, ex­port­ing to Eu­rope is set to be­come more dif­fi­cult with the im­ple­men­ta­tion of its CBAM.

CBAM will tax car­bon-in­ten­sive prod­ucts that are be­ing im­port­ed in­to the EU.

On a list of coun­tries to be af­fect­ed out­side Eu­rope, T&T will be af­fect­ed the most af­ter Mozam­bique.

This coun­try ex­ports car­bon-in­ten­sive prod­ucts in­clud­ing am­mo­nia and fer­tilis­ers to Eu­rope.

Nor­ton-Mur­ray said the Eu­ro­pean Cham­ber has been sen­si­tis­ing lo­cal busi­ness­es on CBAM.

They have al­so pro­vid­ed tools that can cal­cu­late car­bon bor­der tax­es.

While T&T and Eu­rope have had a long his­to­ry of trade re­la­tions, many with­in the Eu­ro­pean sphere don't want lo­cal com­pa­nies to see CBAM as an ob­sta­cle to do­ing busi­ness across the At­lantic, but rather as a rev­o­lu­tion of the long-stand­ing re­la­tions.

Experts suggest that these holders, driven by a desire for quick profits, do not keep their tokens for a long period. However, if the Bitcoin price corrects as it did in the past week, short-term holders could quickly lose ground. Nevertheless, their behaviors and tokens are very important for the sustainability of a healthy bull market.

ContentsBehavior of Short-Term Bitcoin InvestorsExpert Views on Bitcoin Behavior of Short-Term Bitcoin Investors

Observing the behavior of short-term Bitcoin holders is significant due to historical correlations with the BTC price. The STH category may include addresses that hold their BTC for less than 155 days. After surpassing this limit, addresses can transition to long-term hodlers (LTH). They tend to hold their tokens for the long term and are not inclined to sell based on emotion. The increase in the percentage of BTC supply held by STHs is inversely proportional to the percentage held by LTHs. The graph of the long-term supply held by LTH is also inversely proportional to the Bitcoin price. This can be particularly noticeable at the peak points of consecutive cycles.

Experts believe that the more Bitcoin is sold by long-term holders, the higher the BTC price will be. Therefore, the supply held by STHs is usually directly proportional to the BTC price. Experts continue to believe that the cryptocurrency will keep rising since it has already started to do so. This situation could fuel a growing community of new investors and analysts still eager to join the momentum of the bull market.

Expert Views on Bitcoin

Therefore, the importance of tracking what short-term holders are doing on-chain becomes evident. A recent report by the analyst firm CryptoQuant, highlighted that approximately 50% of Bitcoin's realized capital is held by short-term holders. This indicator particularly shows a significant increase in the excitement and speed of STH purchases over the last 30 days. The analyst then suggests that if Bitcoin's ongoing correction leads back to the STH price area, Bitcoin could reach the $55,000 area. Measured against the current all-time high of $73,777 (ATH), this could be an approximate 25% drop.

He branded the policy as ""super racist"" for setting a 7% limit on employment-based green cards for each country. The law, which was instituted in the 1960s, has remained unaltered since its creation.

Notably, Musk's comments come as Indian-American organizations like the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora (FIIDS) have demanded the elimination of the per-country quota on green cards. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Congressman Matt Cartwright also echoed this demand, emphasizing the importance of immigrants in the US and saying that the country ""depends on high-quality, highly skilled, and smart labor."" ""It's one of the natural advantages of the United States that we welcome people from all over the world,"" he said.

Country-specific caps have predominantly impacted many immigrants from Asian countries, especially India and China. It also resulted in significant backlogs of applicants. According to reports, over one million people are currently in limbo in different states of America due to employment-based green card backlogs. The group includes dependent spouses and children. They are the ones most affected by this policy.

Musk's condemnation of the policy came in response to an X post that said, ""Every month DoS [US Department of State] shamelessly publishes cut-off dates that separate Chinese and Indian born from Rest of the World.""

Discontentment seems to be increasing by the day in sections of the BJP and the TMC in West Bengal with several leaders of both camps expressing displeasure over the selection of candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection.

At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets.

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla.

Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

This long-term capacity remains weaker than ever.

A reminder of these grim odds is the recent release of investment researcher Morningstar's latest U.S. asset/liability barometer, updated to reflect performance in 2023. Last year, 47% of equity mutual funds variable and actively managed exchange-traded funds beat their benchmarks - a marked increase from the minimum rate of return of 43% in 2022. Morningstar calls the increase a ""surge.""

Yet active managers have not become better at beating the market over the long term, as Morningstar acknowledges. Although the percentage of funds that beat the market varies significantly from year to year, the proportion of funds that beat the market over 10- or 20-year periods remains small.

To show that there is no long-term trend, I turned to my auditing firm's database of several hundred investment newsletter histories. For each calendar year since 1981, I have calculated the percentage of monitored newsletters that beat the Wilshire 5,000 Total Market Index XX:W5000FLT. There is no statistically significant trend in these annual percentages, which have fluctuated between 80% and 5%.

No matter how large that proportion was in any given year, the percentage of that year's cohort beating the market eventually fell below 20% (or even below) as the period on which their returns were calculated was long. To illustrate this, consider the newsletters my firm followed in 1982. More than 70% of that cohort beat the Wilshire 5,000 that year, far higher than the 47% success rate in 2023 among mutual funds in investment and ETFs.

Yet in the five years from 1982 to 1986, only 24 percent of the 1982 newsletter cohort beat the market. By the time the performance window extended to 15 years - from January 1982 to December 1996 - the percentage of that 1982 cohort beating the market had fallen to 14%.

Even this already low percentage gives too rosy a picture. Indeed, many of the bulletins published in 1982 did not survive until 1996. Twenty-nine percent of the 1982 group did not survive the full 15 years, and virtually all were late to the market at the time. where they stopped publishing. . Accounting for this survivorship bias, less than 10% of the 1982 newsletter cohort beat the market in the 15 years through 1996.

This 1982 newsletter cohort is not unique. I chose it because it illustrates the inexorable deterioration of the market's outperformance percentage as we focus on a longer and longer period of performance.

It's no surprise that a similar trend exists among mutual funds and ETFs. Morningstar calculated how many funds and ETFs in 2023 were able to beat their benchmarks over increasingly longer periods; these results are summarized in the table above. Over a 20-year performance horizon, the success rate is as low as 5%.

The implication of investing, as is often the case, is to invest the majority of your portfolio in index funds. Investing in an actively managed mutual fund or ETF represents a triumph of hope over experience.

This strategic move by the Board of Directors represents a significant milestone in the organization's journey toward generating greater clarity, public awareness, and impact in our community.

El Rio Reyes Conservation Trust was founded in 1999 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit land trust organization. The Trust's founders recognized that landowners along the Kings River, which contain some of the most fertile farmlands and natural resources in the region, needed an advocate and tools to help them achieve their conservation goals. The Trust began to serve communities along the Kings River watershed, specifically the residents of Fresno, Tulare, and Kings counties, by helping landowners voluntarily place their properties in permanent agricultural and natural habitat conservation easements to protect the land from harmful urban development.

After 25 years, it can be hard for an organization to make a bold decision like changing its name to Kings River Land Trust, but it is a smart decision none-the-less. In the realm of nonprofit land trusts, a name is more than just a label; it serves as a beacon that illuminates the organization's mission, values, and area of geographic focus. The decision to rebrand the organization is a testament to the board's commitment to adaptability and effectiveness.

The factors considered by the Board of Directors reflect a thoughtful and strategic approach to this change. Regional differentiation is crucial in a landscape of crowded conservation-focused organizations. By embracing the name Kings River Land Trust, the organization reaffirms its local connection and distinguishes itself within the vast network of more than 200 land trusts in California.

Additionally, the timing of this rebranding effort couldn't be more opportune. With significant new projects underway, additional recent large grants received, and new initiatives on the horizon, the name change serves as a fitting reflection of the organization's evolution and growth trajectory.

While the organization's original name held sentimental value, it often led to misunderstandings among supporters and stakeholders. The transition to Kings River Land Trust addresses these challenges head-on, offering a name that is not only shorter, but also more reflective of the organization's focus and purpose.

Of course, it is essential to acknowledge the logistical hurdles involved in such a transition. However, the organization's commitment to careful planning and transparent communication ensures a smooth and seamless process. As the new name is rolled out across various platforms, stakeholders can expect to see a consistent brand identity that maintains continuity while signaling a fresh chapter in the organization's journey.

Ultimately, the decision to rebrand as Kings River Land Trust signifies more than just a change in name; it represents a bold step towards a more impactful and sustainable future for our Kings River watershed. I am confident that this move will not only enhance the organization's visibility, but also strengthen its connection with the community and inspire greater engagement and support for its vital conservation efforts.

In closing, I commend the Board of Directors of the El Rio Reyes Conservation Trust, now Kings River Land Trust, for their vision, courage, and commitment to clarity and excellence. As their Executive Director, I look forward to leading and witnessing the positive outcomes that emerge from this bold step.",gvwire.com,news,GV Wire,,0.6392156862745098,448979586,1,https://gvwire.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22162346/Ditch-on-farmland.jpg-1.jpg,

This downward trend was influenced by forecasts of milder weather, abundant gas storage, and low gas flows to LNG export plants, primarily due to service outages at Freeport LNG's Texas plant. Freeport LNG announced that two of its three liquefaction trains would be offline until May for testing and repairs. Consequently, front-month gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped to their lowest close since March 15.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that current gas stockpiles were about 41% above typical levels. This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market. In the coming week, prices are expected to remain under pressure, reflecting these mixed influences.

According to official US data, last year some 70,000 Americans overdosed on the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Washington has named Mexico and China as the primary source countries for the drug and related substances trafficked directly into the US.

""Of course we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl,"" Lopez Obrador told media during a press conference.

Children in year six at Blue Coat Primary have taken part in workshop sessions where they have been able to experience hands-on inspiring engineering activities.

Organisers say the activities teach students a variety of engineering techniques and the models they make use recycled materials where possible.

One of the activities from this term was to make 'chairoplanes' using CDs, wine corks, water bottles and other household items, using an electrical circuit to power the device.

The club is run by STEM specialist Technology for Fun which was founded by Caroline Alliston in 2008.

It is also supported by Renishaw, who has been helping the club since 2012 by providing an ambassador during sessions.

Dr Suk Kinch, a principal design and development engineer, is a Renishaw ambassador who helped with this term's club sessions.

Dr Kinch has been working with Renishaw's neurological product line for the last thirteen years.

She said: ""I've been involved as a STEM ambassador for many years now, and my career was inspired by engineers coming into my school.

""These workshops allow the children to access a space where they can explore, be curious about technology and gain a tangible insight into a career as an engineer.""

Organiser Caroline Alliston said: ""One of the great things about getting Renishaw STEM ambassadors involved is that a high proportion of them are women.

""This helps break down the gender stereotype that STEM careers are only for men and provides girls with strong role models.

As a part of the government's AI vision in Amrit Kaal, the proposal sent by RR CAT, has already been accepted at department of atomic energy (DAE) level, a top official of RR CAT said at the sidelines of a welding conference here.

The move of the government is expected to help small business houses, mostly MSMEs, including start-ups in the country at a very low cost, in achieving economy in their productions and offering sustainability to the nation. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also lauded the entrepreneurial spirit of India's youth at Startup Mahakumbh, saying that the startup ecosystem is flourishing at an unprecedented pace. ""Through Startup India mission, the government has given a platform to innovative ideas, connected them to funding channels, and established incubators in educational institutions,"" PM Modi had said.

In the last Budget ahead of the general election, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also announced a corpus of Rs 1-lakh crore would be established with 50-year interest free loans to encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation in sunrise sectors. In line with the government's plan, RR CAT also emphasised the need of making an ecosystem in which smaller industries work in close collaboration with national research labs and reap the benefits of their knowledge, expertise and experience as well.

Speaking at the sidelines of the event, Abhay Kumar, head of design & manufacturing technology division at RRCAT said, ""The research labs too need to be incentivised for their extra efforts and time as they don't have the option of missing project deadlines. RRCAT is also helping three Indian industries through four collaborative incubations through Atal Incubation Centres (AIC-p-Hub) at RRCAT. The industries include a start-up metal & membrane where it is involved in development of full penetration TIG welding of porous pipes with solid pipes in materials like titanium and stainless steel,"" Kumar said.

Elaborating on a novel idea welding technology developed fully at RRCAT, Kumar also said that a tiny amount of nitrogen in the shield gas can bring tremendous amounts of benefits in stainless steel welds. ""It will improve fatigue, creep and corrosion resistance to offer substantial increase in the service life of the pressure equipment. Such small things costing almost nothing, will help SMEs achieve the production target and offer sustainability to the country's economy. It is also serving big industries like Godrej with two such collaborations.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$8.2b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 24% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Antero Resources, beginning with the chart below.

Check out our latest analysis for Antero Resources

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Antero Resources?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Antero Resources does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Antero Resources, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Antero Resources is not owned by hedge funds. FMR LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. With 9.1% and 8.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO Paul Rady is the owner of 4.3% of the company's shares.

We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Antero Resources

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Antero Resources Corporation. Insiders own US$416m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Antero Resources. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Antero Resources better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Antero Resources you should know about.

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downwards for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook, who said he had enjoyed an ""outstanding"" meeting with Li.

""I think China's really opening up, and I'm so happy to be here,"" the CEO of the United States' largest smartphone empire told a reporter from CGTN, according to a video posted on one of the state-run broadcaster's social media accounts.

In separate comments published online by state broadcaster CCTV, Cook said Apple would keep increasing its investment in research and development in China.

He added that Apple's flagship mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, would hit shelves in China by the end of this year, according to a social media post that carried his remarks in Chinese translation only.

Cook was in Shanghai to open a new Apple store this week, and on Friday discussed the company's expansion plans in China with the country's commerce minister, Wang Wentao.",thepeninsulaqatar.com,news,The Peninsula,,0.1058823529411765,448979117,1,http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240324_1711282279-427.jpeg?1711282279,

Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will soon introduce porous concrete at multiple public spaces like footpaths, parking lots, and pathways in parks to ensure that water can easily sink in and enhance the groundwater levels.

GHMC Commissioner Ronald Rose, who witnessed a demonstration of the porous blocks asked the officials to conduct a pilot project to conserve water in city.

Rose had previously instructed the officials and Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste management agency Re Sustainability Limited to make pervious concrete and tiles by using C&D recycled material which can percolate the rainwater into the ground.

The recycled metal, sand, stones, and concrete blocks from these plants would also be used for building these structures. The authorities are planning to first lay a footpath as an R&D project, which they would later scale up to a city-wide practice.

Amgen is taking a new approach as it tries to stand out in a crowded field of drugmakers racing to develop the next blockbuster weight loss drug.

The biotech company is testing an injectable treatment that helps people lose weight differently from the existing injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and other obesity medicines in development. Amgen's treatment, called MariTide, also appears to help patients keep weight off after they stop taking it.

The drugmaker is also testing its drug to be taken once a month or even less frequently, which could offer more convenience than the weekly medicines on the market.

It's too early to say how competitive Amgen will be in the budding weight loss drug space, which Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have so far dominated. Some analysts expect the market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, potentially leaving room for new competitors to enter. Goldman Sachs also projects that between 10 million and 70 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2028.

The available data on Amgen's injectable drug is promising, but it's from a small, early-stage trial. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company also is developing an oral medicine and other treatments for obesity, but has disclosed few details about them.

Investors and health experts will likely get a better idea of Amgen's prospects later this year: The drugmaker expects to release initial data from an ongoing mid-stage trial on MariTide, along with phase one data on its obesity pill.

It's also unclear whether Amgen's treatments will be cheaper than the existing weight loss drugs, which cost around $1,000 per month.

Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Zepbound from Eli Lilly lead a new class of obesity treatments that has drawn unrelenting patient demand -- and investor interest -- despite their hefty price tags and limited insurance coverage.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also struggled to offer enough supply of their treatments, which could give other companies a chance to win market share.

Amgen's drug offers a new twist on weight loss.

Much like Wegovy and Zepbound, one part of Amgen's treatment activates a gut hormone receptor called GLP-1 to help regulate a person's appetite.

But while Zepbound triggers a second hormone receptor called GIP, Amgen's drug blocks it. Wegovy does not target GIP, which suppresses appetite like GLP-1 but may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Amgen's decision to tamp down rather than boost GIP is based on genetics research suggesting that blocking the receptor could help patients lose more body weight, company executives have said.

That appears to contradict how Zepbound works. Eli Lilly's approach has proven successful: The treatment helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.

But Amgen's MartiTide also was effective in a small, early-stage study.

Patients given the highest dose of Amgen's drug -- 420 milligrams -- every month lost 14.5% of their body weight on average in just 12 weeks, according to the phase one trial published last month in the journal Nature Metabolism.

Amgen's treatment may be better at helping people maintain weight loss than competitors, even though patients take it less frequently, early-stage trial data suggests.

Amgen's study enrolled 110 patients with obesity but not diabetes. Patients in one group were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the drug and were followed for 150 days, while a second group was given a dose every four weeks for three months.

Patients who received a single shot of the highest dose of MariTide lost up to 8.2% of their body weight after 92 days. That suggests a single injection of the drug has a prolonged weight loss effect, according to the study authors.

In the group that received multiple doses of the drug, patients appeared to maintain their maximum weight loss until around two months after their last dose. Their body weight started to slowly return after that. Still, their weight was as much as 11.2% lower five months after they received the last dose.

""We think meaningful weight loss is already 5%. If you take Amgen's drug, lose 14.5%, stop the drug and still have 11.2% weight loss after a few months, that's significant,"" said Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone Health and an obesity medicine physician. But she pointed out the need to study the treatment in a larger group of people.

The sustained weight loss in Amgen's study appears to contrast with results seen in clinical trials on Zepbound and Wegovy. Patients in those studies saw their weight rebound sooner after stopping the injections.

The frequency of Amgen's drug also sets it apart. Those on Wegovy or Zepbound have to take doses weekly, compared with the once-monthly MariTide.

Amgen's trial used monthly dosing in part because patients saw sustained weight loss whether they had a single injection or multiple shots of the company's drug, according to the study authors.

Amgen's treatment also can stay in the body for much longer than current therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound because it includes a monoclonal antibody, the authors added.

Amgen's MariTide ""has that advantage where it's just going to last a lot longer. Even if you give a high dose, you're still going to have drug exposure in the body for a month or two months, so that clearly shows you don't need to take it every week,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC.

Phipps said people typically don't want to get injections often, so some patients could prefer a monthly shot like Amgen's MariTide for a disease that will likely require chronic treatment.

But he noted that a patient's choice may also depend on whether the level of weight loss and side effects of Amgen's drug end up being on par with those of the existing weekly injections.

Amgen's ongoing phase two trial is exploring whether patients can take its drug even less frequently than once a month.

Amgen's longer-term phase two study on nearly 600 patients will provide more clarity on how competitive MariTide will be against Wegovy and Zepbound. The company is exploring which dose and schedule is best for patients. It expects to release initial trial results later this year.

Some analysts have said the phase two trial could help address several questions, including how well patients tolerate the treatment.

The 52-week study is testing 11 different patient groups at a variety of dosing levels and regimens. That includes starting some patients at a lower dose of a drug and gradually increasing it until they reach a higher target dose.

That dose escalation could help reduce side effects that some patients experienced after taking their first dose of MariTide in the phase one trial, according to Phipps.

In that trial, the safety and side effects of Amgen's drug were similar to other GLP-1 medications. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects, and typically lasted for about 72 hours.

Four out of eight patients in a group receiving the highest dose of the treatment withdrew before getting a second shot due to mild gastrointestinal issues, according to the study. But no other patients stopped taking the drug due to adverse events across any of the different dosing groups, Amgen Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said during a conference earlier this month.

""It's a little early to jump to the conclusion that the drug won't be tolerated by patients based on this phase one data,"" Phipps said.

Another part of Amgen's phase two trial will also examine weight loss beyond 52 weeks, which will provide a clearer picture of how long the drug is effective.",nbclosangeles.com,news,NBC Southern California,,0.06666666666666665,448978993,1,https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/02/107368557-17069062502023-12-13t123425z_1803569422_rc26v4aidh6r_rtrmadp_0_health-obesity-telehealth.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

A water crisis has gripped India's fourth-biggest city.

The 15 million people who live in and around Bangaluru are confronting a water shortage that has led to rising costs of water amidst sharp restrictions on use and rationing of water. People are skipping work and forming lines to receive rationed supplies of what is one of the world's most abundant resources. Yet too often there isn't enough of it -- a fact that the United Nations tries to highlight each year on March 22, which is World Water Day.

I live and work in the state of Bihar, which is more than 1,000 miles north of Bangalore. Water is plentiful in our area. We enjoy normal rains and droughts are almost nonexistent.

Yet, I worry about water conservation. As the climate continues to change, our farms are being affected in many ways. The biggest damaging effect is caused by the 'Loo' - hot and warm winds from the west. I'm always looking for ways to use less water without compromising yield. This strategy is essential to my farm's productivity and the future availability of water.

My greatest ally in meeting this challenge is technology.

In my 34 years as a farmer, I've learned a lot about growing food. This year, I'll raise wheat and corn as well as a wide range of fruits: bananas, guavas, strawberries, dragon fruit, sweet limes, litchi, and mangos.

I've also learned how much farmers can accomplish when they gain access to the best technologies, from mechanization to seed genetics.

At the center of my experience is micro-irrigation, which allows me to control the flow of water to my crops, delivering droplets in precise amounts at exactly the right time. We waste nothing due to this slow-release of water.

We aren't just saving water, though. We're in fact boosting yield because micro-irrigation allows us to use water when our crops need it the most.

Temperatures in our region can spike to 45 degrees Celsius (or about 113 degrees Fahrenheit). When hot winds blow, our trees and plants tend to shed fruits and flowers. That's what crops do when they don't have enough resources: They sacrifice some of what they have to protect the rest, like sailors who throw cargo overboard to lighten a ship during a storm.

Even then, the fruit that remains are in danger, as hot and dry weather accompanied with poor control of moisture leads to a bad seed-to-pulp ratio which can make the fruits less valuable or even worthless.

Another wonderful innovation that I was able to do on my farm is use the micro sprinkler not as an irrigation tool but as a micro climate management tool in the orchard. I did this experiment in my litchi orchard and got tremendous results. When the hot 'Loo' wind blows we switch on the sprinklers in my orchard. One under each tree. The result is that the sprinklers become one giant cooler. It reduces the temperature in the orchard by 3-4 degrees. It increases the humidity in the orchard during this extreme dry period. This difference is so perceptible that when one crosses the orchard or enters it one feels the sudden coolness compared to the outside. This prevents the litchi fruits from getting scorched or from cracking which is the biggest problem for this crop. In this way we can counter the adverse effect of the hottest days during the litchi season. In this we are assisted by our on farm self-uploading weather station which gives an hourly update on the mobile. Thus, letting us know in advance the weather conditions that are going to prevail so that we can plan to take counter measures. Thus, technology comes to our help over and over again.

Before micro-irrigation, I had no way to prevent these losses. My mango and litchi crops were especially vulnerable. I'd watch them wither in just a few days.

The solution was never a mystery. I always knew that it was efficient use of water. I used to dream about getting water to every plant in my field instantly. I just didn't know how to turn this dream into a reality.

On a trip to the United States sponsored by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), I learned about micro-irrigation and how it could allow me to pump water to our trees and plants quickly and efficiently, across large fields and in the amounts necessary to help our crops hydrate to give the best results.

When I returned home, I installed a micro irrigation system. I've made continuous improvements, too, adding micro sprinklers under my trees in addition to drip irrigation, plus weather stations that provide real-time information, soil sensors that detect moisture and temperature, and mulch coverings that further prevents moisture loss and controls weeds.

I spend much of my time trying to share my experiences. In the last four years, more than 8,000 farmers have visited my farm to learn what technology can do for them.

My next project will involve automated fertigation, which will allow me to fertilize crops through my irrigation network. I expect that this will help me conserve another resource, lower costs, and improve yields. I'm also hoping to shift away from grains and move further into fruits, which can deliver up to ten times more income than cereal crops.

My wish list for technology includes GMOs and gene-edited seeds that promote water and fertilizer efficiency in crops along with disease control. Although my government has embraced many technologies, it has resisted these innovations in farming, which would help farmers in my region and beyond. A United Nations research group says that about half the world's population face severe water scarcity for at least one month per year.

The cause behind Bangaluru's current water crisis is a weak monsoon season and an unregulated withdrawal of ground water without recharging it. The once garden city of India has turned into a vast concrete jungle. Rain water harvesting to charge the ground water has to be made mandatory.

The city is called ""the Silicon Valley of India"" -- and I hope its suffering ends soon. In the meantime, though, perhaps this hub of technology reminds us about the urgent need for judicious use of water. Urgent use of good technology for water management. For water surplus areas like ours the situation in Bengaluru should be a warning. A warning to treasure water like gold. To use technology to conserve water and use it judiciously or perish.",agweb.com,news,AgWeb,,-0.0117647058823529,448978990,10,,

We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.

Amgen is taking a new approach as it tries to stand out in a crowded field of drugmakers racing to develop the next blockbuster weight loss drug.

The biotech company is testing an injectable treatment that helps people lose weight differently from the existing injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and other obesity medicines in development. Amgen's treatment, called MariTide, also appears to help patients keep weight off after they stop taking it.

The drugmaker is also testing its drug to be taken once a month or even less frequently, which could offer more convenience than the weekly medicines on the market.

It's too early to say how competitive Amgen will be in the budding weight loss drug space, which Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have so far dominated. Some analysts expect the market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, potentially leaving room for new competitors to enter. Goldman Sachs also projects that between 10 million and 70 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2028.

The available data on Amgen's injectable drug is promising, but it's from a small, early-stage trial. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company also is developing an oral medicine and other treatments for obesity, but has disclosed few details about them.

Investors and health experts will likely get a better idea of Amgen's prospects later this year: The drugmaker expects to release initial data from an ongoing mid-stage trial on MariTide, along with phase one data on its obesity pill.

It's also unclear whether Amgen's treatments will be cheaper than the existing weight loss drugs, which cost around $1,000 per month.

Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Zepbound from Eli Lilly lead a new class of obesity treatments that has drawn unrelenting patient demand -- and investor interest -- despite their hefty price tags and limited insurance coverage.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also struggled to offer enough supply of their treatments, which could give other companies a chance to win market share.

Amgen's drug offers a new twist on weight loss.

Much like Wegovy and Zepbound, one part of Amgen's treatment activates a gut hormone receptor called GLP-1 to help regulate a person's appetite.

But while Zepbound triggers a second hormone receptor called GIP, Amgen's drug blocks it. Wegovy does not target GIP, which suppresses appetite like GLP-1 but may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Amgen's decision to tamp down rather than boost GIP is based on genetics research suggesting that blocking the receptor could help patients lose more body weight, company executives have said.

That appears to contradict how Zepbound works. Eli Lilly's approach has proven successful: The treatment helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.

But Amgen's MartiTide also was effective in a small, early-stage study.

Patients given the highest dose of Amgen's drug -- 420 milligrams -- every month lost 14.5% of their body weight on average in just 12 weeks, according to the phase one trial published last month in the journal Nature Metabolism.

Amgen's treatment may be better at helping people maintain weight loss than competitors, even though patients take it less frequently, early-stage trial data suggests.

Amgen's study enrolled 110 patients with obesity but not diabetes. Patients in one group were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the drug and were followed for 150 days, while a second group was given a dose every four weeks for three months.

Patients who received a single shot of the highest dose of MariTide lost up to 8.2% of their body weight after 92 days. That suggests a single injection of the drug has a prolonged weight loss effect, according to the study authors.

In the group that received multiple doses of the drug, patients appeared to maintain their maximum weight loss until around two months after their last dose. Their body weight started to slowly return after that. Still, their weight was as much as 11.2% lower five months after they received the last dose.

""We think meaningful weight loss is already 5%. If you take Amgen's drug, lose 14.5%, stop the drug and still have 11.2% weight loss after a few months, that's significant,"" said Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone Health and an obesity medicine physician. But she pointed out the need to study the treatment in a larger group of people.

The sustained weight loss in Amgen's study appears to contrast with results seen in clinical trials on Zepbound and Wegovy. Patients in those studies saw their weight rebound sooner after stopping the injections.

The frequency of Amgen's drug also sets it apart. Those on Wegovy or Zepbound have to take doses weekly, compared with the once-monthly MariTide.

Amgen's trial used monthly dosing in part because patients saw sustained weight loss whether they had a single injection or multiple shots of the company's drug, according to the study authors.

Amgen's treatment also can stay in the body for much longer than current therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound because it includes a monoclonal antibody, the authors added.

Amgen's MariTide ""has that advantage where it's just going to last a lot longer. Even if you give a high dose, you're still going to have drug exposure in the body for a month or two months, so that clearly shows you don't need to take it every week,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC.

Phipps said people typically don't want to get injections often, so some patients could prefer a monthly shot like Amgen's MariTide for a disease that will likely require chronic treatment.

But he noted that a patient's choice may also depend on whether the level of weight loss and side effects of Amgen's drug end up being on par with those of the existing weekly injections.

Amgen's ongoing phase two trial is exploring whether patients can take its drug even less frequently than once a month.

Amgen's longer-term phase two study on nearly 600 patients will provide more clarity on how competitive MariTide will be against Wegovy and Zepbound. The company is exploring which dose and schedule is best for patients. It expects to release initial trial results later this year.

Some analysts have said the phase two trial could help address several questions, including how well patients tolerate the treatment.

The 52-week study is testing 11 different patient groups at a variety of dosing levels and regimens. That includes starting some patients at a lower dose of a drug and gradually increasing it until they reach a higher target dose.

That dose escalation could help reduce side effects that some patients experienced after taking their first dose of MariTide in the phase one trial, according to Phipps.

In that trial, the safety and side effects of Amgen's drug were similar to other GLP-1 medications. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects, and typically lasted for about 72 hours.

Four out of eight patients in a group receiving the highest dose of the treatment withdrew before getting a second shot due to mild gastrointestinal issues, according to the study. But no other patients stopped taking the drug due to adverse events across any of the different dosing groups, Amgen Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said during a conference earlier this month.

""It's a little early to jump to the conclusion that the drug won't be tolerated by patients based on this phase one data,"" Phipps said.

Another part of Amgen's phase two trial will also examine weight loss beyond 52 weeks, which will provide a clearer picture of how long the drug is effective.",nbcchicago.com,news,NBC Chicago,,0.03529411764705892,448978945,1,https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/02/107368557-17069062502023-12-13t123425z_1803569422_rc26v4aidh6r_rtrmadp_0_health-obesity-telehealth.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

Investors are reassessing their strategies after a pause in the stellar run of dollar-funded trades amid signs the Federal Reserve may not ease as aggressively as previously anticipated. Carry traders borrow in low-yielding countries to invest in higher-yielding assets, often in emerging markets. An ideal funding currency is characterized by low volatility and limited scope to strengthen.

While the yen remains the world's lowest-yielding currency despite the Bank of Japan's exit from negative rates, heightened expectations for its appreciation and volatility may deter borrowers. The yuan compares more favorably to the Taiwan dollar on those metrics and is more attractive than the greenback on both implied yield and volatility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China's managed currency has been kept in a tight range by Beijing this year, with little scope for appreciation given the sluggish economic conditions. A slide below a key support level on Friday suggested officials are comfortable with a further depreciation in the currency.

The yuan ""has become more of an option for funding with the People's Bank of China in easing mode as the economy struggles to find its footing,"" said Brendan McKenna, an emerging market economist and currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC.

Low volatility and a stable trading range ""makes a strong case"" for its suitability for carry trades, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a note on March 11.

Investors are looking for alternatives to dollar-based strategies amid signs the Fed might not ease as aggressively as some anticipated. Bloomberg's gauge of eight emerging market carry trades funded by the greenback lost 0.6% so far this quarter, after a 4.5% gain in the final three months of 2023.

Regarding the yuan, ""I wouldn't necessarily say bet on a huge devaluation, but if you want to look to carry trades I think that's a good one, absolutely,"" Olga Yangol, chief strategist, Americas, at Credit Agricole SA said prior to the raft of central bank action this week. Yangol said she's long on the Turkish lira and also likes some Asian currencies, but considers the Mexican peso expensive.

The yuan's one-month implied volatility hit its lowest since 2017 earlier this month before rising on Friday. The offshore yuan's interbank interest rates in Hong Kong, a benchmark gauge of offshore yuan's borrowing costs in Hong Kong, has fallen to around 3%, from a peak of nearly 4.5% in September.

An unexpected interest-rate increase in Taiwan this week, which pushed up the policy benchmark to its highest since 2008, may hurt the Taiwan dollar's carry appeal. Still, some analysts believe the hike, aimed at countering inflation, will be the last for this cycle.

Japan's still-low interest rates mean the yen is still considered attractive by some. When the BOJ raised rates for this first time in 17 years this week, Governor Kazuo Ueda made it clear policy would remain accommodative.

Yen overnight indexed swaps are pricing a rise in the BOJ's policy benchmark to around 0.3% in December.

""Carry trades are probably going to remain attractive with the yen as a funder,"" said Nicholas Chia, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. ""This will be conditional on the BOJ keeping rates lower for longer, which I think will be the case.""",bnnbloomberg.ca,news,BNN,,0.3019607843137255,448978818,1,http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2051025!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png,

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downwards for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook, who said he had enjoyed an ""outstanding"" meeting with Li.

""I think China's really opening up, and I'm so happy to be here,"" the CEO of the United States' largest smartphone empire told a reporter from CGTN, according to a video posted on one of the state-run broadcaster's social media accounts.

In separate comments published online by state broadcaster CCTV, Cook said Apple would keep increasing its investment in research and development in China.

He added that Apple's flagship mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, would hit shelves in China by the end of this year, according to a social media post that carried his remarks in Chinese translation only.

Cook was in Shanghai to open a new Apple store this week, and on Friday discussed the company's expansion plans in China with the country's commerce minister, Wang Wentao.",thepeninsulaqatar.com,news,The Peninsula,,0.03529411764705892,448978718,1,https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240324_1711282279-427.jpeg?1711282279,eng-9421105

Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.

Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.

Now the seismic settlement between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents' role, as people in other jobs - from the world of finance to travel - have already experienced.

Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers' agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.

""I think we are reaching a point where there's going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,"" Piskorski said. ""One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?""

Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.

""Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,"" Piskorski said. ""The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.""

Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.

""Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that's a good thing,"" Hale told CNN.

But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, ""will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.""

The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers' and sellers' agents. While previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.

Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.

Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.

Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.

""I really believe it's a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,"" he said.

Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase flights on their own.

""The buyers' agent will become, this is the part that's a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they're kind of pointing you in the right direction,"" he said. ""You know, 'this neighborhood has good schools,' all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you're hoping for that local expertise.""

A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill other duties of a buyers' agent, would ""significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.""

Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.

The real estate market, he said, is ""too complex to be completely automated on a computer.""

Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.

Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.

A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. ""Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,"" he said.

Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives.",cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,,0.0980392156862746,448978663,1,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/18/d62cc0ce-cd7a-4dcb-819d-0bf412915529/thumbnail/1200x630/a7c5c92151dd2be5491dbf5e9daf391f/6p-pkg-realtor-pay-laws-wcco4jix.jpg?v=4baa656f7af774a52a8c6a88476cb826,

Amgen is taking a new approach as it tries to stand out in a crowded field of drugmakers racing to develop the next blockbuster weight loss drug.

The biotech company is testing an injectable treatment that helps people lose weight differently from the existing injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and other obesity medicines in development. Amgen's treatment, called MariTide, also appears to help patients keep weight off after they stop taking it.

The drugmaker is also testing its drug to be taken once a month or even less frequently, which could offer more convenience than the weekly medicines on the market.

It's too early to say how competitive Amgen will be in the budding weight loss drug space, which Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have so far dominated. Some analysts expect the market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, potentially leaving room for new competitors to enter. Goldman Sachs also projects that between 10 million and 70 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2028.

The available data on Amgen's injectable drug is promising, but it's from a small, early-stage trial. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company also is developing an oral medicine and other treatments for obesity, but has disclosed few details about them.

Investors and health experts will likely get a better idea of Amgen's prospects later this year: The drugmaker expects to release initial data from an ongoing mid-stage trial on MariTide, along with phase one data on its obesity pill.

It's also unclear whether Amgen's treatments will be cheaper than the existing weight loss drugs, which cost around $1,000 per month.

Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Zepbound from Eli Lilly lead a new class of obesity treatments that has drawn unrelenting patient demand -- and investor interest -- despite their hefty price tags and limited insurance coverage.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also struggled to offer enough supply of their treatments, which could give other companies a chance to win market share.

Amgen's drug offers a new twist on weight loss.

Much like Wegovy and Zepbound, one part of Amgen's treatment activates a gut hormone receptor called GLP-1 to help regulate a person's appetite.

But while Zepbound triggers a second hormone receptor called GIP, Amgen's drug blocks it. Wegovy does not target GIP, which suppresses appetite like GLP-1 but may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Amgen's decision to tamp down rather than boost GIP is based on genetics research suggesting that blocking the receptor could help patients lose more body weight, company executives have said.

That appears to contradict how Zepbound works. Eli Lilly's approach has proven successful: The treatment helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.

But Amgen's MartiTide also was effective in a small, early-stage study.

Patients given the highest dose of Amgen's drug -- 420 milligrams -- every month lost 14.5% of their body weight on average in just 12 weeks, according to the phase one trial published last month in the journal Nature Metabolism.

Amgen's treatment may be better at helping people maintain weight loss than competitors, even though patients take it less frequently, early-stage trial data suggests.

Amgen's study enrolled 110 patients with obesity but not diabetes. Patients in one group were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the drug and were followed for 150 days, while a second group was given a dose every four weeks for three months.

Patients who received a single shot of the highest dose of MariTide lost up to 8.2% of their body weight after 92 days. That suggests a single injection of the drug has a prolonged weight loss effect, according to the study authors.

In the group that received multiple doses of the drug, patients appeared to maintain their maximum weight loss until around two months after their last dose. Their body weight started to slowly return after that. Still, their weight was as much as 11.2% lower five months after they received the last dose.

""We think meaningful weight loss is already 5%. If you take Amgen's drug, lose 14.5%, stop the drug and still have 11.2% weight loss after a few months, that's significant,"" said Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone Health and an obesity medicine physician. But she pointed out the need to study the treatment in a larger group of people.

The sustained weight loss in Amgen's study appears to contrast with results seen in clinical trials on Zepbound and Wegovy. Patients in those studies saw their weight rebound sooner after stopping the injections.

The frequency of Amgen's drug also sets it apart. Those on Wegovy or Zepbound have to take doses weekly, compared with the once-monthly MariTide.

Amgen's trial used monthly dosing in part because patients saw sustained weight loss whether they had a single injection or multiple shots of the company's drug, according to the study authors.

Amgen's treatment also can stay in the body for much longer than current therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound because it includes a monoclonal antibody, the authors added.

Amgen's MariTide ""has that advantage where it's just going to last a lot longer. Even if you give a high dose, you're still going to have drug exposure in the body for a month or two months, so that clearly shows you don't need to take it every week,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC.

Phipps said people typically don't want to get injections often, so some patients could prefer a monthly shot like Amgen's MariTide for a disease that will likely require chronic treatment.

But he noted that a patient's choice may also depend on whether the level of weight loss and side effects of Amgen's drug end up being on par with those of the existing weekly injections.

Amgen's ongoing phase two trial is exploring whether patients can take its drug even less frequently than once a month.

Amgen's longer-term phase two study on nearly 600 patients will provide more clarity on how competitive MariTide will be against Wegovy and Zepbound. The company is exploring which dose and schedule is best for patients. It expects to release initial trial results later this year.

Some analysts have said the phase two trial could help address several questions, including how well patients tolerate the treatment.

The 52-week study is testing 11 different patient groups at a variety of dosing levels and regimens. That includes starting some patients at a lower dose of a drug and gradually increasing it until they reach a higher target dose.

That dose escalation could help reduce side effects that some patients experienced after taking their first dose of MariTide in the phase one trial, according to Phipps.

In that trial, the safety and side effects of Amgen's drug were similar to other GLP-1 medications. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects, and typically lasted for about 72 hours.

Four out of eight patients in a group receiving the highest dose of the treatment withdrew before getting a second shot due to mild gastrointestinal issues, according to the study. But no other patients stopped taking the drug due to adverse events across any of the different dosing groups, Amgen Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said during a conference earlier this month.

""It's a little early to jump to the conclusion that the drug won't be tolerated by patients based on this phase one data,"" Phipps said.

Another part of Amgen's phase two trial will also examine weight loss beyond 52 weeks, which will provide a clearer picture of how long the drug is effective.",nbcnewyork.com,news,NBC New York,,0.06666666666666665,448978565,1,https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/02/107368557-17069062502023-12-13t123425z_1803569422_rc26v4aidh6r_rtrmadp_0_health-obesity-telehealth.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

Over the years, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has offered various justifications for his ""hugs, no bullets"" policy aimed at avoiding clashes with cartels. In the past he has said ""you cannot fight violence with violence"", and on other occasions he has argued that the government must address ""the causes"" of drug cartel violence, attributing them to poverty or lack of opportunities.

But on Friday, while speaking about his refusal to take on the cartels, he made clear that he saw it as part of what he called a ""Mexico first"" policy.

""We are not going to act as police for a foreign government,"" Lpez Obrador said during his daily press briefing. ""Mexico first. Our home comes first.""

López Obrador essentially argued that drugs were an American problem, not a Mexican one. He offered to help limit the flow of drugs into the United States, but only, he said, for humanitarian reasons.

""Of course, we will cooperate in the fight against drugs, especially because it has become a very sensitive and very sad humanitarian issue, because many young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl,"" the president said. More than 70,000 Americans die each year from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are primarily manufactured in Mexico from precursor chemicals smuggled from China.

López Obrador's view - like many of his policies - dates back to the 1970s, a period when many officials believed that Mexican cartels selling drugs to gringos were an American problem, not a Mexican one.

Biden sought to highlight how Republicans failed to reach a bipartisan deal on border security at Trump's behest.

""For decades, previous Mexican administrations thought that the war against drug cartels was primarily an American problem,"" said security analyst David Saucedo, pointing out that domestic drug use in Mexico, although it is increasing - particularly methamphetamines - remains at relatively low levels.

""On the other hand, drug cartels create jobs in areas where the Mexican government cannot provide economic development, encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade deficits and investment.""

López Obrador has previously spoken out against the ""demonization"" of drug cartels and encouraged Catholic Church leaders to try to broker peace pacts between warring gangs.

Explaining why he ordered the military not to attack cartel gunmen, Lpez Obrador said in 2022: ""we also take care of the lives of gang members, they are human beings.""

He also sometimes seemed not to take the issue of violence seriously. In June 2023, he said of a drug gang that had kidnapped 14 police officers: ""I'm going to tell your fathers and grandfathers about you"", suggesting they should get a good spanking.

Asked at the time about the comments, residents of a town in the western Mexican state of Michoacan, who have lived under the control of a drug cartel for years, reacted with disgust and incredulity.

""He's laughing at us,"" said one restaurateur, who asked to remain anonymous because he has long been forced -- like almost everyone else in town -- to pay protection money to the local cartel.

""The president has said loud and clear what we have long suspected, which is that his administration is not really fighting drug cartels,"" said Saucedo, the security analyst. ""He has only decided to administer the conflict, launching what could in the future be a crusade against the cartels that he will not have to fight.""

In this December 1, 2020 file photo, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks at the National Palace in Mexico City.

López Obrador also made a point of visiting at least half a dozen times the town of Badiraguato, in the state of Sinaloa, where drug lords like Joaqun ""El Chapo"" Guzman live, and pledged to do so again before leaving office in September.

It is also a position linked to prickly nationalism and independence. When asked in November why he had visited the sparsely populated rural commune so often, Lpez Obrador cited a line from an old drinking song, ""because I want to.""

The president has imposed strict limits on U.S. agents operating in Mexico, as well as the contact Mexican law enforcement can have with them.

The U.S. Embassy in Mexico had no comment on López Obrador's latest remarks. But he noted that the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Friday against a Sinaloa Cartel money laundering ring in which proceeds from the sale of fentanyl were used to buy shipments of cell phones to the United States , which were then sold to Mexico.

John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, highlighted ""a strong partnership with the government of Mexico, with which we have coordinated closely and for which we are grateful,"" in the investigation into this matter .

Although Mexico has arrested some high-profile gang members, government policy no longer matches what Mexico's drug cartels have become: extortion machines that make much of their money, not by trafficking drugs, but extorting protection payments from businessmen, farmers and traders. and street vendors, killing anyone who doesn't pay.

They take over legitimate businesses, kill rival drug dealers and murder bus and taxi drivers who refuse to police them.

The cartels control increasingly large swaths of territory, both in northern Mexico - their traditional base - and in southern states like Guerrero, Michoacan, Chiapas and Veracruz.

It is unclear whether peaceful coexistence was ever possible with Mexican drug gangs. Even though some regions have been producing marijuana or opium poppies for at least 50 years, the illegal trade has always led to violence.

Lpez Obrador says the ""Mexico First"" policy is necessary to reduce domestic violence. Last year, he claimed Mexico saw a 17 percent drop in homicides under his administration. But in fact, homicides had already fallen by about 7% from their peak in mid-2018 when Lpez Obrador took office in December of that year. The president essentially takes credit for a decline that began under his predecessor, Enrique Pea Nieto.

The most reliable annual count shows homicides in Mexico fell 9.7% in 2022 compared to 2021, the first significant decline under the current administration. Mexico's National Statistics Institute said there were 32,223 murders in 2022.

The country's homicide rate per 100,000 people increased from about 28 in 2021 to 25 in 2022. For comparison, the U.S. homicide rate in 2021 was about 7.8 per 100 000 inhabitants.

Recently, in the JEC World composite exhibition, we have noticed a growing number of 3D printing machines and technologies being launched on the market to enable new applications of composites, especially those in the industries of aerospace, automotive, etc. As compared with pure resin and short fibre-reinforced composites, continuous fibre-reinforced composites can achieve better mechanical performance, i.e., stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratio, such that 3D printing technology in continuous fibre-reinforced composites has been attracting increasing attention. Currently, there are still limitations that need to be addressed in the printing of continuous fibre-reinforced composites, e.g., poor impregnation, internal porosity defects, size limit, low fibre volume fraction, etc.

To account for these big challenges, this Special Issue is dedicated to the field of novel and engineering solutions in 3D printing of continuous fibre-reinforced composites (based on micromachines). Briefly, this Special Issue particularly focuses on but is not limited to the 3D printing of composites with respect to advances in the design, manufacturing, and characterisation of composite products using 3D printing technology (with micromachines).

MORE Power said in a statement its current effective electricity rate went up to P10.0216 kWh from P9.96 per kWh in February.

The power distributor attributed the March rate increase to the P0.18-per-kWh adjustment in transmission charges due to ancillary services cost charged by the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP).

It said the ancillary service (AS) rates increased from the previous month following the full commercial operations of the Reserve Market on Jan. 26, 2024.

The Reserve Market is where all power generation companies with generating capacity/units capable of providing AS can offer and sell even without an ancillary service procurement agreement (ASPA) with NGCP.

The government asked NGCP to procure firm AS contracts to ensure security of supply.

""A large increase in the AS cost was due to the contingency reserve, with an increase almost 4 times that of the previous month. Contingency reserve are those power plants that is intended to take care of the loss of the largest synchronized generating unit in the grid,"" MORE Power said.

The Visayas grid procures most of its contingency reserve requirement from the Reserve Market.

""With the tight supply and the on-going maintenance of power plants in the Visayas grid, there is very thin supply offered in the Reserve Market jacking up prices for this month. Most of the participants in the reserve market are also coal suppliers and diesel plants from the Visayas grid,"" MORE Power said.

PCPC said its 135-megawatt circulating fluidized bed coal (CFBC) plant would not be able to return online on March 30, but assured it would make available replacement power at no additional cost to customers.

""Until March 30, it will be status quo since that is the scheduled maintenance of PCPC. On March 31, CNP3 will be completed, so replacement power for PCPC can be sourced outside of Panay island,"" DOE Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said.

PCPC said it is conducting its annual preventive maintenance service (PMS) schedule for its coal plant from February 18 to March 30, 2024.

It was discovered that the generator sustained stator insulation damage, and the damaged parts needed to be replaced to ensure the power plant's long-term viability.

The biotech company is testing an injectable treatment that helps people lose weight differently from the existing injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and other obesity medicines in development. Amgen's treatment, called MariTide, also appears to help patients keep weight off after they stop taking it.

The drugmaker is also testing its drug to be taken once a month or even less frequently, which could offer more convenience than the weekly medicines on the market.

It's too early to say how competitive Amgen will be in the budding weight loss drug space, which Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have so far dominated. Some analysts expect the market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, potentially leaving room for new competitors to enter. Goldman Sachs also projects that between 10 million and 70 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2028.

The available data on Amgen's injectable drug is promising, but it's from a small, early-stage trial. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company also is developing an oral medicine and other treatments for obesity, but has disclosed few details about them.

Investors and health experts will likely get a better idea of Amgen's prospects later this year: The drugmaker expects to release initial data from an ongoing mid-stage trial on MariTide, along with phase one data on its obesity pill.

It's also unclear whether Amgen's treatments will be cheaper than the existing weight loss drugs, which cost around $1,000 per month.

Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Zepbound from Eli Lilly lead a new class of obesity treatments that has drawn unrelenting patient demand -- and investor interest -- despite their hefty price tags and limited insurance coverage.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also struggled to offer enough supply of their treatments, which could give other companies a chance to win market share.

Amgen's drug offers a new twist on weight loss.

Much like Wegovy and Zepbound, one part of Amgen's treatment activates a gut hormone receptor called GLP-1 to help regulate a person's appetite.

But while Zepbound triggers a second hormone receptor called GIP, Amgen's drug blocks it. Wegovy does not target GIP, which suppresses appetite like GLP-1 but may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Amgen's decision to tamp down rather than boost GIP is based on genetics research suggesting that blocking the receptor could help patients lose more body weight, company executives have said.

That appears to contradict how Zepbound works. Eli Lilly's approach has proven successful: The treatment helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.

But Amgen's MartiTide also was effective in a small, early-stage study.

Patients given the highest dose of Amgen's drug -- 420 milligrams -- every month lost 14.5% of their body weight on average in just 12 weeks, according to the phase one trial published last month in the journal Nature Metabolism.

Amgen's treatment may be better at helping people maintain weight loss than competitors, even though patients take it less frequently, early-stage trial data suggests.

Amgen's study enrolled 110 patients with obesity but not diabetes. Patients in one group were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the drug and were followed for 150 days, while a second group was given a dose every four weeks for three months.

Patients who received a single shot of the highest dose of MariTide lost up to 8.2% of their body weight after 92 days. That suggests a single injection of the drug has a prolonged weight loss effect, according to the study authors.

In the group that received multiple doses of the drug, patients appeared to maintain their maximum weight loss until around two months after their last dose. Their body weight started to slowly return after that. Still, their weight was as much as 11.2% lower five months after they received the last dose.

""We think meaningful weight loss is already 5%. If you take Amgen's drug, lose 14.5%, stop the drug and still have 11.2% weight loss after a few months, that's significant,"" said Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone Health and an obesity medicine physician. But she pointed out the need to study the treatment in a larger group of people.

The sustained weight loss in Amgen's study appears to contrast with results seen in clinical trials on Zepbound and Wegovy. Patients in those studies saw their weight rebound sooner after stopping the injections.

The frequency of Amgen's drug also sets it apart. Those on Wegovy or Zepbound have to take doses weekly, compared with the once-monthly MariTide.

Amgen's trial used monthly dosing in part because patients saw sustained weight loss whether they had a single injection or multiple shots of the company's drug, according to the study authors.

Amgen's treatment also can stay in the body for much longer than current therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound because it includes a monoclonal antibody, the authors added.

Amgen's MariTide ""has that advantage where it's just going to last a lot longer. Even if you give a high dose, you're still going to have drug exposure in the body for a month or two months, so that clearly shows you don't need to take it every week,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC.

Phipps said people typically don't want to get injections often, so some patients could prefer a monthly shot like Amgen's MariTide for a disease that will likely require chronic treatment.

But he noted that a patient's choice may also depend on whether the level of weight loss and side effects of Amgen's drug end up being on par with those of the existing weekly injections.

Amgen's ongoing phase two trial is exploring whether patients can take its drug even less frequently than once a month.

Amgen's longer-term phase two study on nearly 600 patients will provide more clarity on how competitive MariTide will be against Wegovy and Zepbound. The company is exploring which dose and schedule is best for patients. It expects to release initial trial results later this year.

Some analysts have said the phase two trial could help address several questions, including how well patients tolerate the treatment.

The 52-week study is testing 11 different patient groups at a variety of dosing levels and regimens. That includes starting some patients at a lower dose of a drug and gradually increasing it until they reach a higher target dose.

That dose escalation could help reduce side effects that some patients experienced after taking their first dose of MariTide in the phase one trial, according to Phipps.

In that trial, the safety and side effects of Amgen's drug were similar to other GLP-1 medications. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects, and typically lasted for about 72 hours.

Four out of eight patients in a group receiving the highest dose of the treatment withdrew before getting a second shot due to mild gastrointestinal issues, according to the study. But no other patients stopped taking the drug due to adverse events across any of the different dosing groups, Amgen Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said during a conference earlier this month.

""It's a little early to jump to the conclusion that the drug won't be tolerated by patients based on this phase one data,"" Phipps said.

Another part of Amgen's phase two trial will also examine weight loss beyond 52 weeks, which will provide a clearer picture of how long the drug is effective.",nbcnewyork.com,news,NBC New York,Annika Kim Constantino,0.02745098039215677,448978359,1,https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/02/107368557-17069062502023-12-13t123425z_1803569422_rc26v4aidh6r_rtrmadp_0_health-obesity-telehealth.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

As part of its commitment towards carbon neutrality, the Indian government has been encouraging the automakers to thrive for electric vehicles, which will help reduce the country's vehicular emissions. However, this push to boost the domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles may result in large-scale entry of Chinese automakers into the Indian domestic market, claimed a report by the think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).

The findings come at a time when the global automobile industry is witnessing a massive rise in Chinese auto companies, which are aggressively thriving to grab the electric vehicle markets across different continents with their affordable offerings, aided by substantial support from the Chinese government. Speaking about the projection, GTRI has said that China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has grown rapidly in electric vehicle technology, making it a major exporter of EVs and related components.

The report also stated that the renewed policy push to make India a hub for electric vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will result in a sharp increase in dependence on auto component imports from China. Interestingly, India's auto component imports were $20.3 billion in 2022-23 and about 30 per cent of it came from China. As electric vehicles are getting greater focus in India, the auto component imports from China may increase further because it has a greater hold over the EV components' global supply chain, the report said.

Currently, China has 75 per cent of the world's battery production capacity and battery packs account for 40 per cent of the total sticker price of an electric vehicle. China also accounts for more than 50 per cent of global electric vehicle production and exports to markets around the world. While making projections about the Indian electric mobility scenario, the report said that in the next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on Indian roads could be those made by Chinese auto companies. These could be directly by the Chinese OEMs or through joint ventures with Indian companies.

The report also stated that entry to the Indian market could provide a major relief to Chinese companies, as their exports to the European Union and the United States are declining owing to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars and EV batteries. Interestingly, this projection comes on the heels of the introduction of JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group. Forming the JV, the two companies announced that under the JSW MG Motor India, there will be an investment of ₹5,000 crore in India to enhance the production capacity locally. Also, the company aims to launch one new car in India every three to six months starting in September 2024.",auto.hindustantimes.com,news,https://auto.hindustantimes.com,Ht Auto Desk,0.3803921568627451,448978058,1,https://images.hindustantimes.com/auto/img/2024/03/24/1600x900/electric_vehicle_1704186388371_1711280819270.JPG,eng-9418000

But why would you want a smart ring in the first place?

The short answer is that they are likely to fulfil the same health and activity tracking as a watch, leaving your wrist free for a more fashionable or traditional timepiece.

But they can also track the your body's movements much more precisely than other wearable technology, and record detailed information about the movement of your hands. This could allow you to control and interact with other technology in new ways - but also raise even more concerns about privacy.

The Oura ring has been available since 2015 and one of us, Max, has been wearing one for more than five years. He does this to track sleep and activity data during times when he does not want to wear a watch (including sleeping). These rings track changes in your body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability (the time intervals between heart beats), blood oxygen levels, and physical activity. A smart watch can also do much of this.

It is expected that the Galaxy Ring will do the same (at least that is what one of their announcements focuses on), and be added to its health and fitness range.

Meanwhile, Apple's patent application indicates that its version may do more than monitor health. It may help control other devices, and vibrate to give users notifications.

Fingers are better than wrists at making specific gestures. With many more finger gesture options than arm positions, and finger gestures being the primary mode of interaction for VR (virtual reality) headsets, one probable future for smart rings is to control other devices. This would allow for the more precise detection of actions like pinching and pointing.

Multiple rings could work together to achieve this, with other devices. Apple's ring patent, for example, implies that rings could be worn in different bands along the length of a single finger (not an uncommon choice with normal rings), allowing a company to know how your finger is angled. If communicating with a watch, smart rings could detect finger and hand position in relation to your arm. This potentially provides more precise interactions with VR headsets.

In being able to carefully track fingers, rather than wrists, smart rings might allow technology companies to understand, model, and help improve many more activities, especially in situations where cameras and sensors are less likely to be found.

One example of this is learning to play classical guitar, which does not involve as much strumming with the whole arm or at the wrist, but where all the skill is in the fingers. Bringing sensors closer to the body's more dexterous touch sensors means that technology companies can more closely understand what you are doing.

Rings are jewellery, often worn to be seen. Apple is well known for making aesthetics a priority in its products. While the Galaxy ring looks a lot like the Oura Ring, it's likely that Apple will consider the importance of personalisation and style.

Rings are not just worn on fingers, of course. Could rings for piercings, that go inside the body to some extent, like those on our ears or lips, give us additional data on ourselves?

There might also be value in incorporating smart technology into other adornments. There are already smart products designed to be worn as necklaces. Potentially necklaces could help monitor stress levels because stress is closely linked to breathing patterns. There has also been a smart bra.

The most well-known association that a ring has is as a gift of commitment and attachment. Researchers have looked at how we can use digital technology to communicate with loved ones who are not physically present. Apple's smart ring patent includes haptic feedback (where technology applies forces or vibrations to the user to simulate the experience of touch).

Smart wedding rings could be used to transmit messages between partners - to let one of them know the other is thinking about them. For example, an interaction such as twisting the ring could make your partner's ring vibrate.

However, new smart devices will generate new forms of data and tracking, raising important questions about privacy and ethics. As with other wearable technology, there may be things people do not want to track. Imagine a message from your workplace telling you: ""We see you aren't typing at your desk right now.""

Social problems are also a possibility. If smart technology was incorporated into wedding rings, it could give people a way of tracking what their partners are doing even more closely than smartphones can.

These questions highlight the importance of governments focusing on the responsible use of AI, as well as responsible innovation. Research shows that over half of British people (52%) feel like they do not know how their personal data is being collected and used.

Companies could create more targeted advertising based on changing circumstances, as when someone learns they are pregnant. Some regions of the world even offer cheaper life insurance to people with better health data from wearables.

What we should ask is: what is responsible and irresponsible for companies to track and try to infer about people from their wearables? This question should be at the forefront of thinking in the big tech companies.",stuff.co.za,news,Stuff,,0.2078431372549019,448978019,1,https://stuff.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Smart-ring-basic.png,

Must it always be opposite day in Washington? Petroleum and gasoline prices are surging while the Obama Administration and its allies seem intent on making things worse. Instead of taking actions to increase supplies of petroleum and gasoline, the Administration pursues policies to restrict U.S. access to its own petroleum, ban imports of vast quantities of Canadian oil, and drive up costs of refining.

The fundamental law of supply and demand cannot be overridden by a veto. When supply increases, prices drop. When costs of production rise, supply decreases and prices rise. With these basics in mind, here are three suggestions for constraining gasoline prices and helping our economy.

1. Increase Drilling

First and foremost, drill. Yes, the petroleum market is a world market. No, ""drill, baby, drill"" is not a panacea. And it is true that the U.S. is not likely to eliminate all oil imports with even an aggressive drilling program. But more petroleum on the world market helps to hold prices in check.

Relatively small changes in supply can have large impacts on price, especially when markets are tight. And tight markets are what caused the petroleum price spikes of 2008 and will cause them again if production is shut down while demand from a growing world economy squeezes the spare capacity the world has enjoyed for the past couple of years.

The first and most obvious place to drill is where there are already drilling rigs and proven reserves -- such as the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the majority recommendation of its own scientific panel, the Obama Administration stopped virtually all new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. There have been recent signs that this policy might change. ""Might"" needs to be ""will,"" and soon.

The Chukchi Sea, off the Alaskan coast, is estimated to hold tens of billions of barrels of petroleum.[1] Bending to anti-energy pressure groups, the Obama Administration rescinded drilling permits that had already been issued on leases that had already been purchased -- hobbling energy production and killing desperately needed local jobs. Putting Chukchi Sea development back on track would increase the oil supply and rejuvenate the local economy.

The Administration should also move forward with responsible development of the fraction of 1 percent of the millions of acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. The government estimates that there are billions of barrels of petroleum within easy reach of the ready-to-go Alaska pipeline.[2]

Other offshore reserves are in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Exploration and development in these areas can be especially helpful in the long run.

2. Shelve ""Low-Carbon Fuel Standards""

The concept of ""low-carbon fuel standards"" is driving opposition to a petroleum pipeline from Canada. With its oil sands, Canada has more proven petroleum reserves than any country other than Saudi Arabia. A consistent ally and long-time friendly neighbor, Canada is exactly the sort of supplier the U.S. should want to fill the gap in the petroleum it cannot produce on its own. But some policymakers want to put these vast reserves off limits to American consumers.

All energy and fuels consume resources in their extraction, generation, and distribution. Some take more capital, some take more labor, and some take more energy to produce. Low-carbon standards focus arbitrarily on the generation costs. Further, ""low carbon"" is a misleading term. The carbon is the fuel. Low-carbon petroleum would be like decaffeinated No-Doz -- it would not work. A barrel of high-carbon petroleum from Canadian oil sands has pretty much the same carbon content as a barrel of low-carbon petroleum from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia -- or anywhere else, for that matter.

The Keystone XL pipeline would bring the U.S. over a million barrels of petroleum each day -- more than it imports from either Saudi Arabia or Venezuela (the U.S.'s two largest suppliers after Canada and Mexico). Along with the pipeline and petroleum would come increased energy security and a boost to the U.S. economy.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be applauded for her statements in support of the pipeline.[3] However, other components of the Administration, notably the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have taken steps to slow or stop the pipeline. Clinton's statements should be backed by an Administration commitment to overcome anti-energy delaying tactics and special-interest roadblocks.

3. Stop EPA Abuse of the Clean Air Act

The EPA's abuse of the Clean Air Act will drive up refining costs and, therefore, gasoline prices. Though the use of the act to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) would create large problems in many places, the EPA recently started the process to regulate CO2 emissions from refineries. This regulation goes beyond the gasoline reformulation mandates that balkanize gasoline markets with higher-cost boutique fuels.

The new CO2 regulation puts an additional burden on refiners' costs and subsequently raises prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil. Further, it will increase the amount of refined product the U.S. imports and reduce employment in an industry with wages that are more than 40 percent higher than the national average.

Because virtually every story on CO2 emissions has a picture of a smokestack emitting dark clouds of who knows what (usually steam with dramatic lighting), it is worth remembering that those dark clouds are not CO2. CO2 is a colorless, odorless, non-toxic gas. The claimed endangerment to human health comes from CO2's potential to warm the Earth. With full-blown cap and trade cutting emissions by more than 70 percent, the difference in world temperatures was projected to be an un-measurable thousandths of a degree by 2050 and no more than a couple of tenths of a degree at the end of the century. The world temperature impact of regulating refinery emissions would be even more trivial.

A Familiar Pattern

When petroleum and gasoline prices shot up during the energy crisis of the 1970s, the experts and pundits predicted imminent resource exhaustion, skyrocketing prices, and energy poverty. Instead, markets responded by searching for, discovering, and producing enough oil to provide over two decades of low prices. For instance, in the U.S. alone, the number of drilling rigs more than tripled between September 1973 (before the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent Arab oil embargo) and December 1981.

Now, imminent oil depletion and the futility of drilling are again supposedly on the horizon. However, increased drilling activity follows increased petroleum prices. Blunting this natural market response will drive up energy prices and reduce national income. This, plus the Keystone XL pipeline and scaling back EPA expansion of the Clean Air Act, would do much to stabilize gas prices and energy costs in general.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,David Kreutzer,-0.07450980392156858,448978008,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,

The Dutch government said in a statement Rutte's visit is to discuss ""bilateral and economic ties, and the situation in the Middle East"".

But also on the table at their meeting will be licencing policy for ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment to semiconductor manufacturers, whose tools have become a flashpoint in the US-China ""chip wars"".

ASML dominates the global market for lithography systems, multimillion dollar tools essential in helping to create the circuitry of computer chips.

One of Xi's top policy goals has been to help China build up its domestic chip-making industry, spending billions on subsidies.

Meanwhile the US government is seeking to undermine China's ability to make its own chips, and has enlisted aid from the Dutch and Japanese governments.

ASML has said that as of January 1, it no longer expects to receive licences from the Dutch government to ship its advanced ""DUV"" tool lines to Chinese customers.

But it remains unclear how much of the equipment ASML has already sold to Chinese customers -- more than €6bn worth last year alone -- it will be able to continue to service.

Sooner or later the company must seek licences for equipment already in China that now falls under Dutch or US export rules. If licences are denied, or revoked, ASML's tools would become impossible to operate within weeks -- potentially devastating for its customers, which include China's largest contract chipmaker SMIC.

ASML, which complies with all export regulations, declined comment on Friday.

""ASML has export licenses in place to service the majority of its Chinese customers until December 31, 2024,"" it said in an emailed answer to Reuters questions about machines that fall under the export restrictions earlier this week. It will then have to seek annual renewal licenses.

For some of its most advanced product lines ""ASML has not received an export license to continue servicing of these systems at some specific advanced logic fabs (in China) as of 1st November 2023,"" the company added.

China was ASML's second-largest market in 2023 behind Taiwan and ahead of South Korea, and it has said it expects to continue to have significant sales in China this year of product lines used to make relatively older chips, which do not fall under the current restrictions.

During the March 26-27 visit, Rutte is expected to meet Xi and premier Li Qiang. Dutch Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen is also attending and expected to meet Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao.

Apple is reportedly planning to upgrade the iPhone 16 with increased RAM and storage capabilities, a move driven by the growing requirements of on-device artificial intelligence (AI).

Speculation until late December suggested that Apple's upcoming devices would retain the RAM specifications of their predecessors, with 6GB for the standard and Plus models, and 8GB for the Pro versions.

However, the evolving landscape of AI technology, which now includes complex image generation and assistant functions, has led to predictions of a future need for up to 20GB of RAM in smartphones.

Leaker @Tech_Reve recently highlighted a report from a Korean securities firm indicating that the iPhone 16 will indeed feature enhanced RAM to support the intensive demands of on-device AI.

In addition to RAM upgrades, Apple is considering expanding the baseline storage to 256GB for its new phones.

This adjustment is anticipated due to AI models requiring access to vast amounts of data from device interactions, camera inputs, and sensor information, necessitating increased storage capacity for optimal functionality.

It's plausible that Apple may opt to boost both the storage and RAM in the iPhone 16, standardizing 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage across the range.

This would align with industry trends, as seen with Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra which recently upped its base RAM to 12GB, and the Google Pixel 8 Pro, which launched with more RAM than its predecessor.

However, the necessity of these upgrades is under debate, especially with many of the AI features in competitors' devices being cloud-powered.

Apple is reportedly exploring partnerships with AI giants such as ChatGPT's OpenAI, Google, and Baidu to integrate advanced AI features into the iPhone 16. This collaboration could indicate a reliance on cloud-based processing for AI tasks, potentially reducing the immediate need for increased RAM and storage on the device itself.

With the advancement of on-device AI technologies, Apple recognizes the need for more powerful hardware to efficiently run AI-driven features. These include image generation and intelligent assistant functions, which demand significant memory and storage capacity.

Rumors suggest that the iPhone 16 might standardize at 8GB of RAM across all models, with a minimum storage capacity of 256GB. This would mark a significant increase from previous generations, aimed at accommodating the data-intensive requirements of AI applications.

Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra has recently increased its base RAM to 12GB, and the Google Pixel 8 Pro launched with more RAM than its predecessor. Apple's rumored upgrades for the iPhone 16 appear to follow this industry trend, enhancing the device's competitiveness in the market.

While many AI features in competitor devices rely on cloud processing, Apple's potential collaborations with AI powerhouses could bring similar capabilities to the iPhone 16. However, increased RAM and storage would still benefit users by ensuring smoother operation of on-device tasks and offline functionality.

Engaging with leading AI firms like OpenAI, Google, and Baidu could signal Apple's commitment to integrating cutting-edge AI features into the iPhone 16. These partnerships might help Apple catch up in the AI space, offering users innovative functionalities powered by both device hardware and cloud services.

In recent weeks the 87-year-old pope has been suffering on and off from bronchitis and influenza and has delegated an aide to read his addresses for him, but on Sunday his prepared text was not read at all.

It is very unusual for a pope to totally skip a homily at a major event such as Palm Sunday, which marks the start of Holy Week, a busy period leading to Easter. The Vatican gave no immediate explanation for why the pope skipped the homily. Vatican Television coverage showed only the crowd for a few minutes, instead of a close-up of the pope.

An announcer on Vatican Radio then said the pope had decided to not read the homily. The pope, dressed in red vestments, continued presiding, reading parts of the Mass. Cardinals, priests and bishops took part in the service that commemorates what the Bible says was Jesus' entry into Jerusalem days before he was betrayed, put on trial and executed by crucifixion.

The clerics, along with participants in a crowd estimated by Vatican police at about 60,000 people, held palm fronds and olive branches at the service. Francis has a knee ailment and for more than a year he has presided at Masses while sitting near the altar while a cardinal acts as the main celebrant.

After the Mass, Francis delivered his weekly Sunday Angelus message and blessing from the altar and not from the window of the Apostolic Palace overlooking the square. That is not unusual on major occasions. In the prayer, he condemned the shooting attack that killed at least 133 people at a concert hall near Moscow as a vile and inhuman act that offends God.

He again asked for prayers for all those suffering from wars, mentioning Ukraine and Gaza. At the end of the service, Francis was driven around the square in an open-top vehicle. He waved and smiled at people in the crowd and did not appear to be any difficulty.

In a major jolt to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a trial court on Friday granted six days custody of Party's national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the alleged irregularities Delhi Liquor Policy Case.

The ED has so far arrested former deputy Delhi CM Manish Sisodia, AAP leader Sanjay Singh, BRS leader and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao daughter K Kavitha in the case. Here's a breakdown of ED's charges against the arrested leaders and the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam.

What Is Delhi Liquor Policy Case?

The ED has alleged that the now scrapped new excise policy was implemented by the AAP leaders as part of a conspiracy to give wholesale business profit of 12% to certain private companies in alchohol business.

In July 2022, the Delhi Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar submitted a report to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) Vinai Kumar Saxena about the alleged procedural lapses in the formulation of the now scrapped Delhi Excise policy.

Kumar in his report to the Delhi LG said that arbitrary and unilateral decisions taken by Manish Sisodia as the Excise Minister in Delhi had caused financial losses of more that Rs 580 crore to the exchequer.

The report also alleged that AAP government and leaders in Delhi got kickbacks from owners and operators of alchohol business in exchange for discounts, extention is licence fee, waiver on penalties and relief due to Covid-19 pandemic,etc. Kumar further alleged that that these kickbakcs were used to influence the Assembly election in Punjab and Goa.

The LG gave this report to the CBI and ordered enquiry. Following which Sisodia was arrested after the CBI named Sisodia and 14 others accused in its FIR.

According to the ED, in the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam, wholesale liquor business was given to private entities. Under this new excise policy a 12% margin was fixed, for a 6% kickback. The ED alleged that the policy was formulated with deliberate loopholes which promoted cartel formations through the back door to benefit AAP leaders.

According to ED, AAP leaders got kickbacks to the tune of Rs 100 crore from the ""South Group"" linked to K Kavitha.

While arguing against Sisodia's bail in the Supreme Court, ASG SV Raju appearing for ED had said that the sudden and unexplained increase of the wholesalers' profit margin under the excise policy from 5% to 12% caused massive losses to not only the public exchequer but also the consumers. The ED is also considering this additional profit margin as proceeds of crime, Raju had then told the top court.

Arvind Kejriwal's Role In Delhi Liquor Policy According To ED

The ED has arrested Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal under Section 19 of PMLA. The ED has submitted in the court that Kejriwal has been intrinsically involved in the entire conspiracy of the Delhi Liquor Policy scam wherein certain private persons were favoured and benefitted in a quid pro quo of receiving kickbacks.

The remand noted by ED says ""due to actions of Sh Arvind Kejriwal involving excise policy formulation, hatching the conspiracy of kickbacks with the South Group members, and eventually using part of the proceeds of crime generated out of this scheduled offence in the election campaign of AAP for the Goa Assembly elections, it is clear that all these activities were not only done with his knowledge but also his active collusion.

The ED has contended that Arvind Kejriwal who is the ultimate incharge of the AAP and was intrinsically involved in the acts of policy formulation, kickback scheme and the final use of the proceeds of crime thus generated including conspiracy thereof.

The ED has alleged that Kejriwal is also liable for use of Proceeds of Crime of Rs 45 crore in the election of the AAP in Goa under section 70(1) of PMLA apart from his role in his personal capacity.

""Kejriwal has conspired with other persons and actively involved in formation of policy for facilitating taking of kickbacks and has played a role in generation, use and concealment of the proceeds of crime,"" according to ED.

ED says that as per investigations done so far, the proceeds of crime of about 45 crore which were received as bribe from south group were used in Goa election by AAP.

ED has held Kejriwal guilty under section 3 of PMLA for commission of offence of money laundering and for actively involved in the process and activities connected with the proceeds of crime and thus liable to be arrested under Section 19 of PMLA.

ED's Case Against Manish Sisodia In Delhi Liquor Policy

The CBI arrested Sisodia in connection with the alleged scam in the new excise policy on February 26, 2023. He was sent to ED's custody on March 9. CBI alleged that Sisodia was instrumental in recommending and taking decisions regarding the new liquor policy, without taking approval of competent authority with an intention to extend undue favours to the licensee post tender.

Whereas, the ED has alleged that the new excise policy was implemented as part of a conspiracy to give wholesale business profit of 12% to certain private companies. It says that such a provision was not mentioned in the minutes of meetings of the Group of Ministers (GoM) and were later added by AAP leaders.

ED claims that Vijay Nair (another co-accused) along with others conspired along with South Group to give extraordinary profit margins to wholesalers in the new policy. According to ED, Nair acted on behalf of Kejriwal and deputy Sisodia.

""This policy was being drafted considering the favours to be granted to the South Group and was formed in collusion with Vijay Nair, Manish Sisodia and other members of South Group,"" ED says in Kejriwal's remand note.

According to ED, Sisodia's Secretary C Arvind has revealed that Sisodia called him to Kejriwal's residence and handed over a 30 page document that was the GoM report for the new policy.

""In that document it was mentioned that the wholesale licence should be given to agents (private players) of manufacturers, one wholesale license can be a distributor of any number of manufacturers and the wholesale profit margin was fixed at 12 %. These points were never discusses in the GoM meeting that formulated the now scrapped new Excise Policy for Delhi according to ED.

K Kavitha's Role In Delhi Liquor Policy Case

A former MP and BRS leader Kavitha who is also the daughter of former Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was arrested last week for being part of the 'South Group'.

The ED claims that the South Group got uninhibited access, undue favours, and secured stakes in established wholesale businesses and multiple retail zones (over and above what was allowed in the policy).

According to ED, partners of this South Group were given a 65% stake in Indospirit in collusion with its owner Sameer Mahendru (another accused in this case). This was allegedly done to recover kickbacks given by the South Group.

Raghav Magunta, P Sarath Chandra Reddy who is also co-founder of Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma are also said to be partners in the South Group according to ED.

Buchi Babu who was CA to K Kavitha has revealed to the ED that Arun Pillai was working with Vijay Nair in policy formulation and Nair was offering provision for favouring K Kavitha. Nair worked with Sisodia and Kejriwal for the same, says ED's remand note in court.

The ED says that this has been corroborated by WhatsApp messages retrieved from Buchi Babu, wherein certain provisions of the Excise policy were found two days before it was notified. According to Babu's statement Nair sent these provisions to him and Arun Pillai.

ED's Allegations Against Sanjay Singh In Delhi Liquor Policy Case

According to ED's submission in high court, Sanjay Singh is a ""key conspirator"" in the alleged Delhi Liquor Policy scam. Ha has been accused of being closely associated with Dinesh Arora and Amit Arora (others accused in th scam.)

While replying to Sanjay Singh's bail plea in the Delhi High Court, the ED said that Singh was involved in creating a special purpose vehicle called M/s Aralias Hospitality Pvt Ltd to launder the ""proceeds of crime"" that would have been generated from the business arising out of the Delhi liquor policy.

Singh has been accused of acquiring, possessing, concealing, dissipating and using proceeds of crime generated from the alleged loopholes in now scrapped Delhi liquor policy. So according to ED, AAP leaders conspired to make the new excise policy, in order to receive kickbacks from liquor wholesalers and manufacturers.

ED also allegedly found ""confidential documents"" relating to the investigation of the Delhi Liquor policy case during the search conducted on Singh's premises on October 4, 2023.",news.abplive.com,news,english,Nupur Dogra,-0.07450980392156858,448977005,1,https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/03/24/c6a4bf67276433f381999b9c1ab90d221711279778669934_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640,eng-9419785

In her speech, she highlighted that China is in a new era of high-quality growth and will continue to be a key contributor to global economic growth. She emphasized that international cooperation is essential to solve the challenges the world is facing.

Calibrating monetary and fiscal policies

On the global economy, she said that 2024 requires careful calibration of monetary and fiscal policies to secure a soft landing. Many central banks are facing the difficult task of deciding when to cut interest rates and by how much based. Fiscal authorities in most countries are also facing the challenges of embracing consolidation to reduce debt, rebuilding buffers and financing the digital and green transformations of their economies. She said that, compared with the past several years, the global economy has proven to be remarkable resilient. IMF projects over 3 percent growth for 2024 and the following year for the global economy. Looking to the medium term, IMF expects global growth to be around 3 percent. She said that low productivity growth and high debt levels are posing challenges to all, especially to emerging and developing economies. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are affecting trade and capital flows. Hopefully, the digital and green transformations will present opportunities to boost productivity and improve living standards. Deep structural reforms can enhance the conditions for entrepreneurship, innovation and economic performance.

At the forefront

On China's high-quality growth, IMF said that China could grow considerably faster with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms starting with sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and the additional growth would add $3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy. The IMF head outlined that China has significantly improved its living standards and China's social security system covers more people than any other country on the planet.

On the artificial intelligence front, she said that China is at the forefront of emerging economies in terms of AI preparedness. China's well-developed digital infrastructure provides a head start.

In terms of advancing the green economy, she described China as a global leader in deploying renewable energy with enormous potential, adding that China was making rapid progress in green mobility.

""China's remarkable development success has delivered tremendous benefits to hundreds of millions of people,"" she said.

She praised China's decision to pursue high-quality development and China's continued support for IMF, expressing that the IMF was committed to work together with China to tackle global challenges via policy dialogue.

Prosperous future for all

""We have an outsized impact on the most vulnerable members of our global community,"" she said, highlighting the importance of international cooperation once more in her speech. Specifically, China has shown its remarkable leadership in making contributions to help strengthen the IMF's financial capacity in areas of IMF's concessional lending instrument for low-income countries, resilience and sustainability facility, the facility provides affordable long-term financing to countries undertaking reforms to reduce risks to prospective balance of payments stability, including those related to climate change and pandemic preparedness, and capacity-development initiatives.

""We also recognize China's important role in addressing debt distress in emerging and developing economies,"" she said.

Georgieva is confident that China and the world can tackle the challenges we are facing and can create a more prosperous future for all through cooperation.

Chief Executive Officer of the Independent Power Generators Ghana (IPGG), Dr Elikplim Kwabla Apetorgbor made the assertion via a statement on March 23, 2024 which sought to blame the VRA for the current power outages across the country.

But in a rebuttal issued by the VRA on Sunday March 24, 2024, it dismissed the claims as erroneous and misleading.

""The VRA wishes to state that since 1972, the Authority has been supplying power to neighbouring countries without reneging on its mandate to deliver reliable and affordable power to Ghana; and this the Authority continues to do,"" the statement read.

""Also, it is important to mention that the allocation of the power generated from the Akosombo and Kpong hydropower stations is supervised by the Electricity Market Oversight Panel (EMOP) and not the VRA. By this arrangement, the allocation always prioritizes the Ghana market, in accordance with government policies to ensure long-term optimization of the nation's hydro resources,"" it added.

The VRA however assured the general public and all other stakeholders that it will continue to prioritize electricity supply to the Ghana market in line with its mandate, government policies and regulatory obligations.

Israel accepted the proposal put forward by CIA Director Bill Burns, according to Ravid. Burns was in Doha, Qatar, where Hamas and Israel are engaged in talks through mediators.

Delegations are now awaiting a response from Hamas, Ravid said.

A diplomatic source briefed on the matter confirmed to CNN the accuracy of the information but said issues remain unanswered, including the entry of aid and Israeli military repositioning in Gaza.

CNN contacted Israeli officials and Hamas about the status of negotiations.

It is unclear what changes have been made to the number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas' latest proposal this month demanded the release of 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel then called these demands ridiculous and absurd.

A deal, if it materializes, is expected to have several phases. Initially, Hamas offered to release the female hostages, including elderly, sick and injured Israeli soldiers. This number would be around 40 out of the hundred or so hostages still alive.

Mossad Director David Barnea, along with a high-level Israeli security delegation, visited Doha twice this week for talks.

Behind the intellectual identity and multiculturalism of this city lies its close relationship with the West thanks to exports. In the history of the city, in its mortar; It would be appropriate to open an export museum in order to show exports, which are an important building block, to both new generations and foreign buyers visiting our city.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY

CHP Chairman Özgür Özel said, ""Turkey's export-import coverage ratio in 2023 remained at 70,7 percent, but the Aegean Region's export-import coverage ratio was 203 percent. If Türkiye were like Izmir, its problems would be solved. We will attach great importance to sustainability in Izmir.

At a time when the world is talking about industry 5.0, as CHP, we will read this change correctly and realize the concept of labor 5.0 with all our stakeholders.

The property in question is located in Rhebogue on the outskirts of the campus and is the latest example of UL significantly overpaying for a property in the city.

UL purchased the old Dunnes Stores building in Limerick City for €8.3m in 2019, even though it had been valued at €3m just two years previously. It is now worth just €5.4m.

Furthermore, it recently emerged that the 20-house scheme in Rhebogue was in use without the proper planning permission for student residences. The university said it was engaging with Limerick City and County Council on the matter.

This development was originally valued at just over €11.4m, but a review found this to have been inflated and it was only worth around €6.2m.

Ms Mey told staff: ""The university will have to absorb the resulting draft impairment, a sum in the region of €5.2m, in our financial accounts.

""This, coupled with the impairment arising from the purchase of the city centre campus, of which I have already advised you, will result in our financial year end position ending in deficit - when a surplus had previously been anticipated."" She said that this will be funded from the university's financial reserves.

Furthermore, Ms Mey said a full review would explain the compliance, decision-making process and governance of the key aspects of the transaction.

""I am aware that there is frustration and anger among staff members that this has happened so soon after the issues that arose in relation to the city centre campus,"" she said.

(NASDAQ:PAYX)?","Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has had a rough month with its share price down 3.0%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Paychex's ROE.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

Check out our latest analysis for Paychex

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:

46% = US$1.6b ÷ US$3.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.46 in profit.

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

Firstly, we acknowledge that Paychex has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 10% net income growth seen by Paychex over the past five years.

Next, on comparing Paychex's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It's important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is PAYX worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether PAYX is currently mispriced by the market.

While Paychex has a three-year median payout ratio of 76% (which means it retains 24% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.

Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 44%.

In total, we are pretty happy with Paychex's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The resource-poor country bred its heavy chemical industry to strengthen its export power and turned into an IT powerhouse through semiconductor and IT equipment prowess. The government-led industry growth model came under challenge upon the rise of the so-called Washington Consensus based on free trade and the market in the 1990s.

Then came the rise of China, which made the U.S. pivot more inwards to lessen China's influence and strengthen its own manufacturing capacity instead of relying on outside sourcing. The role of the World Trade Organization as the referee in global commerce was watered down. Due to the significance of chips in the digitalized world, the fight over influence in chip supplies and sovereignty in chipmaking has become intense. The U.S. government is subsidizing $19.5 billion for the construction and modernization of Intel's chip facility. The U.S. chip company will be taking nearly a third of the $52.7 billion federal subsidy for chip industry under the CHIPS and Science Act, doubling the $6 billion for Samsung Electronics and the $5 billion for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in return for their construction of chip facilities in America. The discrepancy places the Asian players at disadvantageous position.

The Yoon Suk Yeol administration has been trying hard to bolster the country's chip competitiveness, but it lags far behind its competitors. The temporary tax break for chip facility investment matured late last year and the so-called K-CHIPS Act to provide incentives for chip investment also end this year. The governing People Power Party vows a stronger revision to the K-CHIPS Act and the opposition Democratic Party also promises to extend the cut in corporate income tax on large companies' investments in chips and other strategic technologies ahead of the April parliamentary elections.

These tragic events underscored the immense power of technology and its potential to shape the destiny of nations and civilizations. As we reflect on the lessons of the past, it becomes evident that the responsible development and deployment of technology are paramount to ensuring a prosperous and sustainable future for humanity.

Indeed, the transformative power of technology extends far beyond geopolitical conflicts; it permeates every aspect of our lives, from healthcare and education to commerce and communication. With advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, technology has the potential to revolutionize industries, drive economic growth, and improve the quality of life for billions of people around the globe.

However, amidst the promise of technological innovation, we must also confront the inherent risks and challenges it poses to society. The rise of automation and robotics, for example, threatens to disrupt traditional employment models and exacerbate income inequality. Moreover, the proliferation of digital technologies has given rise to new forms of cyber threats and privacy concerns, raising questions about data security and personal freedoms in the digital age.

As we navigate the complex terrain of technological progress, we must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing these challenges. This requires a concerted effort from governments, businesses, and civil society to establish robust regulatory frameworks, ethical guidelines, and safeguards to protect against the potential risks of technology.

Furthermore, emerging economies like Nigeria need to seize the opportunities afforded by technology to leapfrog into the digital age and position themselves at the forefront of innovation and development. By investing in STEM education, nurturing a culture of entrepreneurship, and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and government, Nigeria can unlock its vast potential and become a global leader in technology and innovation.

The remarkable ascendancy of Indian executives to the helm of global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Adobe underscores the profound influence of high-quality education, unyielding ambition, and steadfast perseverance. This narrative serves not only as a beacon of hope but also as a strategic blueprint for Nigeria. It illuminates a path towards technological supremacy and socio-economic transformation, embodying the essence of ""brute forcing"" - a tenacious resolve to surmount challenges and seize success. This spirit is a clarion call for Africans to forge their destiny in the digital era and contribute to a legacy of innovation and prosperity for future generations.

To catalyze this transformation, a bold and aggressive STEM policy is paramount. Such a policy must aim to expose more Nigerians to world-class education and the forefront of the global IT corporate landscape. However, entry into these elite circles is merely the beginning. It is imperative for those who succeed to uphold a tradition of altruism, continually paving the way for fellow Nigerians. This ethos of mutual upliftment and shared success will enhance Nigeria's stature in the international arena and sow the seeds of long-term national development.

Imagine, in the forthcoming decades, an IT corporate world enriched by a substantial contingent of Nigerian professionals. This vision could redefine Nigeria's role from a peripheral participant to a central figure in global technological innovation. The strategic moves by industry behemoths like Foxconn and Apple, such as establishing new factories in India, highlight the critical role of a skilled IT workforce in attracting international investment and fostering industrial growth. Nigeria, by nurturing its human capital, can secure a seat at the table of global tech leadership, averting the risk of being marginalized as merely a consumer market for foreign innovations.

Also, the acceleration of technological advancement extends beyond economic and societal realms, touching upon the critical issues of environmental sustainability and resource management. Emerging technologies like renewable energy sources, smart grids, and precision agriculture offer promising solutions to combat climate change, conserve precious resources, and ensure ecological balance. By embracing these innovations, African nations can spearhead a transition towards a development model that is both sustainable and inclusive, thereby contributing to the global fight against environmental degradation and championing the cause of green technology.

This comprehensive approach, rooted in education, cooperation, and technological innovation, represents a forward-thinking strategy for Nigeria and Africa at large. It promises not only to elevate the continent's stature on the global stage but also to ensure a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable future for all its inhabitants.

Moreover, technology can democratize access to information and empower marginalized communities. With the proliferation of mobile devices and internet connectivity, individuals across Africa can now access educational resources, healthcare services, and economic opportunities like never before. By leveraging technology to bridge the digital divide and empower grassroots initiatives, Africa can unlock the full potential of its human capital and drive inclusive growth and development.

However, the realization of these opportunities hinges on overcoming persistent barriers such as infrastructure limitations, digital literacy gaps, and regulatory challenges. Governments, industry leaders, and civil society must work collaboratively to address these challenges and create an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship to thrive.

The ethical implications of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and autonomous systems cannot be overlooked. As we embrace the potential of these transformative technologies, we must also grapple with complex ethical questions surrounding privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. It is essential to develop robust ethical frameworks and regulatory mechanisms to ensure that technological advancements are aligned with societal values and contribute to the common good.

Ultimately, the journey towards technological leadership requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses education, innovation, and inclusive policymaking. By fostering a culture of innovation, investing in human capital, and nurturing an ecosystem that fosters collaboration and creativity, Africa can position itself as a global hub for technological innovation and entrepreneurship.

In conclusion, the future of work and society in Africa, particularly in Nigeria, is intricately linked to the trajectory of technological advancement. By embracing the opportunities presented by technology and addressing the challenges it poses, Africa can unlock its full potential and chart a course towards a prosperous, sustainable, and inclusive future. Through collective action and visionary leadership, Africa can harness the power of technology to overcome obstacles, drive economic growth, and improve the lives of millions across the continent.

However, the token's value has increased by more than 1.5% in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, MATIC is trading at $0.9874 with a market value of over 9.7 billion dollars, making it the 16th largest cryptocurrency. The highly volatile price movement of MATIC continues to be a topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency space, which is also evident from its consistently high social volume. Despite this, the weighted sentiment for MATIC has shifted into negative territory.

This could mean that a bearish trend is prevailing in the market. An analysis of MATIC's daily chart shows that the MACD indicates a clear bearish trend, suggesting that the downtrend could persist. Polygon's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has recorded a sharp decline, indicating a high probability of a price drop at the time of writing. However, MATIC's price has rebounded from the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands.

Network Issues with MATIC

The mentioned situation could be a sign of an upcoming bull rally. While MATIC's price movement remains volatile, the L2 zkEVM recently encountered an issue. According to an official tweet, the zkEVM Mainnet Beta faced a problem with its sequencer due to a restructuring on L1.

The issue affected only the Polygon zkEVM and did not impact the PoS blockchain, Polygon CDK, or any chains deployed using Polygon CDK. Data shows that the daily active addresses of L2 have dropped after a sharp increase, which also negatively affected its daily transactions since March 21st.

ANZ's commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari say iron ore should trade between US$90-110/t for the remainder of 2024, levels that would keep iron ore profits relatively safe even as China's real estate sector continues to stumble.

They say there's no solution on the horizon for China's property issues, expecting steel demand from its real estate sector to continue falling this year.

That's a big deal since Chinese demand sets iron ore prices. It controls almost 60% of the 1.8Btpa crude steel market and consumes around four-fifths of the seaborne iron ore trade.

But other sectors of the economy will come to the rescue, and Hynes and Kumari also think expensive Chinese magnetite producers will continue to set the marginal cost line.

""Investment in social housing should increase. Infrastructure investment remains strong, bolstered by government efforts to build out the country's renewable energy sector,"" they said.

""China's automotive industry, the largest in the world, will receive further supportive measures, with particular focus on the electric vehicle (EV) market. The manufacturing, machinery and shipping industries are also seeing growth.

""Together, these areas of growth should lift China's steel consumption by 0.5% in 2024.

""Combined with low supply growth, the iron ore market should be relatively balanced. With a large portion of Chinese domestic supply produced at costs higher than USD100/t, we see the current price as a floor. Ultimately, we expect iron ore to trade in a USD90-110/t range for the remainder of the year.""

Iron ore briefly dipped below US$100/t early last week before rebounding sharply to as much as US$109/t before Singapore futures fell 2.9% to US$106.60/t on Friday afternoon.

With prices around current levels there may be some iron ore companies in a spot of bother, though that only includes those with extremely high cost structures.

The majors BHP (ASX:BHP), Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO) and Fortescue (ASX:FMG) all produce their main hematite DSO products for around US$20/t.

That means even with grade discounts they're well ahead, issuing strong dividends.

Rio paid out 60% of its earnings for the last financial year to shareholders, with FMG paying 65% and BHP 69% at their half year results. In dollar terms it came in at a combined splash of $15.2b, enough to buy investors 21 controversial Tasmanian football stadiums.

The biggest threat to payouts at current price levels will come from decarbonisation and capex spend as well as divisions external to iron ore.

Think FMG's green energy business, BHP's lossmaking nickel assets and Rio's aluminium segment.

As a benchmark, FMG was paying at the top of its 50-80% range when its dividends peaked with iron ore prices in FY21.

Average iron ore prices received by miners last year weren't too far off current levels. Rio reported an average FOB Platts 62% fe index of US$110.3/t in 2023. Its own product realised US$99.7/wmt FOB, equal to US$108.4/dmt once a moisture content of 8% is factored in.

At the smaller end of the spectrum, Fenix Resources (ASX:FEX) had C1 costs of US$50/wmt in the December half and generated strong margins due to hedges and grade premiums.

Mineral Resources (ASX:MIN) expects its Yilgarn and Utah Point hubs to produce at an equivalent top end of US$70/wmt and US$50/wmt respectively, but expects to begin exports from the 35Mtpa Onslow hub by June, which will operate at lower cost levels of around US$21/t once fully ramped.

Mt Gibson Iron (ASX:MGX), which also gets grade premiums from its Koolan Island mine, has costs in the US$45/t range. Tassie miner Grange Resources (ASX:GRR) is sitting higher at around US$85/t and has a longer haulage route than WA producers, but achieves the strongest premiums of the listed Aussie producers for its magnetite pellets and concentrate.

Champion Iron (ASX:CIA), which has doubled the capacity of its Bloom Lake mine in Canada to 15Mtpa and wants to convert at least half its production to an ultra-premium DR grade 69% Fe product, has higher costs than the Pilbara cohort at around US$60/t but would sit on stronger margins once it completes the US$350m project with Goldman Sachs analysts estimating a US$75/t premium for the top of the range iron ore.

DR pellets have averaged premiums of US$70/t in the past three years, though weak steel mill margins have hurt that advantage as factories trim costs by shifting to lower grades.

Around 50% of its current sales are to China at US$25-30/t freight rates, well above their Pilbara counterparts, though it could save US$5-8/t according to GS' Paul Young and Caleb Heiner by selling to DR plants in the Middle East and Europe where low carbon steel technologies are grabbing a larger market share.

There remain downside risks, Hynes and Kumari caution.

""China's efforts to cut emissions may put pressure on heavy industry. China's steel industry produces 18% of the country's carbon emissions, so we expect it to continue increasing its use of electric arc furnaces for production. This process uses significantly less energy. However, the use of steel scrap means subsequently less demand for iron ore,"" they said.

""This process won't have a dramatic impact on emissions in the short term. Ultimately output curbs will be required to meet the emissions targets under the current five-year plan. This could significantly impact demand for iron ore, with prices likely to pressure the lower end of our expected trading range should the output curbs be substantial.""

That sort of policy, normally carried out unofficially via local directives, never really came to bear last year, pushing prices up to super high levels of more than US$140/t in December.

ANZ sees the Chinese real estate sector's steel consumption crumbling by 4% to 270Mt in 2024, with the 3.6 year timeframe to offload every unpurchased property in the country over 1.5x the 2.3 year peak from the start of the 2014-2015 downturn.

But they're bullish price support will come from infrastructure and non-traditional sources like electric vehicles, showing the new energy boom is not just a lithium story.

""Steel consumption from government-backed infrastructure projects will continue to grow but at a slower pace, due to local government deleveraging following the NPC's work report's requirement for them to address debt levels,"" Hynes and Kumari said.

""However, broader investment in the infrastructure sector is more than offsetting that slowdown. We expect steel demand from the energy sector to grow 8-10% in 2024.""

The auto sector accounts for around 10% of Chinese steel consumption, with 900kg in each new vehicle on average.

""Beijing has pledged to boost domestic spending on EVs via trade-in programs and the revision of local policies that restrict the purchase of cars,"" Hynes and Kumari said.

""Advanced high-strength steel has become an important part of EV construction. New steel grades have high strength-to-weight ratios, making them ideal for applications such as battery enclosures. Other materials, such as aluminium, may be lighter but don't offer the same strength and durability. The main components of a vehicle's structure are often made from steel.

""Chinese car makers produced 30.16m units last year (up 11.6% y/y), breaking the previous record of 29m units in 2017. The rapid expansion of the EV sector is likely to keep that growth high. After a period of weakness in mid-2023, passenger car sales in China grew in the last three months of the year. All up, we remain positive about China's automotive sector and expect to see steel demand growth from this sector in double digits.""

Supply growth is expected to be muted, with just 1% growth in seaborne exports expected in 2024, though future years could see a big lift in supply from Africa where Rio and its Chinese JV partners expect to open Guinea's up-to-120Mtpa Simandou mines by the end of next year.

Distributors are in the middle of that change. While preparing for a switch to equipment that uses lower-GWP refrigerants, and figuring out their place in the decarbonization movement, distributors are also employing AI in their work -- or planning to do so -- adjusting to market shifts, and coping with a multitude of other forces shaping the industry.

Earlier this year, Distribution Trends reached out via email to executives at four distributors to gather their thoughts on some of these changes.

Participating in the 2024 Distributors Roundtable were David Kesterton, president of Mingledorff's, based in Peachtree Corners, Georgia; Terry Tarantine, vice president of sales at Young Supply Co. in Chesterfield Township, Michigan; Sid Harvey, president of Sid Harvey Industries Inc. of Garden City, New York; and Doug Young, CEO of Behler-Young Co., based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

How much is the transition to A2L refrigerants affecting your organization, in terms of the equipment you're planning to stock and also in terms of the availability of refrigerants (if you carry them)?

Kesterton: Honestly, the transition is just beginning. We've been reviewing the transition plan with our major supplier and communicating specific product family/model plans with our clients over the past few months. ...

We will continue to roll out and review the plans during the course of the year (Zoom/in-person) in addition to conducting technical service and installation training meetings on a continuous basis.

Tarantine: We are planning to sell R-410A for as long as possible. Contractors have shown a history of selling existing technologies for as long as possible. Additionally, there is a general fear of higher pricing and A2L hesitancy on the part of end users.

Harvey: We plan to stock the equipment that our customers request. We will have an overlap of HFC equipment and A2L equipment but do not foresee any issues. The A2L refrigerants are currently available. We have been selling A2Ls for refrigeration purposes for a few years now and are already stocking R-32 and R-454B.

Young: It is certainly an area of extreme focus for our team. The timing of eliminating the 410A products and the introduction of the 454B products is very strategic. If not done properly, there are many negative ramifications. In many ways, we are at the mercy of the manufacturer. If they have a good plan and we have a good plan, we all win with a seamless transition.

Thank goodness for the coalition of AHRI, HARDI, and others that have been able to work with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for the additional year of sell-through of 410A product. If that was not accomplished, there could have been very serious problems throughout the industry, from supply in manufacturing to lost inventory value in distribution.

How are you collaborating with contractor customers so that you and they are ready for the A2L transition?

Kesterton: Again, like I mentioned, there is a good deal of education regarding installation and service that will take place during the 2024 year. Although A2L is different, it's not our first rodeo, so to speak. I think the most difficult part of the transition compared to R-410 is the compressed timeline. We introduced R-410 (Puron) in 1998 with a transition date of 2010. This one is much more compressed.

Tarantine: We have already started training on the EPA and DOE (Department of Energy) regulatory landscape. Refrigeration will be more significantly impacted than HVAC, and we are running training sessions currently.

Harvey: Our sales team speaks to our customers often about the transition, and the feedback we get helps us prepare for the changes. We hold in-house training for our employees and for contractors on the transition, which will help smooth the process.

Young: Our equipment manufacturer developed online training for our dealer network to take at their leisure. On top of that, we are holding regional update meetings partnered with a vendor that sells tools impacted by the A2L change. And lastly, we will dedicate a breakout session to all things A2L in our annual dealer meeting.

Decarbonization and electrification are trends in the industry. Did you sell more heat pumps in 2023 than in other recent years?

Kesterton: Yes, and we have been trending towards more heat pumps for really the past decade-plus.

Tarantine: Yes. We have been very active with heat pumps, especially when it comes to multi-family and larger building renovations. We are still struggling to get our dealers to propose hybrid systems, but we believe we will be moving more going forward.

Harvey: Heat pumps have been a part of our business for many years now. We have seen an uptick in sales almost every year, and we believe this trend will continue as new legislation is passed.

Young: The northern market has never embraced the heat pump philosophy and continues to struggle moving it forward. Our increase is small and insignificant in the big picture. To put a number on it, less than a 50-unit increase for 2023.

Ductless applications are still strong but not necessarily as a primary source of comfort. These applications are ancillary to traditional forced-air products.

How about high-efficiency equipment, such as condensing furnaces? How have sales in 2023 compared to those in the recent past?

Kesterton: Condensing furnace sales have increased, but because of our location and minimal heating hours, 80% furnaces and high-efficiency heat pumps have been the systems of choice.

Tarantine: Our ratio of high-efficiency furnaces to 80% has been growing every year for over a decade.

Harvey: The geographic areas that offer the contractor and/or end-user incentives to install energy-efficient equipment are where we have seen the most growth in high-efficiency units. When the incentives are substantial it can really influence the buying habits in those states.

Young: Ironically, even with the decrease in 2023 unit sales, our high-efficiency furnaces remain at the same percentage of overall furnace sales as the prior year. That percentage has remained reasonably consistent year over year over year. We have seen no sharp increases or decreases.

There's been more discussion lately about applying artificial intelligence and automation to HVACR wholesaling. What is your view of how these kinds of technological advances can be used in distribution?

Kesterton: Well, I think there will be many applications in the future for AI. Advances in system diagnosis will be much more prevalent in the coming years. That is a huge benefit for the consumer, distributor, and contractor in the future. Today, while BOTs are rules-based decision-making, as opposed to AI (adapt and learn), we have been using them for years. Some common applications are expediting credit approvals, and inventory distribution center remixing BOTs.

Tarantine: We are just starting to see AI entering our industry but as will all businesses, it's coming and will dramatically alter how we manage information when it gets here and I believe it will be sooner rather than later.

Harvey: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing distribution in many organizations and will continue to do so. AI will be able to quickly recognize market trends, help to optimize inventory, and perform simple customer service tasks to provide even faster response times.

Young: We believe there are plenty of opportunities. We already use artificial intelligence in some of our firewall and cyber threat protections already. We are very close to selecting an emerging software provider to use this type of intelligence in optimizing our inventory and the management practices that go along with that (demand, balances, minimum/maximum, transfers, etc).

We also see opportunity in the pricing and sales and marketing areas. There is opportunity if you open your mind to what needs to get better. From an automation perspective, newer and emerging technologies and their reasonable cost entry points have allowed us to address our ""small parts"" through vertical lift machines at our distribution centers. We are also investigating autonomous mobile carts to streamline the travel through the distribution center.

There is also an opportunity in some of the back-office functions (accounts payable, accounts receivable, marketing promotions, product descriptions, and even code development) using some of the technological advances over the last few years.

So, the view is, you must continue to improve and get better to compete in the future, and many of these technological advances will be instrumental in doing that.

Overall, residential sales were down in 2023. Do you feel we are entering more of a repair-instead-of-replace market?

Kesterton: Hard to say right now. With so many new innovative systems being offered today, many consumers will still prefer to change out the entire system. If the retail salesperson offers the choices and explains the benefits (technology, benefits of new refrigerant, etc.) many consumers will decide to move forward with a new comfort system. On the standard end (minimum efficiency) of the spectrum, there may be some homeowners and commercial establishments who decide to repair rather than replace.

Tarantine: I have seen a slight trend towards repair versus replace, but I believe our exceptionally mild weather has been the primary culprit on lower AOR sales.

Harvey: It is hard to predict the future. We have seen the markets change over the last 93 years we have been in business. Our plan has always been, as a full-service wholesale distributor, to make sure we have all the right products to service the HVACR industry, whether it is for repair, add-on/replacement, or new construction.

Young: The repair-versus-replace transition took place last year for us. Unprecedented equipment price increases, overall inflation, and economic uncertainty have been huge contributors to this transition.

Are the supply chain issues that were so prevalent in the last few years behind us?

Kesterton: I would say most but not all. 2024 will be the year to hopefully put all of the past behind us for good!

Tarantine: There are still some crucial areas for shortage, 460V, and larger commercial units, but overall, the supply chain is approaching pre-COVID lead times.

Harvey: We have seen the supply chain getting better with most manufacturers. There are still some significant issues with rooftop units and other commercial products. Supply-chain reliability is a variable that will continue to change from time to time. Our job as a distributor is to be prepared for disruptions and act quickly to minimize the shortages and make sure we have the products our customers need. Lately, this has been more challenging, and the refrigerant and efficiency changes will affect the next several years. We look forward to partnering with our manufacturers and customers to ensure continuous improvement.

Young: For the most part the supply chain has normalized. The only significant exception we are still wrestling with is commercial equipment. Lead times have come down a bit, but they are a far cry from normal. This has been our most significant supply-chain pain point.",achrnews.com,news,The ACHR NEWS,,0.2078431372549019,448975257,1,https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2024/03-March/Distributors-Roundtable.jpg?height=418&t=1711050945&width=800,

Foreign portfolio investors continue to remain confident about the Indian equity market and poured in more than Rs 38,000 crore in March so far, indicating a recovery in the sector after seeing months of outflow. Official data from the depositories revealed that the investors injected Rs 13,223 crore in the debt market as of March 22, showcasing their bullish attitude in the segment.

The investors remained optimistic about the market due to favourable shifts in the global economic scenario and robust outlook on the domestic economy, reported PTI. Prior to the month, the investors infused Rs 1,539 crore in February, and dumped equities worth Rs 25,743 crore in January, data revealed.

Notably, the overall FPI investment in equities stood at Rs 13,893 crore in 2024 so far and touched Rs 55,480 crore in debt market in the period. Elaborating on investor's movements, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director at Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said, ""FPIs have become significant buyers in March. The improved global economic conditions and positive Indian macroeconomic scenario have driven FPIs to invest in high growth-oriented markets like India.Additionally, the recent market correction has provided a buying opportunity.""

Experts also noted that the foreign funds inflow can lead to strong growth in GDP and the anticipation of a possible change in the RBI's policy. This could be followed by a rate cut of 25-50 basis points in the later half of the upcoming fiscal year, they said.

However, the trend reversed last week and FPIs became net sellers marginally, dumping $314 million approximately. This could be indicative of a cautious approach from the investors.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion. This investment will begin only by June 2024, and therefore, FPIs are doing some front running in view of this potential investment.""",news.abplive.com,news,english,,0.1843137254901961,448975257,1,https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/03/24/8aa9f5b4d2c5a7c9fa4b29599c36b4391711278316100800_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640,eng-9420238

Tuesday

The US Consumer Confidence is expected to remain unchanged at 106.7 in March. The last report interrupted a three-month positive streak as the data surprised with a big miss to the downside across the board. The commentary highlighted that ""while overall inflation remained the main preoccupation of consumers, they are now a bit less concerned about food and gas prices, which have eased in recent months. But they are more concerned about the labour market situation and the US political environment"". The Present Situation Index will be something to watch as that's generally a leading indicator for the unemployment rate.

Wednesday

The Australian Monthly CPI Y/Y is expected at 3.6% vs. 3.4% prior. The RBA focuses more on the quarterly CPI readings, but the monthly indicator is timelier and can be a guide for the trend, especially at turning points. The Core measures will be more important as that's what the RBA is more focused on. As a reminder, the RBA dropped the tightening bias in their recent monetary policy decision and we got a strong labour market report soon after. Therefore, unless we get a big downside surprise, the data shouldn't change much for the central bank and the market's pricing.

Fed's Waller will give a speech on the ""Economic Outlook"" at the Economic Club of New York. Waller is a key FOMC member because he's been a ""leading indicator"" for changes in Fed's policy. He was the first one talking about QT in December 2021 and the first one mentioning rate cuts in November 2023. Given the recent hot CPI reports and the FOMC decision, it will be interesting to hear from him and it's likely that he will deliver some hawkish comments.

Thursday

The US Jobless Claims continue to be one of the most important releases every week as it's a timelier indicator on the state of the labour market. This is because disinflation to the Fed's target is more likely with a weakening labour market. A resilient labour market though will make the achievement of the target much more difficult. Initial Claims keep on hovering around cycle lows, while Continuing Claims remain firm around the 1800K level. This week, Initial Claims are seen at 215K vs. 210K prior, while there's no consensus for Continuing Claims at the time of writing although the previous release saw an uptick to 1807K vs. 1820K expected and 1803K prior.

Friday

The Tokyo Core CPI Y/Y, which is seen as a leading indicator for National CPI, is expected at 2.4% vs. 2.5% prior. We got a Nikkei report recently which stated that the BoJ was considering a rate hike in July or October. If we start to get hot inflation data, the market might start to price in a July hike, but the Yen might not appreciate that much if the US data continues to surprise to the upside.

The US PCE Y/Y is expected at 2.4% vs. 2.4% prior, while the M/M measure is seen at 0.4% vs. 0.3% prior. The Core PCE Y/Y is expected at 2.8% vs. 2.8% prior, while the M/M reading is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.4% prior. Forecasters can reliably estimate the PCE once the CPI and PPI are out, so the market already knows what to expect.

Many nations have capitalized on their land and property assets to drive economic growth and diversify their income streams. For example, in 2019, the real estate sector contributed $3.5 trillion to the United States GDP, accounting for 17.5% of its total economic output. Similarly, the United Kingdom's property market generated £68.1 billion in revenue in 2018, showcasing the sector's significant financial impact.

Nigeria's real estate sector has enormous potential, given rising urbanization, uncensored population growth, and housing needs. However, it remains bogged down by challenges like unclear or impaired land titles, exorbitant costs of available real property, bureaucracy, unnecessary and avoidable infrastructure deficits, and lack of transparency and inefficiency, not only in government, but also with those involved in transactions. The market needs extensive reforms across policy, legal, regulatory, and financing frameworks to foster greater structure, standardization, development impact, and financial returns.

Dubai provides a highly relevant blueprint. Within two decades, it transformed itself into a leading global real estate destination by strategically deploying location advantages, business-friendly policies, top-notch infrastructure purposely deployed to encourage and enable investors, and relentless government support and promotion of the real estate market. This article explores the legal framework and strategies that have contributed to Dubai's success and how Nigeria can adapt these lessons to unlock its own real estate potential.

KEY FEATURES OF DUBAI'S EXCEPTIONAL REAL ESTATE LEGAL SYSTEM

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), particularly Dubai, has developed a remarkable real estate legal system that has contributed to its success as a global real estate investment destination. The emirate's real estate laws and regulations are designed to attract foreign investment, protect investors' rights, and ensure transparency in the market. Here are some key aspects of the emirate's real estate legal system that make it outstanding:

Freehold ownership for foreigners: In 2002, Dubai introduced a law allowing foreign ownership of property in designated areas, making it one of the first Gulf countries to do so. This has attracted significant foreign investment in the real estate sector.

Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA): Established in 2007, RERA is responsible for regulating and overseeing the real estate sector in Dubai. It aims to protect the rights of all parties involved in real estate transactions and promote transparency in the market.

Escrow accounts: Dubai's real estate laws mandate the use of escrow accounts for off-plan property sales. This ensures that developers cannot misuse investors' funds and that the money is only released when construction milestones are met.

Strata law: Dubai's Strata Title Law, introduced in 2007, provides a clear legal framework for the ownership and management of common areas in multi-unit developments, such as apartments and condominiums.

Real estate registry: The Dubai Land Department maintains a comprehensive real estate registry that records all property transactions, ensuring clarity of ownership and reducing the risk of fraud.

Dispute resolution: The Dubai Land Department has a dedicated Rental Disputes Center, which provides a streamlined process for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Courts and the Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) offer specialized dispute resolution services for real estate cases.

Investment protection: The UAE has signed bilateral investment treaties with numerous countries, providing additional protection for foreign investors in the real estate sector.

Tax advantages: The UAE does not impose income, capital gains, or property taxes on individuals, making it an attractive destination for real estate investment.

Long-term visas: In 2019, the UAE introduced long-term visas (up to 10 years) for investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals, which are tied to property ownership. This has further incentivized real estate investment in the country.

Challenges:

The Dubai real estate polices has been successfully implemented because the government and people of the country have collaborated to enable effectiveness leading to the tremendous progress and profit. The challenges with reforms working in Nigeria are numerous because of a lack of practical adherence to the rule of law. We are hopeful that government will implement favorable policies that uplift the sector, and also hopeful that corruption will not erode the gains derived from such policies.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NIGERIA

Nigeria can replicate components of the Dubai framework to reform and unlock the immense potential of its realty ecosystem. Features of the Dubai model that can be adopted include:

Institutional Reforms

Establish a federal real estate regulator: Create an independent overseer (like RERA in Dubai) that will work with States to establish and enforce standards, provide title guarantees, resolve disputes, coordinate state agencies, and streamline the convoluted approval processes. Boost buyer trust and developer compliance.

Set up Infrastructure Development Fund: Lack of power/energy, access roads, drainage, and water infrastructure increases costs and delays projects. Set up an integrated fund with public seed financing and private partnerships to fund infrastructure development on a user-fee/demand basis, or give economic or material incentives to private developers who can, and have the capacity to build these infrastructures.

Incentivize Free Trade & Business Zones: Provide tax holidays, single-window clearance, and customs duty relaxation for developers to establish Dubai-like self-contained townships integrated with offices, malls, and homes. Attract FDI into these zones to enable world-class development and catalyze wider market maturity.

Legal/Regulatory Overhaul

Real Estate Regulatory Bill: Draft comprehensive legislation covering consumer rights, standard project approval protocols, model buyer-seller agreements, dispute resolution mechanisms, and real estate transaction procedures to start with.

Title Regularization and Digitalization: Simplify and formally recognize existing land title mechanisms via a National Titling Bill. Set timelines for land agencies to fully digitize and integrate title records across states for transparency and efficiency.

Financial Reforms

Promote Public: Private Partnerships: Mobilize pension funds, insurance companies, and foreign investment into real estate by amending guidelines to increase asset allocation. Develop fail-safe risk mitigation tools.

Housing Development Fund: Set up an integrated mortgage liquidity facility to offer attractive long-term home finance rates and incentives. Provide specific incentives for developing low-cost housing projects across urban and semi-urban centers through private and public partnerships.

CONCLUSION

Actualizing the above policy and regulatory changes can significantly elevate standards, increase participation, and encourage financial flows into Nigeria's realty space over the next 3-5 years. The Dubai example reinforces the fact that visionary leadership and business-conducive governance can profoundly boost the market. The fundamentals necessary to replicate such a success story locally, are strongly positive and possible in our environment.",businessday.ng,news,Businessday NG,,0.388235294117647,448974783,1,https://cdn.businessday.ng/2023/04/real-estate-1-1.png,

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downwards for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

(NASDAQ:PAYX)?","Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has had a rough month with its share price down 3.0%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Paychex's ROE.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:

46% = US$1.6b ÷ US$3.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.46 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of Paychex's Earnings Growth And 46% ROE

Firstly, we acknowledge that Paychex has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 10% net income growth seen by Paychex over the past five years.

Next, on comparing Paychex's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It's important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is PAYX worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether PAYX is currently mispriced by the market.

Is Paychex Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

While Paychex has a three-year median payout ratio of 76% (which means it retains 24% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.

Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 44%.

Conclusion

In total, we are pretty happy with Paychex's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Josh Shapiro announced his new cap-and-trade program in March 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG -- As part of what his administration is calling a ""new era"" of energy policy, Gov. Josh Shapiro is proposing a state-based alternative to a cap-and-trade program aimed at fighting climate change, and a boost to renewable energy standards.

This approach to reducing emissions marks a departure from the course set by the Democrat's predecessor, Gov. Tom Wolf, who tried to unilaterally force Pennsylvania to set carbon caps.

Shapiro seeks GOP buy-in, so the future of his plan relies on uncertain support from a state Senate that has long resisted placing restrictions on the oil and gas industry.

""Now is the time to keep people coming together, to hear Democrat and Republican voices at the table, and to get stuff done for our fellow Pennsylvanians,"" Shapiro said at a March news conference. ""Doing nothing is not an option.""

While labor, environmental, and consumer protection groups have met Shapiro's proposal with optimism, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, R-Indiana, has pushed back, saying that any form of cap-and-trade program would be ""a very difficult piece to support.""

He expressed openness to changing the state's renewable energy standards but said that ultimately, ""once the House sends it to us ... understanding what those details are will be extremely helpful.""

One cornerstone of the plan is the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act, which would allow the state to cap the amount of carbon power plants can produce and force them to pay to emit pollution.

The idea is similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate cap-and-trade program championed by Wolf; Shapiro has not embraced it because he is unsure it would benefit consumer interests.

The other bill, dubbed the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standards Act, would increase the amount of power electricity companies have to buy from renewable energy sources.

Here's what you need to know about Shapiro's proposals and their likelihood of passing the state legislature:

What is PACER?

During his run for governor, Shapiro declined to say whether he'd keep Pennsylvania in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

RGGI is a cooperative of nearly a dozen states that agree to limit carbon emissions. These limits vary, but states coordinate them so that total reductions meet the initiative's agreed-upon environmental goals.

Participating states require most power plants that operate within their borders to buy allowances to emit carbon, which can be purchased at quarterly auctions. Price floors and ceilings are set by the states. Each state recoups revenue, which can then be used for climate mitigation projects, for driving down consumer costs, or for other purposes.

Wolf made Pennsylvania a member through executive action, but the state's participation has so far been blocked by courts.

A few months after taking office, Shapiro convened a working group to evaluate RGGI and possible alternatives. The group recommended the state pursue cap-and-trade to meet Shapiro's goals to meaningfully address climate change while also protecting jobs and consumers.

PACER would give the commonwealth the ability to set its cap on carbon emissions, rather than use one determined by the RGGI program participants collectively. The program would be run by the Department of Environmental Protection, Shapiro said.

The state would be free to decide what to do with the revenue, and Shapiro wants to use the bulk of it to fund electric bill rebates. (Because of the way Wolf justified Pennsylvania's entry into RGGI, the state would be required to put allowance revenue into the Clean Air Fund, which supports pollution reduction efforts.)

Shapiro has said that if the legislature passes PACER, he will pull out of RGGI.

Groups that favor cutting emissions have largely come out in support of PACER, but have expressed concerns about the lack of key details.

Namely, they want to know how DEP would determine how much carbon polluters can emit and how much they would have to pay to emit. How the carbon auctions will be administered and how frequently auctions would take place are also among environmentalists' concerns.

Rob Routh, a policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, wonders if PACER will use the same cap on carbon emissions as RGGI. If lawmakers limit DEP's ability to set a carbon cap to appeal to energy companies or state Senate Republicans, PACER could prove less effective than its interstate counterpart.

Routh also questioned whether out-of-state energy companies would be able to participate in PACER's carbon allowance auctions. RGGI's auctions are regional, meaning an energy company in Connecticut can buy an allowance from Rhode Island, for example, which creates a large market.

Routh added that he broadly supports Shapiro's initiative ""so long as any cap-and-invest program can deliver equivalent or superior benefits"" to RGGI.

Currently, two other states have their own cap-and-trade programs: California and Washington. They set carbon caps, which apply to power plants, fuel distributors, and other related industries, and they host quarterly auctions.

One clear difference between RGGI and PACER is the way Shapiro proposes to spend revenue. Rather than automatically funneling it into the Clean Air Fund, as RGGI would do, Shapiro says he wants PACER revenue to go toward programs that would cut utility costs.

Shapiro calls for 70% of the revenue to be returned to consumers in a rebate that would be deducted from residents' electric bills, which he projected would save ratepayers $252 million in the first five years.

Some of the remaining revenue would fund a year-round version of the state's Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which currently lets qualifying households apply for heating bill help from November to April.

Another part of the revenue would go to a new fund for energy projects in industries favored by state Senate Republicans, such as carbon capture and storage, retrofitting natural gas plants, and hydrogen production.

During his announcement, Shapiro also named as potential funding targets several long-time priorities for consumer protection advocates, such as lowering reconnection fees and expanding access to waivers that can prevent utility shut-offs for people with illnesses.

Liz Marx -- executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, an organization that provides legal aid to individuals struggling with housing or utility issues -- applauded the proposals, saying that she is encouraged to see Shapiro grouping environmental goals with consumer protections.

She noted that her position may change depending on the final language of the bills and how the legislature proceeds, adding that her support depends on whether lawmakers pass ""PACER without PRESS, PRESS without PACER, or PRESS and PACER without LIHEAP and other consumer protections.""

""We're seeing energy transition happen before our eyes. This proposal gives us a roadmap for taking some action,"" Marx said.

What is PRESS?

Shapiro's second proposal asks the legislature to amend the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act, which would fulfill a promise he made on the campaign trail to increase the state's renewable energy production.

Currently, Pennsylvania requires electricity companies to buy 8% of their power from so-called Tier 1 renewable sources such as wind or solar and 10% from Tier 2 sources like waste coal.

Shapiro wants to up the Tier 1 standard to 35% by 2035. He also wants to create a third tier with a 5% requirement, while the Tier 2 standard would remain the same.

Tier 1 would be expanded to include nuclear sources, while Tier 2 would add burgeoning energy industries for which the state has yet to establish separate regulatory processes. That includes coal- and natural-gas-powered hydrogen production. Tier 3 would include natural gas that utilizes carbon capture technology.

Shapiro argued during a news conference that adding nuclear power and carbon capture as a part of the state's renewable energy standards would attract new economic investment and create over 14,500 jobs. He did not specify how or where those jobs would be created, but said that increased demand for new energy sources like nuclear would generate construction jobs.

Environmental advocates also said implementing Shapiro's plan would help Pennsylvania qualify for federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act that reward states and corporations for investing in or utilizing renewable energy sources and projects.

Katie Blume, the legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, said she was ""thrilled"" when she heard Shapiro's initial goal of 35% by 2035.

However, she said industries such as hydrogen and carbon capture give her pause, adding that any legislation would need to require state oversight.

""These technologies will be less effective without strong regulations because if they end up ultimately polluting our communities, it's a lose-lose,"" Blume told Spotlight PA.

What will the legislature do?

Both PACER and PRESS would require the approval of the state legislature. While some Democrats have voiced support for the programs, party leadership has yet to explicitly back Shapiro's plan and declined to comment on its position.

The Republican-controlled state Senate has yet to commit either way.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, D-Delaware, leads the House's Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, through which the bills would have to pass. He supports the programs in theory but said he doesn't see much hope for getting PACER through the state Senate.

""My initial reaction to PACER is that the better approach is to proceed with RGGI if the court finds it legal,"" Vitali told Spotlight PA, referencing the Shapiro administration's appeal to the state Supreme Court. ""The problem with PACER is it's gonna be dead on arrival in the Senate.""

Vitali added that PRESS might be ""worth trying to negotiate,"" but would require some horse-trading with state Senate Republicans.

Republicans have been more outspoken about their concerns. Pittman, the state Senate majority leader, released a statement shortly after Shapiro's announcement that called on the governor to pull out of RGGI but did not explicitly mention either of the programs Shapiro proposed.

In a conversation with Spotlight PA, Pittman was not willing to completely write off Shapiro's RGGI alternative, saying that he needs the details of what the state House sends his way.

""The key challenge is, a cap-and-tax initiative is punitive and we shouldn't be having this conversation with a punitive mindset,"" Pittman said.

He made similar remarks regarding Shapiro's PRESS initiative, saying he supported the ""general efforts"" of the new renewable energy standards program but that passage in the state Senate would be contingent on ""what the House ultimately sends us.""

Pittman did say there are a few pieces of Shapiro's energy package that he feels have potential for collaboration, namely carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen development, and exploration of more advanced nuclear energy technology.

To advance in the state Senate, the proposals must pass through its Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. State Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, heads the committee and told Spotlight PA that he opposes all cap-and-trade programs.

Yaw argued the state should be trying to increase energy production and that a cap-and-trade program would discourage companies from setting up shop in Pennsylvania. He cited a study by PJM, the state's electricity provider, which found that future energy production may be insufficient to meet demand. Critics have argued those concerns are overstated.

Yaw added that he would consider changing renewable energy standards, saying that he supports energy diversification ""in a global sense."" But any bill would need to address his concern regarding increasing the state's overall energy production, he said.

""The governor never addresses the real problem,"" Yaw said.",triblive.com,news,TribLIVE,,0.1764705882352942,448974533,1,https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/03/7180008_web1_ptr-SPOTcarbon-032324.jpeg,

At the same time, Cronos investors are closely scrutinising forecasts of Cronos's future prices, aiming to predict upcoming market trends and base their decisions on solid insights.

Amidst this scenario, the swift movement of BlockDAG towards the completion of its presale's fourth batch sale is stirring excitement within the cryptocurrency sphere. Having collected over $7.6 million in its presale thus far, BlockDAG is capturing the spotlight with its potential for a staggering 5000x return on investment. This piece delves into the reasons behind the keen interest of investors in BlockDAG's ongoing presale highlighting the reasons behind its success, popularity and its significant ROI appeal to investors.

In the current market, Cronos finds itself in a phase of stabilization, its value fluctuating between $0.10 and $0.15. Despite multiple attempts to breach the $0.15 threshold, Cronos faces challenges in achieving a breakthrough, indicating a potential period of prolonged stability before any notable upward movement. This situation has led observers of Cronos's market projections to adopt a more guarded approach.

Although certain technical analyses present a somewhat bullish or neutral outlook, a wider view maintains a conservative expectation for growth, projecting an increase of less than 25%. These considerations lead to restrained forecasts for Cronos's valuation, taking into account the cryptocurrency's present standing and a longer-term perspective that tempers expectations for rapid expansion.

The forecast for BONK in the meme coin arena is a mixed bag, with opinions swinging from hopeful to guarded. The diversity in anticipated prices mirrors not only the unpredictable nature of the market but also the stiff rivalry that BONK encounters. For those invested in BONK, the current climate demands keen awareness and the ability to navigate through fluctuating market trends.

Though BONK has established a notable footprint within the meme coin sector, the steady introduction of competitors poses a risk to its market position. Such a dynamic environment necessitates constant vigilance from BONK investors, who must keenly observe how shifts in the market might influence their assets. To protect their investments, BONK enthusiasts are compelled to stay flexible and responsive to rapid market changes.

BlockDAG emerges as a groundbreaking contender set to transform the finance sector. Its goal to amass $100 million in liquidity shortly after its introduction underscores its burgeoning popularity and its potential to revolutionize the market. The aim to achieve this liquidity benchmark soon after the coin's debut reflects BlockDAG's potential to challenge established crypto giants which is resulting in widespread acceptance among the investment community.

Diverging from traditional blockchain models, BlockDAG leverages the cutting-edge Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This innovative approach facilitates unparalleled speeds in transaction processing and scalability that could dramatically change the operational efficiency of financial transactions. This leap forward in technology and capability heralds a new era, establishing BlockDAG as a key player in redefining the future of the financial industry.

The excitement generated by BlockDAG's presale underscores the market's robust faith in its potential, with expectations for an astonishing 5000X return on investment. This optimistic outlook is a clear reflection of the community's strong belief in BlockDAG's ability to deliver substantial returns to investors, capturing the true spirit of cryptocurrency investment opportunities with optimal ROI.

In a market fraught with uncertainties and intense rivalry, particularly for BONK holders and those keen on Cronos's market forecasts, BlockDAG emerges as the cryptocurrency stealing the spotlight. Its robust potential for market success and swift raise of $7.6M in presale underscores the high confidence investors are placing in it. The notable buzz and significant attention it has garnered illustrate its position as a viable choice for investors aiming for considerable gains within the cryptocurrency arena. For those navigating beyond the immediate market volatility of BONK and Cronos, BlockDAG presents an enticing story of progress and technological advancement.",analyticsinsight.net,news,Analytics Insight,Market Trends,0.3647058823529412,448974194,1,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture7gyhj.png,eng-9414190

However, the vast spread's massive residence has a curveball up its sleeve -- it's not quite finished yet.

According to Mansion Global, the pitcher, who retired last year, began construction on the mega-mansion in West Branson back in 2016 while he was playing for the Texas Rangers. Hamels and his wife later put the property up for sale in 2017 but ended up handing the spread over before it was completed to Camp Barnabas, a Christian summer camp for children with disabilities. The baseball player's former home was later purchased in February 2021 by its current owners, Samuel and Simona Bodea, the owners of SS Express, an Arizona-based trucking company.

""The current owners bought the home from Camp Barnabas and did major renovation work over the past three years,"" listing agent Jim Strong of Berkshire Hathaway's ReeceNichols told Mansion Global. Measuring a whopping 36,000 square feet, the stately compound features a main house and a separate guest dwelling. Since the Bodeas moved in, they've transformed the 14-bedroom, 15-bath main residence into a luxury event space to accommodate weddings or corporate outings. Currently, the couple resides in a five-bed, six-bath annex.

Among the updates made over the years by the Bodeas are adding underground plumbing, installing new electrical systems, and putting in a sinuous, tiered infinity swimming pool. On the main floor, the kitchen alone measures a commodious 2,000 square feet.

""Everything in the home is automated, including the water,"" Samuel told the listing site. ""There are no taps or valves here, you just talk to the house and say, 'Kohler, start a shower at 70 or 100 degrees [Fahrenheit],' then jump in."" Of course, there are other custom touches too, including exposed beams, barrel ceilings, and wood-trimmed casement windows and doors.

As it stands, Samuel told Mansion Global that the estate is almost finished, but the new owners are welcome to pick up where he and his wife left off. ""Someone could definitely still make it their dream home if that's what they want,"" Samuel said. ""No dream is too big or too small for this place.""",robbreport.com,news,Robb Report,Abby Montanez,0.07450980392156858,448974171,1,https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/colehamels.jpg?w=1024,

There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

Why could Roblox be a once-in-a-generation opportunity?

Metaverse technology is still in its relative infancy. The global metaverse industry is just starting to gain serious traction. According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Massive long-term potential

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

The bottom line

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.

Sammanfattning: Online gambling is a global multibillion dollar business that dwarfs all other forms of entertainment, and yet business and marketing research about it is scarce (Mizerski, 2013). The focus of gambling research has been on problem gamblers who ultimately represent a rather small, albeit important percentage of the gambling population. However, in the current Age of Chance (Reith, 2002) gambling, whether as a game of chance or taking risky action in the hope of a desired result (Lexico.com, 2019), is said to be at the very heart of our society. Indeed, business often operates in an environment of uncertainty that is increasingly online. This thesis seeks to address the paucity of marketing and business research in online gambling to better understand aspects that customers consider when gambling online. In doing so, the thesis commences by investigating semantic differences in the text used to achieve market positioning on the websites of online gambling firms. It proposes a new methodology that employs a combination of lexical and statistical analyses to understand how customers view content and how this is related to market positioning. Results show that firms that emphasise low certainty (or risk) are better positioned in customers' mind than those that put emphasis on action or certainty. The thesis proceeds to explore the literature for drivers of customers' online gambling intention and identifies perceived fairness and enjoyment, particularly anticipated enjoyment, as overlooked concepts. Anticipated enjoyment is defined as the enjoyment felt prior to the actual experience while perceived fairness encompasses procedural, distributive and interactional fairness. The research employs the theoretical frameworks of the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology - UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003; Venkatesh, Thong, & Xu, 2012). Anticipated enjoyment and perceived fairness are used as additional motivational drivers to enhance the models and better understand customers' online gambling intention. Data are collected via surveys and analyses using mediated regression and PLS-SEM suggest that both anticipated enjoyment and perceived fairness strongly impact customers' online gambling intention, whereas some of the UTAUT constructs fail to exhibit significance. Shorn of irrelevant relationships, a new Gambling Intention Model (GIM) is put forward. While the context of this study is online gambling, the resultant GIM may have broader application and can also potentially be applied to stock market traders and the insurance industry.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1450980392156862,448973391,1,,eng-9420813

The head of the International Monetary Fund on Sunday called on China to implement ""a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms"" to boost a sluggish economy beset by a housing market crisis, low domestic demand and persistently high youth unemployment.

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downward for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook.

The expert discussed historical economic data in his statements, comparing Bitcoin and gold. Moreover, the analyst indicated in his statements that Bitcoin will leave precious metals behind in terms of rise in the coming years.

ContentsBitcoin and Gold ComparisonHistorical Analogy for Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Gold Comparison

Senior analyst Jamie Coutts, while expecting gold to rise, anticipated that the cryptocurrency would significantly overshadow the precious metal as markets give rise to a new asset class. The analyst stated in his remarks:

Crypto currency exchanges list products (ETP) with Assets Under Management (AUM) of about 100 billion dollars (80% Bitcoin). For gold ETPs, AUM is approximately 190 billion dollars. I believe in gold's rise, but it won't match the expected 2-3 fold increase of crypto currency in this cycle. This is the birth of a new asset class.

Historical Analogy for Cryptocurrencies

Jamie Coutts compares the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), and cryptocurrencies to the stock market boom in the early 1980s. According to the analyst, Generation Y could outperform inflation with crypto units just as they did with stock investments over the last 40 years. The analyst concluded his remarks on the subject as follows:

What 1982 was for the Boomer generation, 2009 is for Generation Y. The great secular bull market in stocks began with Boomers fully entering the workforce. The great secular bull market in Bitcoin (and blockchain assets in general) started when governments and the Boomers they represent decided to punish all subsequent generations for their own sins during a period marked by the GFC (Great Financial Crisis). No one was punished for the GFC, bonuses were honored, and industry's takeover of regulations (where banks, big food, big pharma, and big tech became too big to fail) worsened. The government decided that the way forward was through debt and devaluation rather than restraint and integrity. Bitcoin is an antidote specifically created for an age of adulteration and debt. A new form of solid money synthesized with technology, finally a fair and transparent financial network. Moreover, as it has throughout history, as it is doing today through inflation, it is an asset that can be entrusted to oneself, away from banks and governments that will seize it when needed.

India becomes largest gaming market worldwide with 568 million gamers (WATCH),"With a staggering user base of 568 million gamers and over 9.5 billion gaming app downloads in 2023, India has firmly secured its position as the largest gaming market worldwide.

In a groundbreaking revelation, a recent report titled 'Robust Fundamentals to Power Continued Growth' has unveiled India as the reigning champion in the global gaming arena. With a staggering user base of 568 million gamers and over 9.5 billion gaming app downloads in 2023, India has firmly secured its position as the largest gaming market worldwide.

The report sheds light on the remarkable growth trajectory of the gaming industry in India, propelled by the mobile-first phenomenon. With mobile gaming contributing a whopping 90% to the market, India surpasses even gaming giants like the US and China in terms of mobile game downloads, accounting for approximately 20% of the world's total.

One of the most significant driving forces behind this unprecedented growth is the localization of gaming content. By introducing vernacular languages and Indian themes, gaming platforms have successfully expanded their reach to non-English speaking clusters, particularly in rural areas where internet penetration is on the rise. This strategic move has not only broadened the addressable user base but has also facilitated inclusivity, catering to the diverse linguistic and cultural fabric of the nation.

Moreover, the report highlights a notable shift in demographics, with women constituting approximately 40% of the gaming populace in India. This surge in female gamers, demonstrating a penchant for casual and hypercasual gaming experiences, marks a significant departure from the gaming landscape of yesteryears. Just three years ago, only one in five gamers in India was a woman, underscoring the rapid diversification and democratization of gaming culture in the country.

Another compelling aspect revealed by the report is the emergence of paying users, accounting for around 20% of the gaming population in India. Pay-to-play, casual, and core games have emerged as the top choices among the paying user base, with in-app purchases projected to witness exponential growth at a staggering rate of approximately 35% CAGR. This surge in paying users across different genres reflects not only the increasing monetization potential but also the evolving preferences and spending habits of Indian gamers.

In conclusion, the findings of the report paint a vivid picture of India's ascendance as a global gaming powerhouse. With its burgeoning user base, innovative localization strategies, and evolving demographic trends, India stands at the forefront of the gaming revolution, poised for continued growth and expansion in the years to come. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, India's influence is set to reverberate across the global gaming industry, shaping trends and redefining paradigms in the digital entertainment landscape.",newsable.asianetnews.com,news,Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,,0.4274509803921569,448973204,1,https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01hsqzme501n99kbjbbk0w2hte/gaming-market-newsable.jpg,

KERICHO - In a move to bolster public confidence in legal services, the Advocates Complaints Commission (ACC) engaged Kericho residents in a sensitization initiative, educating them on the process for addressing grievances against legal practitioners. The event, hosted at the Kericho Teachers Training College, aimed to clarify the commission's role and the types of complaints that can be filed against advocates.

According to Kenya News Agency, the commission, which operates under the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General and Department of Justice, is tasked with receiving, investigating, and resolving complaints against advocates. During his presentation, Nyaga outlined various misconducts that could lead to disciplinary action, including misappropriation of client funds, lack of transparency with clients, failure to attend court, and conflicts of interest, among others.

Nyaga emphasized that the ACC provides its services without charge and is dedicated to enhancing the legal profession's integrity. He encouraged aggrieved individuals to report issues promptly, ensuring that evidence remains current. Highlighting the commission's impact, Nyaga disclosed that in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, the ACC addressed 2,863 complaints, with numerous cases already managed in the current year.

The forum also served as an educational platform, advising participants on best practices when engaging with advocates. These include the importance of written agreements concerning legal fees, communication protocols, and document management to ensure clarity and accountability in attorney-client relationships.

Participants learned about the procedure for lodging complaints, starting with downloading a help form from the ACC's website, attaching relevant documentation, and submitting their grievances for review. However, Nyaga clarified that the ACC does not handle cases related to advocates' negligence or complaints against judicial officers and State Counsels.

The tragic death of two students and the injuring of 23 more at the botched distribution of palliatives at the Nasarawa State University on Friday is a disturbing addition to what has been a troubling period for undergraduates in Nigeria.

Just last Friday, nine students of the Federal University Gusau regained their freedom after spending over 170 days in terrorists' captivity. On Thursday, three medical students of the Abia State University died in a road traffic accident while returning from their seniors' induction.

Unlike these other tragedies, however, the Nasarawa stampede could have been envisaged and prevented. The successful distribution of similar palliatives at the University of Ilorin shows us how we can do things differently.

Following subsidy removal and the attendant inflation in the country, several state governments distributed palliatives -- foodstuffs and stipends -- to ease the economic burden on citizens. Some states like Kwara and Nasarawa recently extended the palliatives to students in their tertiary institutions.

The initial distribution of the palliatives across institutions in Nasarawa State was peaceful. A government statement released after Friday's stampede noted that previous distributions were ""a huge success."" Students got two 7.5 kg bags of rice and 5,000 naira each.

However, events leading to the stampede at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, points towards a mismanagement of crowd control by the organizers responsible for distributing the palliatives. According to media reports, the palliatives were scheduled at the university convocation square until students arrived in large numbers and disrupted the distribution.

""After our arrangement for the distribution of palliatives to the students which was to be held at the University's convocation square, they (students) suddenly arrived at the venue in their numbers and overpowered the security,"" said Yunusa Baduku, National President of the Nasarawa State Students Association, in a Punch Online report.

He added that the students ""broke through the gate into the Convocation square where the bags of rice were to be shared,"" leading to the stampede that consumed the two students and injured many more.

Sadly, such chaos is not new. In February, the Nigerian Customs Service had to suspend its sale of seized bags of rice after seven people died at one of its centres in Yaba, Lagos. Some two years ago, 31 people died at a stampede at the King's Assembly in Rivers State during the distribution of palliatives to church members; seven more were injured.

Although the state governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, was quoted as calling the tragedy ""a needless stampede,"" the state could have prepared better for it. Distribution events, especially those intended to provide aid or relief, tend to draw large crowds, making effective crowd control essential.

In Unilorin, for instance, where students received palliatives -- cartons of noodles -- from the Kwara State government, distributions were such that students did not have to gather in their numbers at the arena or use vouchers.

The government sent the palliatives to the university, who distributed them to the faculties. From the faculties, they were distributed to departments, where class representatives from each level went to retrieve the packages for their class. It was as seamless as public distributions go.

I suppose the Unilorin model could help other tertiary institutions plan more effectively. The university leveraged student associations and divided the population into manageable chunks. Such divisions made it difficult for hoodlums to gatecrash, as the class reps knew their colleagues. The strategy also eased accountability.

While I admit there is a risk of student representatives appropriating the palliatives or short-changing their colleagues, this is more manageable than asking a crowd of desperate undergraduates to gather for government handouts.

A departmental or level advisor can be mandated to coordinate the distribution, even if he has to be paid or receive palliatives, too. It is not likely that the coordinator will conspire with the student reps to loot the palliatives. In the rare event that that happens, then so be it. Nigeria students have suffered enough than to die in avoidable stampedes.",dailytrust.com,news,Daily Trust,,-0.192156862745098,448972828,1,https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nasa-1-300x400.jpg,eng-9417263

This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

UK's Bitcoin ETF Advocacy

Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a ""basic fundamental"" for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.

ICYMI: Kraken UK Managing Director Bivu Das says he'd ""absolutely"" like to see a #Bitcoin ETF in the UK, providing regulated access to crypto exposure currently lacking and boost UK's crypto hub ambitions, and legitimize bitcoin for institutions.

-- AP Crypto (@AP_Crypto_) March 23, 2024

However, the FCA remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance, some argue, puts the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can readily invest in Bitcoin ETFs.

Das contends that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even alleviate some regulatory concerns, as investors wouldn't directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could potentially pave the way for a more open approach from the FCA.

There are signs the FCA might be inching towards a more accommodating stance. They recently approved the launch of crypto ETNs, but only for institutional investors. This move, while limited, could be seen as a cautious step towards wider crypto investment opportunities.

While the regulatory body remains cautious, warning of potential risks for retail investors in the volatile crypto market, the FCA's recent actions suggest a willingness to explore the space further.

Expanding UK's Investment Options

Coinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, echoes Das' sentiment. He believes ""consumers have more options"" with a wider range of investment products like ETFs. This push for increased investor choice aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.

However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK's financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the crypto market raises concerns about the suitability of such complex instruments for inexperienced investors.

The recent influx of billions into US Bitcoin ETFs highlights the growing investor appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.

The future of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK remains uncertain. The FCA is likely to take a measured approach, carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks before making any significant changes. However, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with increasing investor demand, suggests that a more open approach from the FCA might be inevitable.",cryptodaily.co.uk,news,cryptodaily.co.uk,,0.3019607843137255,448972719,1,,eng-9420709

Whereas the S&P 500 is the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, and the Dow Jones is considered a barometer for blue chip stocks, the Nasdaq is a growth-focused index weighted heavily toward the technology sector.

In November 2021, the Nasdaq dropped into a bear market amid recession fears brought on by runaway inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. The index declined 36% before reaching its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But the recession many economists expected has yet to materialize. Instead, economic growth accelerated last year, and many stocks rebounded sharply, helped along by cooling inflation and excitement about artificial intelligence.

The Nasdaq finally reached a new record high on Feb. 29, 2024. Crossing that threshold made the new bull market official, a development that has historically portended substantial gains for investors. Specifically, the Nasdaq has only been through eight other bull markets since 1990, and the index has generally moved much higher during those periods.

Read on to learn more.

History says the Nasdaq Composite could soar 157% by April 2026

Some investors use the term bull market loosely, often to describe a substantial gain following a recent low. But other investors subscribe to a more precise definition, which stipulates that two things must happen for a bull market to occur:

What makes that definition tricky is the timing. A bull market technically begins when an index reaches its bear market low, but it does not become official until it reaches a record high. For instance, the current Nasdaq Composite bull market started when the index reached its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But it was not official until 14 months later, when the index reached a new high on Feb. 29, 2024.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq has experienced eight complete bull markets since 1990. The table below provides details on each of those events.

Data source: YCharts. Note: Percentages and averages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

As shown above, the Nasdaq returned an average 215% during the eight bull markets that have taken place since 1990, and it realized those returns over an average of 1,223 days (about 40 months). Put differently, the Nasdaq returned about 41% annually during past bull markets. We can use that information to make a somewhat educated guess about the future.

Specifically, the Nasdaq has advanced 58% since the current bull market began about 15 months ago. That leaves implied upside of 157% over the next 25 months. In other words, the Nasdaq should return 57% annually through April 2026 if its performance aligns with the historical average. I call that a somewhat educated guess because past bull markets have varied greatly in terms of returns and duration, which means there is a great deal of uncertainty baked into my estimate.

Ultimately, the economic climate plays a major role in how the index performs over any period, and past performance never guarantees future results. For instance, the current bull market follows a pandemic that pushed U.S. inflation to its highest level since 1981. That prompted the Federal Reserve to embark on its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in decades. Those events could impact the economy for years to come, so the current bull market may not follow the historical pattern.

In fact, I would be surprised if the Nasdaq returned anything close to 157% over the next 25 months. I say that because the S&P 500, the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, currently trades at 25.6 times earnings. That is a significant premium to the 10-year average of 21.2 times earnings, indicating that many stocks have historically expensive valuations.

Short-term results are variable, but history says long-term investors will be well rewarded

Predicting the future performance of the stock market is impossible, but some forecasting methods are better than others. In most cases, rather than focusing on specific events like bull markets, it makes more sense to consider performance across all market environments. That strategy should yield more reliable results simply because it accounts for more data points.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq Composite has increased 3,500% since 1990, compounding at an annual rate of 11%. That period covers a broad enough range of economic climates that similar returns are likely in the future. That does not mean the index will return 11% every year, but rather that its average return will land somewhere around 11% per year over the next three or four decades.

Investors can capitalize on that data by purchasing an index fund that tracks the Nasdaq Composite. Alternatively, given the technology-heavy nature of the index, investors could also benefit from adding some technology stocks to their portfolios. That is especially true of companies in fast-growing markets like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and robotic process automation.

TreeFolks, Central Texas' urban forestry nonprofit, plants on average nearly 100,000 trees and saplings each year, and is working with Jacob'sWell Natural Area to pilot a new system aimed to more than triple survival rates among newly planted trees.

This spring TreeFolks planted 2.2 acres with almost 2,000 native and adapted tree species at Jacob's Well. The varieties of trees include shade trees and fruiting and flowering species, including Pecan, Texas Mountain Laurel, Elderberry, and Honey Mesquite, in addition to the iconic Live Oak variety. These trees will improve the health of the floodplain area next to Cypress Creek, improving both the water quality and the overall ecosystem health of the riparian buffer zone.

The new Groasis Waterboxx captures rainwater and slowly releases extra water to the newly planted trees throughout the year. TreeFolks used 250 Groasis Waterboxxes at the Jacob's Well site, with two trees in each box. Throughout the summer, staff will monitor the water levels in the boxes, and this fall, TreeFolks will determine if the new technology was able to bolster survival rates, and by how much. The Waterboxxes are designed to give trees just enough water to survive, but not so much that they depend on the box, forcing the tree roots to search deeper for water.

""We are very excited to try out this technique. Summers are getting hotter and drier, and it has taken a toll on trees throughout the region. If seedlings can survive their first summer, it is a great indicator of their ability to survive long-term. If the study is successful, it would be a game changer because we would be better able to control survival instead of depending on adequate rainfall each year after we plant,"" Valerie Tamburri, Lead Arborist and Director of Reforestation at TreeFolks, said.

'This will truly help our restoration efforts at Jacob's Well for reforestation in the southern part of the park. I am really excited to see these newly planted trees grow over the next few years. We are grateful to Treefolks for offering this flood restoration program,"" said Nina Leonard, Parks Specialist I.

A major shift in how Americans buy homes could come this summer after a powerful real estate group settled an antitrust lawsuit, agreeing to change a rule that dictates how real estate agents are compensated.

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of buying or selling a home will look like.

Here's what we know about the settlement and what it could mean for the housing market in the US.

What's changing

Home sellers and buyers get their own agents, who are supposed to help them navigate the market. Most agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), paying dues to be a part of the organization of 1.5 million agents.

Being part of the NAR gives agents access to the organization's listings, known as ""multiple listing service"" or the MLS, where seller agents can post properties up for sale and where buying agents can see what homes are on the market.

Currently, the NAR has a rule that requires seller agents to include the commission that is being paid to sell the house. The standard rate ranges from 5% to 6%, meaning commission on the US average home at the end of 2023, $391,700, could reach up to $23,502. Though sellers are the ones that pay the commission, the compensation is usually split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent.

NAR has emphasized that the organization does not establish commission rates at 5% to 6% as a rule and that commissions are technically negotiable. Rather, the organization requires seller agents to list a commission, which is usually the standard rate.

As part of the settlement, NAR said it will no longer allow commission rates to be posted on its listings. The organization is also requiring buyer agents to have written agreements with buyers they work with.

Why this change is a big deal for homebuyers

Consumer advocates are praising the settlement as a step toward transparency in the home-buying marketplace.

""From a consumer standpoint, this is a complicated, opaque marketplace,"" said Steve Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America who has written extensively about the real estate industry. After the settlement, the marketplace ""will become a little less opaque"".

The settlement could ultimately change what is baked into the sale price of a home, making clear to buyers exactly what they are paying for.

Because seller agents and buyer agents usually split commission, which is paid for by a home seller, many homebuyers do not pay their agents directly. Rather, sellers increase the price of their homes to compensate for the commission they pay the real estate agents.

In other countries, commissions on real estate transactions tend to be lower. In the UK, the average commission is 1.3%, in Australia, it is 2.5%.

The possibilities are more open now than ever before

Max Besbris, University of Wisconsin-Madison

""The decoupling of seller agent and buyer agent fees allows for a lot more flexibility and novelty in how agents are going to get paid,"" said Max Besbris, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The possibilities are more open now than ever before. We're really going to see, generally, a lot more transparency.""

Since buyer agents will be required to write up agreements with their clients, buyers will have more room to negotiate commissions with their agents, depending on what services they need from them. Some may opt for a flat-rate fee or pay their agent by the hour.

With the settlement upending the default relationship many buying agents have with their clients, homebuyers are going to have to become more savvy about what they can get from an agent and what services they are willing to pay for.

""It's going to take a lot more consumer information and education to know that there are alternatives and other kinds of fee structures,"" Besbris said.

Some buyer agents may still try to split commission with seller agents who advertise their commission on other platforms besides the MLS, but maintaining the practice will be harder for agents with the new rule.

Will this bring home prices down?

It's unclear whether this change will have an impact on home prices, at least in the short-term. Experts agree that home prices won't be impacted any time soon.

While sellers could price their homes lower because they no longer shoulder the cost of the seller and buying agents, many buyers will still be paying for their own agent, just in a more direct way. Thus the overall cost of buying a home could remain the same.

But the settlement can empower buyers to negotiate how much they pay their agent, which could also lead to an overall lower cost of buying a home.

A more transparent marketplace

While it's unclear what changes the settlement will bring to home prices, experts agree that it will likely change who gets to continue working in the real estate industry.

The settlement will probably encourage buyers to become more invested in who they choose as their agent, as they will be paying them more directly, making it more competitive for buying agents to find clients.

Consumer advocates have argued that there is a glut of real estate agents working in the field, given the licensing process to become an agent is fairly simple. While there is demand for real estate agents with experience, some working in the field don't always work in good faith.

""It's very difficult to police this marketplace because the regulators have limited resources, and they're not fully committed to this. It's very difficult to see ethical and even legal violations,"" Brobeck said. ""A lot of this is just oral agreements between listing brokers, listing agents and buyer agents.""

The settlement could mean a ""more experienced pool of real estate agents and, ultimately, better service for more competitive prices"" for buyers, said Sonia Gilbukh, assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College.

""The high fixed fees that don't depend on experience is what kept a lot of people in the market. Even working with just one deal makes it worthwhile for people to stay,"" Gilbukh said.

What prompted the settlement

The settlement comes out of a series class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued it was unfair they had to cover the commissions of buyer brokers.

The NAR agreed to pay $418m in damages and to change its commission rules to settle the suits.

In October, a federal jury had found the NAR guilty in on one of the suits, finding the organization and other residential brokerages liable for $1.78bn in damages for conspiring to artificially inflate commissions.

NAR has denied the price-fixing allegations. In a statement, NAR's interim CEO, Nykia Wright, said that the organization's goal is ""to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible"".

""This settlement achieves both of those goals,"" Wright said. While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR.""

A powerful industry group heels

That the settlement is expected to have such a widespread impact on real estate transactions shows just how much power NAR has over the industry, experts point out.

""It is a very big deal to see them take a loss,"" Bresbis said. ""They haven't really had to in the entirety of their existence, maybe since the New Deal.""

The group, which was founded in 1908, has $1bn in assets and has been a powerful lobbying arm for the real estate industry.

But the real estate industry has been going through intense changes over the last decade. Record-high home prices have left many homebuyers disgruntled by the market - a majority of renters in a recent Harris poll indicated that the American dream of buying a home is dead - and new technology has empowered buyers with more information about the market. Instead of relying solely on a broker, homebuyers can also turn to websites like Zillow or Redfin - both alternatives to the NAR's MLS - to try to find their home.

NAR's settlement shows how the organization, while still powerful in the real estate industry, is starting to wobble under these pressures.

""For so many decades, NAR was essentially the central organization in determining the shape of housing policy,"" Besbris said. ""To see them on the backfoot is a big shift in how much power they have.""",aol.com,news,Aol,,0.1529411764705881,448972600,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_702/eb95b37ad115bc5f4fa4dd40d72fb5fc,eng-9420431

Gaming platform Roblox (RBLX -1.14%) has been an incredible growth story in recent years. There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Matt Frankel,0.4039215686274509,448972371,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770051/gaming-2022.jpg,

This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a ""basic fundamental"" for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.

However, the FCA remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance, some argue, puts the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can readily invest in Bitcoin ETFs.

Das contends that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even alleviate some regulatory concerns, as investors wouldn't directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could potentially pave the way for a more open approach from the FCA.

There are signs the FCA might be inching towards a more accommodating stance. They recently approved the launch of crypto ETNs, but only for institutional investors. This move, while limited, could be seen as a cautious step towards wider crypto investment opportunities.

While the regulatory body remains cautious, warning of potential risks for retail investors in the volatile crypto market, the FCA's recent actions suggest a willingness to explore the space further.

Coinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, echoes Das' sentiment. He believes ""consumers have more options"" with a wider range of investment products like ETFs. This push for increased investor choice aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.

However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK's financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the crypto market raises concerns about the suitability of such complex instruments for inexperienced investors.

The recent influx of billions into US Bitcoin ETFs highlights the growing investor appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.

The future of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK remains uncertain. The FCA is likely to take a measured approach, carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks before making any significant changes. However, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with increasing investor demand, suggests that a more open approach from the FCA might be inevitable.",bitcoinist.com,news,Bitcoinist.com,,-0.02745098039215688,448972359,1,https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a28a48.jpg,eng-9420709

But former chief executive CY Leung says better understanding of traders’ needs needed, rather than ‘relying solely on financial incentives’

Redevelopment of Hong Kong’s famous Flower Market will not “destroy” its charm, but improve the environment for traders and contribute to the city’s long-term future, the head of the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) has said.

Wai Chi-sing, the managing director of the authority emphasised on Sunday that plans to revamp the historic area to bring it up to date was its best chance to guarantee prosperity in the years ahead.

He said that the proposals to revitalise the Mong Kok market would benefit traders because private developers did not as a rule offer better compensation or relocation packages than the URA.

“Just imagine if the buildings are not redeveloped by the URA in an orderly manner, but get picked up by private developers for their separate development projects, how would it affect the integrity of the market?” Wai asked in a blog post.

“Not only would shop tenants not receive compensation assistance from the URA, let alone the option of transitional or relocation operations under such circumstances, how could the atmosphere and characteristics of the flower market be preserved and continued?”

Wong launched his defence of the partial makeover plan for the market after a former leader of the city, Leung Chun-ying, also an ex-URA board member, and others warned that more careful planning was needed to preserve the site.

The proposals include the creation of a canal to link the area’s public leisure areas, the redevelopment of 31 buildings more than 60 years old, as well as the upgrading shops in the market and neighbouring areas such as Sai Yee Street and Fa Yuen Street.

The redevelopment plan, unveiled earlier this month, sparked concerns by flower sellers and residents in the area, who said they were worried that proposals could take the bloom off the unique characteristics and authenticity of the market.

Leung appealed for more careful planning and a stronger understanding of the neighbourhood’s needs, “rather than relying solely on financial incentives”.

He added the authority’s attempts to improve the Bird Garden in Mong Kok, a haven for caged songbirds and their owners, and redevelopment of Wing On Street in Central, formerly known as “Cloth Lane” because of its array of fabric sellers, had ended up being “lifeless”.Mong Kok flower market set for partial makeover in Hong Kong renewal project

But Wai said it was unfair to criticise plans to improve the area of the Flower Market and guarantee the livelihoods of traders.

“Remarks that equate ‘redevelopment’ with the destruction or elimination of local characteristics in a generalised way, while ignoring problems faced by flower market vendors and the need for sustainable development, lack a forward-looking vision,” he added.

“[These comments] are not beneficial to Hong Kong’s long-term development.”

He explained consultants approached more than a hundred flower shops and related businesses in the area before they started the urban planning process to understand the business environment, habits of visitors, and their expectations.Mong Kok flower market makeover must keep character

Wai said a survey found more than 90 per cent of flower sellers who responded felt there was a need for extra parking spaces and improved pedestrian access to boost foot traffic and attract more visitors.

More than half of those polled said present policies did not provide opportunities for business expansion and that there had been a decline in business because of an increased trend towards buying flowers online.

More than half of shop operators and visitors suggested the design of surrounding areas should be improved to include “flower-viewing hotspots” and diversification of activity to enhance the market’s appeal.

Wai said plans such as the relocation of some stores to create more space, a proposed multipurpose building and underground public car park with about 220 spaces, extra loading and unloading docks and the construction of an “urban waterway” would help tackle people’s concerns.",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.6000000000000001,448972352,1,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/24/bea345b1-e7c7-4ef1-98fe-854b1227f8c2_8388b78e.jpg?itok=ulnqYlKx,

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downward for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook.

Athleisure wear is all about feeling good without compromising on style. Be it making its way to clubs or brunches, athleisure wear has stood the test of trends proving versatility and practicality is beyond what's in vogue.""

He added, ""Innovation and design remain the ultimate constants that have steered the unfettered dominance of athleisure wear across ramps and trends. High-quality materials and innovative techniques have been able to provide optimal comfort and support while acing the style game. The use of innovative fabrics like organic cotton, elastane, and bamboo have opened doors for athleisure wear to beyond gym. Whether it's moisture-wicking fabrics or ergonomic stitching every aspect has been thoughtfully engineered to enhance performance and mobility, curating the elixir for enhanced confidence and OOTDs.""

Bringing his expertise to the same, Rajat Khurana, Managing Director at ASICS India and South Asia, revealed, ""The lines between fitness-focused apparel and everyday style are blurring beautifully. The term known as ""Athleisure/ Sportstyle"" has become a trend and it isn't just about comfort; it signals a shift towards a lifestyle that prioritizes well-being and adaptability. For eg: A sleek pair of tights can take you from a morning Yoga class to a casual lunch with friends, while a stylish performance t-shirt can transition smoothly from a gym session to running or errands around town. Modern athleisure offers a sense of dynamism that resonates with the fast-paced, multifaceted lives we lead.""

Asserting that numbers don't lie and that athleisure is a lasting trend, he pointed out, ""According to the grand view research, the global athleisure market surged to $304 billion in 2020, and it's projected to reach $478 billion by 2027. This impressive growth showcases the desire for clothing that supports both active pursuits and the multifaceted nature of modern living. The rise of athleisure reflects a fundamental shift in how we approach our wardrobes. Consumers crave clothing that empowers them to move freely, express themselves confidently and tackle diverse activities from the gym to the office to social gatherings without sacrificing style or performance.""

He concluded, ""It's an exciting time for brands to innovate in this space pushing the boundaries of functionality and aesthetics. It's no longer a question of sacrificing fashion for function instead, it's about finding harmony in the convergence of the two, creating a wardrobe that effortlessly supports the dynamic lifestyles. Every moment is an opportunity to showcase strength and sophistication, where the lines between fitness and fashion blur beautifully, and let energy shine through every stitch.""

In essence, athleisure wear isn't just about what you wear; it's about how it makes you feel. It's about embracing a lifestyle that celebrates movement, self-expression, and confidence.

Call for Papers ∣ The 10th Deleuze and Guattari Studies in Asia Conference∣Technology and Life

As a supplement to human beings as ""animal manqué,"" technology has to be understood paradoxically as an ability developed due to the lack of appropriate innate bio-power. Ironically, human beings came to dominate the world precisely because he had this originary default. But technology in turn has proven to be a pharmakon which both improves human living and endangers the world. The extreme form of this pharmacological conundrum no doubt has been articulated by Heidegger and later taken up and modified by Bernard Stiegler.

What do Gilles Deleuze and Pierre-Félix Guattari have to say on technology, especially in view of the fact that AI, as an unforeseen game changer, seems to have forced our world into a phase where the above-mentioned pharmacological status of technology is tilting toward one end of the opposition? Taking into consideration recent posthumanist accounts of objects (often ramifications and further developments of Deleuze and Guattari's as well as Alfred Whitehead's thoughts) as having forces, autopoietic cybernetic traits, and even the ability to ""prehend,"" it may be surmised that the potential of technological objects, especially of AI, is yet to be fully fathomed. One testimony to this potential is the development of AI applications like ChatGPT and Sora. Furthermore, while the Anthropocene has seen the world turned upside down by humans mainly by means of technology, we may be entering a new phase aptly termed the ""Technocene"" where technology is not only multiplying its impact on the world but also is becoming autonomous of human control. And it seems less and less merely a SF fantasy that the moment of Singularity might materialize in an imaginable future.

Hence, we urgently need to treat technology both as subject-like objects and as machines. As objects, technological products have its bodily existence in both visible and invisible forms; as machines, they are embedded in the social networks. Both approaches have been proposed by Deleuze and Guattari and it remains for us to integrate them into a new and timely redefinition of technology.

And yet, a genuine integration of these two approaches is predicated on the Deleuzian concept of life. Timely acts of counter-actualization are required so that re-connections with the outside, and ultimately with the plane of immanence, the realm of differentiation or the virtual, is possible. It is thus only by making machines break down that we can be enabled to, as Deleuze and Guattari suggest, adopt a kind of existence ""closer to animals and rocks."" Only such an existence allows us to participate in what Deleuze and Guattari call ""aparallel evolution"" by becoming.

How then does technology bear on life? Are we able to forge a desirable block of becoming with technology? The principal question would be: would technology stifle the possibility of becoming, of counter-actualizing, or facilitate it? In other words, would it aggravate stratification or open up lines of flight? Most urgently, if the moment of Singularity is imminent, do we still have a window for thinking this ""or""? Therefore, now is the critical moment for reflecting on the meaning of technology. How to make technology a partner of humanity without obscuring or even cutting off the pulse of life is the greatest challenge for humanity at the present moment.

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of buying or selling a home will look like.

Here's what we know about the settlement and what it could mean for the housing market in the US.

Home sellers and buyers get their own agents, who are supposed to help them navigate the market. Most agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), paying dues to be a part of the organization of 1.5 million agents.

Being part of the NAR gives agents access to the organization's listings, known as ""multiple listing service"" or the MLS, where seller agents can post properties up for sale and where buying agents can see what homes are on the market.

Currently, the NAR has a rule that requires seller agents to include the commission that is being paid to sell the house. The standard rate ranges from 5% to 6%, meaning commission on the US average home at the end of 2023, $391,700, could reach up to $23,502. Though sellers are the ones that pay the commission, the compensation is usually split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent.

NAR has emphasized that the organization does not establish commission rates at 5% to 6% as a rule and that commissions are technically negotiable. Rather, the organization requires seller agents to list a commission, which is usually the standard rate.

As part of the settlement, NAR said it will no longer allow commission rates to be posted on its listings. The organization is also requiring buyer agents to have written agreements with buyers they work with.

Consumer advocates are praising the settlement as a step toward transparency in the home-buying marketplace.

""From a consumer standpoint, this is a complicated, opaque marketplace,"" said Steve Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America who has written extensively about the real estate industry. After the settlement, the marketplace ""will become a little less opaque"".

The settlement could ultimately change what is baked into the sale price of a home, making clear to buyers exactly what they are paying for.

Because seller agents and buyer agents usually split commission, which is paid for by a home seller, many homebuyers do not pay their agents directly. Rather, sellers increase the price of their homes to compensate for the commission they pay the real estate agents.

In other countries, commissions on real estate transactions tend to be lower. In the UK, the average commission is 1.3%, in Australia, it is 2.5%.

""The decoupling of seller agent and buyer agent fees allows for a lot more flexibility and novelty in how agents are going to get paid,"" said Max Besbris, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The possibilities are more open now than ever before. We're really going to see, generally, a lot more transparency.""

Since buyer agents will be required to write up agreements with their clients, buyers will have more room to negotiate commissions with their agents, depending on what services they need from them. Some may opt for a flat-rate fee or pay their agent by the hour.

With the settlement upending the default relationship many buying agents have with their clients, homebuyers are going to have to become more savvy about what they can get from an agent and what services they are willing to pay for.

""It's going to take a lot more consumer information and education to know that there are alternatives and other kinds of fee structures,"" Besbris said.

Some buyer agents may still try to split commission with seller agents who advertise their commission on other platforms besides the MLS, but maintaining the practice will be harder for agents with the new rule.

It's unclear whether this change will have an impact on home prices, at least in the short-term. Experts agree that home prices won't be impacted any time soon.

While sellers could price their homes lower because they no longer shoulder the cost of the seller and buying agents, many buyers will still be paying for their own agent, just in a more direct way. Thus the overall cost of buying a home could remain the same.

But the settlement can empower buyers to negotiate how much they pay their agent, which could also lead to an overall lower cost of buying a home.

While it's unclear what changes the settlement will bring to home prices, experts agree that it will likely change who gets to continue working in the real estate industry.

The settlement will probably encourage buyers to become more invested in who they choose as their agent, as they will be paying them more directly, making it more competitive for buying agents to find clients.

Consumer advocates have argued that there is a glut of real estate agents working in the field, given the licensing process to become an agent is fairly simple. While there is demand for real estate agents with experience, some working in the field don't always work in good faith.

""It's very difficult to police this marketplace because the regulators have limited resources, and they're not fully committed to this. It's very difficult to see ethical and even legal violations,"" Brobeck said. ""A lot of this is just oral agreements between listing brokers, listing agents and buyer agents.""

The settlement could mean a ""more experienced pool of real estate agents and, ultimately, better service for more competitive prices"" for buyers, said Sonia Gilbukh, assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College.

""The high fixed fees that don't depend on experience is what kept a lot of people in the market. Even working with just one deal makes it worthwhile for people to stay,"" Gilbukh said.

The settlement comes out of a series class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued it was unfair they had to cover the commissions of buyer brokers.

The NAR agreed to pay $418m in damages and to change its commission rules to settle the suits.

In October, a federal jury had found the NAR guilty in on one of the suits, finding the organization and other residential brokerages liable for $1.78bn in damages for conspiring to artificially inflate commissions.

NAR has denied the price-fixing allegations. In a statement, NAR's interim CEO, Nykia Wright, said that the organization's goal is ""to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible"".

""This settlement achieves both of those goals,"" Wright said. While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR.""

That the settlement is expected to have such a widespread impact on real estate transactions shows just how much power NAR has over the industry, experts point out.

""It is a very big deal to see them take a loss,"" Bresbis said. ""They haven't really had to in the entirety of their existence, maybe since the New Deal.""

The group, which was founded in 1908, has $1bn in assets and has been a powerful lobbying arm for the real estate industry.

But the real estate industry has been going through intense changes over the last decade. Record-high home prices have left many homebuyers disgruntled by the market - a majority of renters in a recent Harris poll indicated that the American dream of buying a home is dead - and new technology has empowered buyers with more information about the market. Instead of relying solely on a broker, homebuyers can also turn to websites like Zillow or Redfin - both alternatives to the NAR's MLS - to try to find their home.

NAR's settlement shows how the organization, while still powerful in the real estate industry, is starting to wobble under these pressures.

""For so many decades, NAR was essentially the central organization in determining the shape of housing policy,"" Besbris said. ""To see them on the backfoot is a big shift in how much power they have.""",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1450980392156862,448972033,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/eb95b37ad115bc5f4fa4dd40d72fb5fc,

But why would you want a smart ring in the first place?

The short answer is that they are likely to fulfill the same health and activity tracking as a watch, leaving your wrist free for a more fashionable or traditional timepiece.

But they can also track your body's movements much more precisely than other wearable technology, and record detailed information about the movement of your hands.

This could allow you to control and interact with other technology in new ways -- but also raise even more concerns about privacy.

The Oura ring has been available since 2015 and one of us, Max, has been wearing one for more than five years.

He does this to track sleep and activity data during times when he does not want to wear a watch (including sleeping).

These rings track changes in your body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability (the time intervals between heart beats), blood oxygen levels, and physical activity. A smart watch can also do much of this.

It is expected that the Galaxy Ring will do the same (at least that is what one of their announcements focuses on), and be added to its health and fitness range.

Meanwhile, Apple's patent application indicates that its version may do more than monitor health. It may help control other devices, and vibrate to give users notifications.

Benefits all round?

Fingers are better than wrists at making specific gestures. With many more finger gesture options than arm positions, and finger gestures being the primary mode of interaction for VR (virtual reality) headsets, one probable future for smart rings is to control other devices. This would allow for the more precise detection of actions like pinching and pointing.

Multiple rings could work together to achieve this, with other devices.

Apple's ring patent, for example, implies that rings could be worn in different bands along the length of a single finger (not an uncommon choice with normal rings), allowing a company to know how your finger is angled.

If communicating with a watch, smart rings could detect finger and hand position in relation to your arm. This potentially provides more precise interactions with VR headsets.

In being able to carefully track fingers, rather than wrists, smart rings might allow technology companies to understand, model, and help improve many more activities, especially in situations where cameras and sensors are less likely to be found.

One example of this is learning to play classical guitar, which does not involve as much strumming with the whole arm or at the wrist, but where all the skill is in the fingers. Bringing sensors closer to the body's more dexterous touch sensors means that technology companies can more closely understand what you are doing.

Status symbols

Rings are jewelry, often worn to be seen. Apple is well known for making aesthetics a priority in its products.

While the Galaxy ring looks a lot like the Oura Ring, it's likely that Apple will consider the importance of personalization and style.

Rings are not just worn on fingers, of course. Could rings for piercings, that go inside the body to some extent, like those on our ears or lips, give us additional data on ourselves?

There might also be value in incorporating smart technology into other adornments. There are already smart products designed to be worn as necklaces. Potentially necklaces could help monitor stress levels because stress is closely linked to breathing patterns. There has also been a smart bra.

Rings signify attachment

The most well-known association that a ring has is as a gift of commitment and attachment. Researchers have looked at how we can use digital technology to communicate with loved ones who are not physically present. Apple's smart ring patent includes haptic feedback (where technology applies forces or vibrations to the user to simulate the experience of touch).

Smart wedding rings could be used to transmit messages between partners -- to let one of them know the other is thinking about them. For example, an interaction such as twisting the ring could make your partner's ring vibrate.

However, new smart devices will generate new forms of data and tracking, raising important questions about privacy and ethics.

As with other wearable technology, there may be things people do not want to track. Imagine a message from your workplace telling you: ""We see you aren't typing at your desk right now.""

Social problems are also a possibility. If smart technology was incorporated into wedding rings, it could give people a way of tracking what their partners were doing even more closely than smartphones can.

These questions highlight the importance of governments focusing on the responsible use of AI, as well as responsible innovation. Research shows that over half of British people (52%) feel like they do not know how their personal data is being collected and used.

Companies could create more targeted advertising based on changing circumstances, as when someone learns they are pregnant. Some regions of the world even offer cheaper life insurance to people with better health data from wearables.

What we should ask is: what is responsible and irresponsible for companies to track and try to infer about people from their wearables? This question should be at the forefront of thinking in the big tech companies.",knowridge.com,news,Knowridge Science Report,,0.2313725490196079,448972004,1,https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Smart-rings-ultra-precise-movement-tracking-take-wearable-technology-to-the-next-level.jpg,

Investments in India: India's economic landscape is rapidly evolving, with key policy changes and infrastructural advancements positioning the nation as an appealing investment hub, particularly in the financial technology sector. Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the World Economic Forum (WEF), stressed the significant role played by recent legislative reforms such as the bankruptcy law and taxation code, coupled with the development of the digital public infrastructure (DPI), in attracting investors to India.

In an interview with PTI, Blake highlighted India's exceptional performance in global markets, underscoring the profitability experienced by investors in the country. He noted that the proactive policy measures, notably the bankruptcy law and taxation code revisions, have fostered a conducive environment for investment, particularly in the burgeoning financial technology sector. The robust digital public infrastructure further solidifies India's position as a leading global market, with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a pivotal tool for enhancing personalisation and customisation within the industry.

AI is identified as a major driving force by 70 per cent of fintech CEOs surveyed by the WEF-Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, signalling its potential for revolutionising product and service offerings. Blake stressed the importance of AI adoption by sectoral regulators, particularly in the realm of risk management, emphasising the necessity for regulatory frameworks to evolve in tandem with technological advancements.

Acknowledging the proficiency of regulatory agencies in the Asia-Pacific region, Blake stressed the importance of knowledge exchange and collaboration to further enhance regulatory capabilities globally. He highlighted ongoing efforts to facilitate dialogue between financial service industry leaders and regulatory bodies to promote mutual understanding and alignment of objectives.

The WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth' echoed the sentiments of industry players, with a majority expressing confidence in the regulatory environment. Notably, 38 per cent of surveyed fintech companies cited regulatory support as a key factor contributing to their operational success and growth.

The location is in a parking garage on West 42nd Street in Manhattan, and it sports 24 charging stalls that can deliver a peak power rate of 500 kilowatts. That kind of power can add 200 miles of range in just five minutes or 2,400 miles across an hour of charging -- which would get you from New York to Phoenix.

We should mention that most EVs can't handle anywhere near a 500 kW rate while charging, and no current EV battery could go 2,400 miles on a single charge. However, that much power just means that your car will charge as fast as possible on these chargers, and the system is set up to handle advances in EV battery technology.

The new spot has on-site attendants seven days a week and a tap-and-pay interface with a convenient overhead charger cable setup.

At this point, Tesla's Supercharger network is the country's fastest, most expansive network. Charging times and range anxiety are two of the main reasons keeping people from switching to an EV, so adding more fast chargers that can have you in and out as quickly as a car filling up at a gas station is vital to continue the migration to electric vehicles.

LEADERSHIP Sunday gathered at the weekend that the intervention is in line with Governor Umo Eno's deliberate policy to increase agricultural production to enhance food sufficiency.

Performing the exercise at the Multiplication Seed Farm (MSF) at Ebighi Anwa community in Okobo local government area, the commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Offiong Offor said the focus of the administration centres on agricultural revolution, hence the gathering to commence the first planting season for the year.

""In the hierarchy of man's needs, food is ranked first and that explains why the governor has in many fora called on the people to go back to the farm. This occasion is timely to show the plan of government for the people,"" she stressed.

The commissioner, therefore, advised registered cooperative societies, farming groups, as well as individual farmers to visit the headquarters of their local government areas for farmers and groups verification exercise, in order to access government's agricultural interventions.

Besides, the commissioner assured the host community of government's continuous support, to reciprocate the cooperation so far accorded the Ministry.

The deputy governor, Senator Akon Eyakenyi, commended the governor for initiating model farms in the state to ensure food sufficiency.

Represented by the director of Administration, Mr Samuel Umium, Eyakenyi, appreciated the agriculture commissioner and her team for a great job, and assured them of support to ensure food sufficiency and availability in the state.

Call for Papers ∣ The 10th Deleuze and Guattari Studies in Asia Conference∣Technology and Life

As a supplement to human beings as ""animal manqué,"" technology has to be understood paradoxically as an ability developed due to the lack of appropriate innate bio-power. Ironically, human beings came to dominate the world precisely because he had this originary default. But technology in turn has proven to be a pharmakon which both improves human living and endangers the world. The extreme form of this pharmacological conundrum no doubt has been articulated by Heidegger and later taken up and modified by Bernard Stiegler.

What do Gilles Deleuze and Pierre-Félix Guattari have to say on technology, especially in view of the fact that AI, as an unforeseen game changer, seems to have forced our world into a phase where the above-mentioned pharmacological status of technology is tilting toward one end of the opposition? Taking into consideration recent posthumanist accounts of objects (often ramifications and further developments of Deleuze and Guattari's as well as Alfred Whitehead's thoughts) as having forces, autopoietic cybernetic traits, and even the ability to ""prehend,"" it may be surmised that the potential of technological objects, especially of AI, is yet to be fully fathomed. One testimony to this potential is the development of AI applications like ChatGPT and Sora. Furthermore, while the Anthropocene has seen the world turned upside down by humans mainly by means of technology, we may be entering a new phase aptly termed the ""Technocene"" where technology is not only multiplying its impact on the world but also is becoming autonomous of human control. And it seems less and less merely a SF fantasy that the moment of Singularity might materialize in an imaginable future.

Hence, we urgently need to treat technology both as subject-like objects and as machines. As objects, technological products have its bodily existence in both visible and invisible forms; as machines, they are embedded in the social networks. Both approaches have been proposed by Deleuze and Guattari and it remains for us to integrate them into a new and timely redefinition of technology.

And yet, a genuine integration of these two approaches is predicated on the Deleuzian concept of life. Timely acts of counter-actualization are required so that re-connections with the outside, and ultimately with the plane of immanence, the realm of differentiation or the virtual, is possible. It is thus only by making machines break down that we can be enabled to, as Deleuze and Guattari suggest, adopt a kind of existence ""closer to animals and rocks."" Only such an existence allows us to participate in what Deleuze and Guattari call ""aparallel evolution"" by becoming.

How then does technology bear on life? Are we able to forge a desirable block of becoming with technology? The principal question would be: would technology stifle the possibility of becoming, of counter-actualizing, or facilitate it? In other words, would it aggravate stratification or open up lines of flight? Most urgently, if the moment of Singularity is imminent, do we still have a window for thinking this ""or""? Therefore, now is the critical moment for reflecting on the meaning of technology. How to make technology a partner of humanity without obscuring or even cutting off the pulse of life is the greatest challenge for humanity at the present moment.

Eventually, phosphorus was implicated in the global environmental challenge of eutrophication. Now, we are on the brink of yet another emerging chapter in the story: global phosphorus scarcity linked to food security. Through a transdisciplinary and systemic inquiry, this thesis has analyzed, reconceptualized and synthesized the physical and institutional dimensions of global phosphorus scarcity in the context of food security, leading to a new framing, 'phosphorus security' to guide future work towards a more sustainable and food secure pathway.In a world which will be home to nine billion people by the middle of this century, producing enough food and other vital resources is likely to be a substantial challenge for humanity. Phosphorus, together with nitrogen and potassium, is an essential plant nutrient. It is applied to agricultural soils in fertilizers to maintain high crop yields. Phosphorus has no substitute in food production. Therefore, securing the long-term availability and accessibility of phosphorus is crucial to global food security. However the major source of phosphorus today, phosphate rock, is a non-renewable resource and high quality reserves are becoming increasingly scarce. This thesis estimates peak phosphorus to occur before 2035, after which demand will exceed supply. Phosphorus scarcity is defined by more than just physical scarcity of phosphate rock and this thesis develops five important dimensions. For example, there is a scarcity of management of phosphorus throughout the entire food production and consumption system: the global phosphorus flows analysis found that only 20% of phosphorus in phosphate rock mined for food production actually reaches the food consumed by the global population due to substantial inefficiencies and losses from mine to field to fork. There is also an economic scarcity, where for example, while all the world's farmers need access to sufficient fertilizers, only those with sufficient purchasing power can access fertilizer markets. Institutional scarcity, such as the lack of governance structures at the international level that explicitly aim to ensure long-term availability of and access to global phosphorus resources for food production that has led to ineffective and fragmented governance of phosphorus, including a lack of: overall coordination, monitoring and feedback, clear roles and responsibilities, long-term planning and equitable distribution. Finally, geopolitical scarcity arising from 90% of the world's remaining high-grade phosphate rock reserves being controlled by just five countries (a majority of which are subject to geopolitical tensions) can limit the availability of phosphorus on the market and raises serious ethical questions.The long-term future scenarios presented in this thesis indicate that meeting future global food demand will likely require a substantial reduction in the global demand for phosphorus through not only improved efficient use of phosphorus in agriculture, but also through changing diets and increasing efficiency in the food chain. The unavoidable demand for phosphorus could then be met through a high recovery and reuse rate of all sources of phosphorus (crop residues, food waste, manure, excreta) and other sources including some phosphate rock. A 'hard-landing' situation could involve further fertilizer price spikes, increased waste and pollution (including eutrophication), increased energy consumption associated with the production and trade of phosphorus fertilizers, reduced farmer access to phosphorus, reduced global crop yields and increased food insecurity. A preferred 'soft landing' situation will however require substantial changes to physical and institutional infrastructure, including improved governance structures at the global, national and other levels, such as new policies, partnerships and roles to bring together the food, fertilizer, agriculture, sanitation and waste sectors for a coordinated response.Finally, this thesis proposes a new global goal - phosphorus security - to be integrated in the dominant research discourses and policy debates on global food security and global environmental change. Among other criteria, phosphorus security requires that phosphorus use is decoupled from environmental degradation and that farmers' access to phosphorus is secured.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2784313725490195,448971662,1,,

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of buying or selling a home will look like.

Here's what we know about the settlement and what it could mean for the housing market in the US.

What's changing

Home sellers and buyers get their own agents, who are supposed to help them navigate the market. Most agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), paying dues to be a part of the organization of 1.5 million agents.

Being part of the NAR gives agents access to the organization's listings, known as ""multiple listing service"" or the MLS, where seller agents can post properties up for sale and where buying agents can see what homes are on the market.

Currently, the NAR has a rule that requires seller agents to include the commission that is being paid to sell the house. The standard rate ranges from 5% to 6%, meaning commission on the US average home at the end of 2023, $391,700, could reach up to $23,502. Though sellers are the ones that pay the commission, the compensation is usually split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent.

NAR has emphasized that the organization does not establish commission rates at 5% to 6% as a rule and that commissions are technically negotiable. Rather, the organization requires seller agents to list a commission, which is usually the standard rate.

As part of the settlement, NAR said it will no longer allow commission rates to be posted on its listings. The organization is also requiring buyer agents to have written agreements with buyers they work with.

Why this change is a big deal for homebuyers

Consumer advocates are praising the settlement as a step toward transparency in the home-buying marketplace.

""From a consumer standpoint, this is a complicated, opaque marketplace,"" said Steve Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America who has written extensively about the real estate industry. After the settlement, the marketplace ""will become a little less opaque"".

The settlement could ultimately change what is baked into the sale price of a home, making clear to buyers exactly what they are paying for.

Because seller agents and buyer agents usually split commission, which is paid for by a home seller, many homebuyers do not pay their agents directly. Rather, sellers increase the price of their homes to compensate for the commission they pay the real estate agents.

In other countries, commissions on real estate transactions tend to be lower. In the UK, the average commission is 1.3%, in Australia, it is 2.5%.

""The decoupling of seller agent and buyer agent fees allows for a lot more flexibility and novelty in how agents are going to get paid,"" said Max Besbris, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The possibilities are more open now than ever before. We're really going to see, generally, a lot more transparency.""

Since buyer agents will be required to write up agreements with their clients, buyers will have more room to negotiate commissions with their agents, depending on what services they need from them. Some may opt for a flat-rate fee or pay their agent by the hour.

With the settlement upending the default relationship many buying agents have with their clients, homebuyers are going to have to become more savvy about what they can get from an agent and what services they are willing to pay for.

""It's going to take a lot more consumer information and education to know that there are alternatives and other kinds of fee structures,"" Besbris said.

Some buyer agents may still try to split commission with seller agents who advertise their commission on other platforms besides the MLS, but maintaining the practice will be harder for agents with the new rule.

Will this bring home prices down?

It's unclear whether this change will have an impact on home prices, at least in the short-term. Experts agree that home prices won't be impacted any time soon.

While sellers could price their homes lower because they no longer shoulder the cost of the seller and buying agents, many buyers will still be paying for their own agent, just in a more direct way. Thus the overall cost of buying a home could remain the same.

But the settlement can empower buyers to negotiate how much they pay their agent, which could also lead to an overall lower cost of buying a home.

A more transparent marketplace

While it's unclear what changes the settlement will bring to home prices, experts agree that it will likely change who gets to continue working in the real estate industry.

The settlement will probably encourage buyers to become more invested in who they choose as their agent, as they will be paying them more directly, making it more competitive for buying agents to find clients.

Consumer advocates have argued that there is a glut of real estate agents working in the field, given the licensing process to become an agent is fairly simple. While there is demand for real estate agents with experience, some working in the field don't always work in good faith.

""It's very difficult to police this marketplace because the regulators have limited resources, and they're not fully committed to this. It's very difficult to see ethical and even legal violations,"" Brobeck said. ""A lot of this is just oral agreements between listing brokers, listing agents and buyer agents.""

The settlement could mean a ""more experienced pool of real estate agents and, ultimately, better service for more competitive prices"" for buyers, said Sonia Gilbukh, assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College.

""The high fixed fees that don't depend on experience is what kept a lot of people in the market. Even working with just one deal makes it worthwhile for people to stay,"" Gilbukh said.

What prompted the settlement

The settlement comes out of a series class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued it was unfair they had to cover the commissions of buyer brokers.

The NAR agreed to pay $418m in damages and to change its commission rules to settle the suits.

In October, a federal jury had found the NAR guilty in on one of the suits, finding the organization and other residential brokerages liable for $1.78bn in damages for conspiring to artificially inflate commissions.

NAR has denied the price-fixing allegations. In a statement, NAR's interim CEO, Nykia Wright, said that the organization's goal is ""to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible"".

""This settlement achieves both of those goals,"" Wright said. While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR.""

A powerful industry group heels

That the settlement is expected to have such a widespread impact on real estate transactions shows just how much power NAR has over the industry, experts point out.

""It is a very big deal to see them take a loss,"" Bresbis said. ""They haven't really had to in the entirety of their existence, maybe since the New Deal.""

The group, which was founded in 1908, has $1bn in assets and has been a powerful lobbying arm for the real estate industry.

But the real estate industry has been going through intense changes over the last decade. Record-high home prices have left many homebuyers disgruntled by the market - a majority of renters in a recent Harris poll indicated that the American dream of buying a home is dead - and new technology has empowered buyers with more information about the market. Instead of relying solely on a broker, homebuyers can also turn to websites like Zillow or Redfin - both alternatives to the NAR's MLS - to try to find their home.

NAR's settlement shows how the organization, while still powerful in the real estate industry, is starting to wobble under these pressures.

""For so many decades, NAR was essentially the central organization in determining the shape of housing policy,"" Besbris said. ""To see them on the backfoot is a big shift in how much power they have.""",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,,0.1764705882352942,448971605,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/eb95b37ad115bc5f4fa4dd40d72fb5fc,eng-9420431

Chinese policymakers have so far resisted calls to juice the economy through massive government stimulus, instead stressing the need to pivot towards ""high-quality"" growth.

Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing today, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"".

The Bulgarian economist warned that ""this transformation would not be easy"", but argued that ""with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario"", according to an official transcript of her speech.

Beijing should take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the amount of unfinished housing and give more space for ""market-based corrections"" in the crucial but heavily indebted real-estate sector, Georgieva said.

Authorities should also boost ""the spending power of individuals and families"" by beefing up China's pension system and taking other steps to hone its vast social security apparatus, she added.

Georgieva also pushed China to strengthen ""the business environment and (ensure) a level playing field between private and state-owned enterprises"", a long-standing demand of overseas business groups operating in the Asian nation.

Top Chinese politicians have been outwardly bullish on the economy, with Premier Li Qiang telling Sunday's forum that Beijing would ""take practical, effective actions to promote high-quality development and inject positive energy... into the global economic recovery"".

But GDP growth rates in China have been trending downward for years, and Beijing this month set an annual target of ""around five percent"" -- significantly lower than the breakneck expansion rates that powered the country's meteoric rise to prosperity.

Sunday's forum was attended by some of the world's highest-profile business figures, including Apple's Tim Cook.

A state agency directing Hawaii energy policy in areas including security, resiliency and environmental health is at risk of losing its independence.

State senators recently sent the House of Representatives a bill to turn the Hawaii State Energy Office into a division of the state Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.

The introduction and advancement of Senate Bill 3282 follows displeasure with the Energy Office in recent years from some of the bill's introducers, and comes four years after the Legislature reorganized the agency to improve its focus and achievements in part by converting it from a DBEDT division to an agency with a Cabinet-level director.

In addition to folding the Energy Office into DBEDT, SB 3282 would change the office's leader to an administrator appointed by DBEDT's director instead of an appointee of the governor.

Mark Glick, who was appointed to lead the agency in 2023 by Gov. Josh Green and was the office's leader from 2011 to 2016 under two prior governors when the office was a DBEDT division, suggested in written testimony on the bill that the proposed changes would hurt agency work.

""HSEO suggests that the Legislature reversing its course in SB 3282 would be a distraction from the important work conducted by the energy office,"" he said. ""Furthermore, DBEDT is such a diverse and multifaceted department given the growth of its responsibilities over the years -- it would be detrimental to treat the energy sector as 'just another issue' under DBEDT's portfolio.""

Currently, the Energy Office is one of about 10 agencies that have independent authority but are attached to DBEDT only for administrative support. Other such agencies include the Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Community Development Authority, the Hawaii Technology Development Corp. and the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corp.

DBEDT has several divisions doing work in areas that include economic research, business development support, foreign trade zone administration and support for creative industries that include the film industry. The Energy Office had been a division until a 2019 change directed by the Legislature.

Glick in his written testimony on SB 3282 highlighted Energy Office achievements, including plans to drill test wells for exploring geothermal energy resources on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii island, production of a decarbonization strategy, and recent completion of an Oahu energy system and critical infrastructure vulnerability and resiliency assessment.

Glick also said the agency is studying options for replacing low-sulfur fuel oil and lower-efficiency power generation to mitigate oil price volatility and reduce electricity rates and carbon dioxide emissions, and expects to soon apply for federal energy efficiency rebate grants that include $250 million for a statewide sensor-based system to shut off power for compromised electric transmission and distribution lines during wildfires.

""Given the productivity of the Energy Office under the direction of Gov. Green, the fundamental question in considering SB 3282 may be, 'If it is not broke, why fix it?' "" Glick wrote.

The Energy Office also oversees the state's goal of deriving 100% of energy from renewable sources by 2045, for which some lawmakers who support SB 3282 have criticized the agency.

Some of that criticism relates to utility-scale solar farm projects that have been delayed or canceled by developers over cost or material supply issues under contracts with Hawaiian Electric Co. and approved by the state Public Utilities Commission; the PUC's rejection of a biomass power plant project called Hu Honua on Hawaii island; and the shutdown of a coal-fired AES Corp. power plant on Oahu in 2022, which was endorsed by the Legislature.

Part of SB 3282 would have the proposed new DBEDT division develop a state energy plan that includes strategies and actions for one-, five-, 10- and 15-year forecasts for the annual achievement of state energy policy goals.

DBEDT didn't submit testimony on SB 3282, though Deputy Director Dane Wicker said in response to a question at a Feb. 8 hearing on the bill that DBEDT can work with divisions more quickly to develop strategic plans compared with attached agencies that sometimes have their own boards of directors, though the Energy Office doesn't have a board.

Glick said at the same hearing, held by the Senate Committee on Energy, Economic Development and Tourism, that the Energy Office already works closely with DBEDT.

The committee advanced the bill in a 5-0 vote led by Sens. Lynn DeCoite (D, East and Upcountry Maui-Molokai-Lanai) and Glenn Wakai (D, Kalihi-Salt Lake-Pearl Harbor), who are chair and vice chair, respectively, and were co-introducers of the bill.

The bill's lead introducer is Sen. Donovan Dela Cruz, who said the Energy Office lacks oversight by DBEDT.

Dela Cruz (D, Mililani-Wahiawa-Whitmore Village) chairs the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which advanced the bill in a 11-0 vote Feb. 23.

At the Ways and Means hearing, Dela Cruz noted his intention to tie the Energy Office's base budget from state general funds for next fiscal year to SB 3282 instead of the main state budget bill that typically provides agencies with funding for basic operations that include staff payroll.

Glick noted that the Energy Office's base budget for next fiscal year was approved last year, and that trying to tie the agency's budget to an organizational overhaul is terrible on principal.

""It's not consistent with budget principals of state agencies,"" he said in an interview. ""That's a terrible practice.""

Dela Cruz said SB 3282 aims to restructure the office, so its funding was put into the bill.

A 25-0 vote by the full Senate on March 5 sent the bill to the House for consideration.

Tel Aviv [Israel], March 24 (ANI/TPS): In a groundbreaking effort to combat the problem of contaminants and pharmaceutical waste in drinking water, Israeli researchers unveiled a nanofilter designed to specifically detect harmful molecular residue in water.

The findings on the filter, developed by researchers at Bar-Ilan University, were presented in the peer-reviewed journal, Environmental Science: Nano.

The filter, a highly sensitive plasmonic-based detector, was designed specifically to detect harmful piperidine molecular residue in water.

Piperidine and its derivatives have various applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Piperidine's versatility makes it used as a building block in organic synthesis to create more complex molecules and is commonly used to treat a wide range of medical conditions. It is also used in various chemicals, including dyes, pesticides, flavours, and fragrances, as well as treating metal to protect it from corrosion.

However, piperidine can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in high concentrations. It can also react with other chemicals to produce hazardous by-products. Improper disposal of piperidine can contaminate soil, water or air. Detecting even trace amounts of piperidine is imperative for safeguarding drinking water and food safety.

The nanofilter features triangular cavities etched in a silver thin film, shielded by a 5-nanometer layer of silicon dioxide, offering unparalleled sensitivity to piperidine by detecting low concentrations in water.

The development of this dime-sized device was spearheaded by Mohamed Hamode, a Ph.D. student at Bar-Ilan's Department of Chemistry, in collaboration with Dr. Elad Segal. Employing a focused ion microscope, Hamode meticulously drilled nanometer-sized holes onto a metal surface, utilising a custom-built computer programme to shape the holes.

The minute apertures, smaller than the wavelength of visible light, intensify the electrical field on the surface, resulting in concentrated light in extremely confined areas. This amplification allows for the detection of low concentrations of molecules that were previously undetectable with optical probes.

The plasmonic substrate, characterized by its confined and enhanced electromagnetic field, presents an efficient alternative to existing substrates utilized in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). This breakthrough opens avenues for the utilization of cost-effective and portable Raman devices, facilitating quicker and more affordable analysis.

""By harnessing nano-patterned metallic surfaces, we have demonstrated the detection of low concentrations of piperidine in water using affordable optics, offering a promising solution for environmental analytical setups,"" said lead researcher Prof. Adi Salomon.(ANI/TPS)

Constructivist grounded theory and situational analysis were used to examine the information activities of 26 English-speakers from Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Students were learning one of eight languages in 14 different American, Asian and European countries for a period of between four and 12 months overseas. Semi-structured interviews and photoelicitation method were used to give each participant the opportunity to present an explanatory narrative of their time overseas and to explicate nuanced and contextual information that is hard to verbalise. The study is informed by a theoretical framework that includes practice theory and transitions theory. The theory of mitigating risk emerges from the study's analysis and provides a rich explanation of how an engagement with information supports language-student transition to new and culturally unfamiliar information environments. The theory illustrates how academic, physical and financial stress that is produced through participation within a new setting catalyses the enactment of information literacy practices that subsequently mediate student transition from acting like a language-learner to becoming a language-learner during their time overseas. From an educational perspective, the theory of mitigating risk broadens understanding about the shape that information literacy takes within transition to a new intercultural context while setting the scene for the design of educational interventions that recognise the fluid and generative possibilities of this period.

University of Queensland researchers have used dosing software to accelerate the effects of antibiotics in patients being treated for sepsis in Intensive Care Units.

Co-senior study author Professor Jason Roberts from UQ's Centre for Clinical Research said the technique trialed in the DIRECT study meant patients received effective antibiotics in half the usual time, leading to faster recovery, higher quality care, cost savings and increased bed availability in the hospitals.

""We found we could dramatically improve the accuracy and quality of the treatment provided to adults and children, meaning less time in the ICU and a faster cure,"" Professor Roberts said.

""We did this by rapidly identifying which bacteria was causing their severe infection, and then applying a personalized dosing approach to ensure each patient received the most effective dose for their needs.

""The team used Bayesian dosing software in four adult and pediatric ICUs, leading to an estimated healthcare saving of $12,000 per patient in some groups.""

The clinical trial was unusual because it included children and involved collaborators at four major Brisbane hospitals.

UQCCR Principal Research Fellow and co-senior author Associate Professor Adam Irwin said improving the accuracy of infection treatment was a great outcome.

""In this study, clinicians in pediatric and adult intensive care settings alike were confident to apply the dosing software recommendations, meaning critically ill children and adults will benefit from the results,"" Dr Irwin said.

We had ICU doctors and nurses, pharmacists, infectious diseases doctors, microbiologists and experts in health economics involved in the study.

This research highlights our strong commitment to providing the best possible care for Queenslanders.

We hope that further funding will allow us to demonstrate the value of this treatment approach to a broader international audience.""

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of buying or selling a home will look like.

Here's what we know about the settlement and what it could mean for the housing market in the US.

Home sellers and buyers get their own agents, who are supposed to help them navigate the market. Most agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), paying dues to be a part of the organization of 1.5 million agents.

Being part of the NAR gives agents access to the organization's listings, known as ""multiple listing service"" or the MLS, where seller agents can post properties up for sale and where buying agents can see what homes are on the market.

Currently, the NAR has a rule that requires seller agents to include the commission that is being paid to sell the house. The standard rate ranges from 5% to 6%, meaning commission on the US average home at the end of 2023, $391,700, could reach up to $23,502. Though sellers are the ones that pay the commission, the compensation is usually split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent.

NAR has emphasized that the organization does not establish commission rates at 5% to 6% as a rule and that commissions are technically negotiable. Rather, the organization requires seller agents to list a commission, which is usually the standard rate.

As part of the settlement, NAR said it will no longer allow commission rates to be posted on its listings. The organization is also requiring buyer agents to have written agreements with buyers they work with.

Consumer advocates are praising the settlement as a step toward transparency in the home-buying marketplace.

""From a consumer standpoint, this is a complicated, opaque marketplace,"" said Steve Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America who has written extensively about the real estate industry. After the settlement, the marketplace ""will become a little less opaque"".

The settlement could ultimately change what is baked into the sale price of a home, making clear to buyers exactly what they are paying for.

Because seller agents and buyer agents usually split commission, which is paid for by a home seller, many homebuyers do not pay their agents directly. Rather, sellers increase the price of their homes to compensate for the commission they pay the real estate agents.

In other countries, commissions on real estate transactions tend to be lower. In the UK, the average commission is 1.3%, in Australia, it is 2.5%.

""The decoupling of seller agent and buyer agent fees allows for a lot more flexibility and novelty in how agents are going to get paid,"" said Max Besbris, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The possibilities are more open now than ever before. We're really going to see, generally, a lot more transparency.""

Since buyer agents will be required to write up agreements with their clients, buyers will have more room to negotiate commissions with their agents, depending on what services they need from them. Some may opt for a flat-rate fee or pay their agent by the hour.

With the settlement upending the default relationship many buying agents have with their clients, homebuyers are going to have to become more savvy about what they can get from an agent and what services they are willing to pay for.

""It's going to take a lot more consumer information and education to know that there are alternatives and other kinds of fee structures,"" Besbris said.

Some buyer agents may still try to split commission with seller agents who advertise their commission on other platforms besides the MLS, but maintaining the practice will be harder for agents with the new rule.

It's unclear whether this change will have an impact on home prices, at least in the short-term. Experts agree that home prices won't be impacted any time soon.

While sellers could price their homes lower because they no longer shoulder the cost of the seller and buying agents, many buyers will still be paying for their own agent, just in a more direct way. Thus the overall cost of buying a home could remain the same.

But the settlement can empower buyers to negotiate how much they pay their agent, which could also lead to an overall lower cost of buying a home.

While it's unclear what changes the settlement will bring to home prices, experts agree that it will likely change who gets to continue working in the real estate industry.

The settlement will probably encourage buyers to become more invested in who they choose as their agent, as they will be paying them more directly, making it more competitive for buying agents to find clients.

Consumer advocates have argued that there is a glut of real estate agents working in the field, given the licensing process to become an agent is fairly simple. While there is demand for real estate agents with experience, some working in the field don't always work in good faith.

""It's very difficult to police this marketplace because the regulators have limited resources, and they're not fully committed to this. It's very difficult to see ethical and even legal violations,"" Brobeck said. ""A lot of this is just oral agreements between listing brokers, listing agents and buyer agents.""

The settlement could mean a ""more experienced pool of real estate agents and, ultimately, better service for more competitive prices"" for buyers, said Sonia Gilbukh, assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College.

""The high fixed fees that don't depend on experience is what kept a lot of people in the market. Even working with just one deal makes it worthwhile for people to stay,"" Gilbukh said.

The settlement comes out of a series class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued it was unfair they had to cover the commissions of buyer brokers.

The NAR agreed to pay $418m in damages and to change its commission rules to settle the suits.

In October, a federal jury had found the NAR guilty in on one of the suits, finding the organization and other residential brokerages liable for $1.78bn in damages for conspiring to artificially inflate commissions.

NAR has denied the price-fixing allegations. In a statement, NAR's interim CEO, Nykia Wright, said that the organization's goal is ""to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible"".

""This settlement achieves both of those goals,"" Wright said. While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR.""

That the settlement is expected to have such a widespread impact on real estate transactions shows just how much power NAR has over the industry, experts point out.

""It is a very big deal to see them take a loss,"" Bresbis said. ""They haven't really had to in the entirety of their existence, maybe since the New Deal.""

The group, which was founded in 1908, has $1bn in assets and has been a powerful lobbying arm for the real estate industry.

But the real estate industry has been going through intense changes over the last decade. Record-high home prices have left many homebuyers disgruntled by the market - a majority of renters in a recent Harris poll indicated that the American dream of buying a home is dead - and new technology has empowered buyers with more information about the market. Instead of relying solely on a broker, homebuyers can also turn to websites like Zillow or Redfin - both alternatives to the NAR's MLS - to try to find their home.

NAR's settlement shows how the organization, while still powerful in the real estate industry, is starting to wobble under these pressures.

""For so many decades, NAR was essentially the central organization in determining the shape of housing policy,"" Besbris said. ""To see them on the backfoot is a big shift in how much power they have.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1450980392156862,448971046,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_guardian_765/eb95b37ad115bc5f4fa4dd40d72fb5fc,eng-9420431

The index declined 36% before reaching its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But the recession many economists expected has yet to materialize. Instead, economic growth accelerated last year, and many stocks rebounded sharply, helped along by cooling inflation and excitement about artificial intelligence.

The Nasdaq finally reached a new record high on Feb. 29, 2024. Crossing that threshold made the new bull market official, a development that has historically portended substantial gains for investors. Specifically, the Nasdaq has only been through eight other bull markets since 1990, and the index has generally moved much higher during those periods.

Read on to learn more.

Some investors use the term bull market loosely, often to describe a substantial gain following a recent low. But other investors subscribe to a more precise definition, which stipulates that two things must happen for a bull market to occur:

What makes that definition tricky is the timing. A bull market technically begins when an index reaches its bear market low, but it does not become official until it reaches a record high. For instance, the current Nasdaq Composite bull market started when the index reached its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But it was not official until 14 months later, when the index reached a new high on Feb. 29, 2024.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq has experienced eight complete bull markets since 1990. The table below provides details on each of those events.

Data source: YCharts. Note: Percentages and averages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

As shown above, the Nasdaq returned an average 215% during the eight bull markets that have taken place since 1990, and it realized those returns over an average of 1,223 days (about 40 months). Put differently, the Nasdaq returned about 41% annually during past bull markets. We can use that information to make a somewhat educated guess about the future.

Specifically, the Nasdaq has advanced 58% since the current bull market began about 15 months ago. That leaves implied upside of 157% over the next 25 months. In other words, the Nasdaq should return 57% annually through April 2026 if its performance aligns with the historical average. I call that a somewhat educated guess because past bull markets have varied greatly in terms of returns and duration, which means there is a great deal of uncertainty baked into my estimate.

Ultimately, the economic climate plays a major role in how the index performs over any period, and past performance never guarantees future results. For instance, the current bull market follows a pandemic that pushed U.S. inflation to its highest level since 1981. That prompted the Federal Reserve to embark on its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in decades. Those events could impact the economy for years to come, so the current bull market may not follow the historical pattern.

In fact, I would be surprised if the Nasdaq returned anything close to 157% over the next 25 months. I say that because the S&P 500, the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, currently trades at 25.6 times earnings. That is a significant premium to the 10-year average of 21.2 times earnings, indicating that many stocks have historically expensive valuations.

Predicting the future performance of the stock market is impossible, but some forecasting methods are better than others. In most cases, rather than focusing on specific events like bull markets, it makes more sense to consider performance across all market environments. That strategy should yield more reliable results simply because it accounts for more data points.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq Composite has increased 3,500% since 1990, compounding at an annual rate of 11%. That period covers a broad enough range of economic climates that similar returns are likely in the future. That does not mean the index will return 11% every year, but rather that its average return will land somewhere around 11% per year over the next three or four decades.

Investors can capitalize on that data by purchasing an index fund that tracks the Nasdaq Composite. Alternatively, given the technology-heavy nature of the index, investors could also benefit from adding some technology stocks to their portfolios. That is especially true of companies in fast-growing markets like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and robotic process automation.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Trevor Jennewine,0.09019607843137245,448970935,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770090/growth-4.jpg,

Its weekly Sentiment Survey tracks the pulse of short-term optimism on the U.S. stock market in the individual investor community. The goal is to provide a forward-looking perspective by asking their thoughts on the stock market over the next six months.

In the latest survey, 43.2% of investors state they are ""bullish"" -- a Wall Street term that denotes optimism. This means investors believe the stock market will continue to rise over the next six months. This is above the survey's historical average of 37.5%.

Conversely, 27.2% of investors are ""bearish"" and believe the stock market will decline over the next six months, a near four-month high. This is up markedly from the 21.9% reported just last week. Meanwhile, 29.6% of respondents stated they were ""neutral"" -- that the stock market would remain relatively unchanged over the next six months.

If you've always wondered about Wall Street's fascination with bulls and bears and their frame of reference, here's an easy hint. Bulls charge forward (a rising stock market) and bears lie down to hibernate (a declining stock market).

The latest Sentiment Survey indicates that, overall, investors are still optimistic on the short-term outlook of the U.S. stock market. However, the rising ""bearish"" outlook indicates a growing concern that stock prices over the past 16 months might have risen a bit too high, too fast.

The survey also reflects the rollercoaster-type ride investors have experienced over the past few years. In 2022, concerns over high inflation and rising interest rates sent the major stock market indexes into decline. That year, the tech-heavy NASDAQ fell the most, declining by 33.1%. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 19.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 8.8%. By December 2022, the AAII reported investor bullish sentiment had cratered to just 20.3%. Bearish sentiment, however, soared to 52.3%.

But 2023 provided a much-needed boost to investors. Last year, the NASDAQ soared 43.4%, the S&P 500 gained 24.2% while the DJIA rose 13.7%. So far in 2024, all three stock market indexes have continued their upward rise and currently stand at all-time record highs.

Whether the ongoing rise in the stock market continues or not is unknown. That's the realm of crystal balls. Based on the latest Sentiment Survey, many investors think it will. But that optimism is increasingly being tempered by a dose of caution. The economy is still facing high inflation and high interest rates. This is a potent combination that can potentially throw a wrench into the growth of the economy and the U.S. stock market.

VW and BMW focus on a DC solution, and Renault focuses on AC. So, where is the journey heading? Jan Figgener, one of the heads of the Vehicle-to-grid, Vehicle-to-home and Smart Charging conference, gives an outlook.

The advantages of bidirectional charging are apparent. At home, electricity from an electric car battery can be used to power electrical appliances - not only in the event of a power cut but also in the evening, for example, after the electric car has been charged with solar power from your home solar power system during the day. If you don't use the electricity yourself but feed it into the grid, it stabilises the latter, reducing the costs for the necessary grid expansion and generating passive income.

What was already announced as a dream scenario with the first electric cars is now becoming a reality. It is a step the automotive industry cannot take alone - power companies and grid operators are also instrumental in the development and implementation.

On 10 and 11 April, the Vehicle-to-grid, Vehicle-to-home and Smart Charging conference will take place in Münster in cooperation with Haus der Technik - with presentations, discussions and professional exchanges on the sidelines. We spoke to Jan Figgener, one of the conference organisers.

Many pilot projects have already proven the technical feasibility of vehicle-to-grid and bidirectional charging in general - so it works. However, the breakthrough in series production vehicles has yet to come. Is there a need for more legal framework? Or has the automotive industry not yet focused on V2G because they had other priorities for their first electric cars?

Indeed, the market launch took a little longer than many would have liked. Nevertheless, the first offers from car manufacturers and aggregators have been available since this year, and many other solutions and collaborations have been announced for the near future. The step into series production is, therefore, happening right now. On the one hand, some technical challenges had and still have to be solved because mobility and energy are still too often thought of separately. However, the first solutions in this respect are already promising, and many innovative companies are developing them further.

On the other hand, we see several different problems at the regulatory level. For example, differing registration processes and various technical requirements of grid operators make it difficult to scale the technology. There is also still a difference in levies and charges between a home storage system and a bidirectional car, which has a major impact on some business models. However, we are optimistic about the future because manufacturers, politicians and grid operators are actively working on solutions.

Is vehicle-to-grid moving towards AC solutions in which the car feeds alternating current back into the grid? DC solutions could be more suitable for vehicle-to-home, to integrate the electric car battery into one's own microgrid with a photovoltaic system and home storage.

While a few years ago, a lot of solutions were still based on DC, we are now seeing more and more AC solutions. AC is the obvious solution, especially for smart charging, and the step towards bidirectional charging is an obvious one.

I would also assess the question of AC vs DC independently of the application. Two things are essential for vehicle-to-home: the vehicles must have very low standby consumption and, at the same time, discharge efficiently at lower power. If I have several hundred watts of power loss in some of today's vehicles, I cannot sensibly supply a household that also consumes a few hundred watts. We therefore need cars with very low standby losses of just a few watts and new inverters. Whether these inverters are in the car or the charging station and whether we are talking about AC or DC charging is ultimately irrelevant.

What effects does bidirectional charging have on the battery, regardless of whether it is fed into the grid or your own home? Does it age faster due to the additional charging cycles? Or what are the challenges for the battery cell and battery management?

The loads vary depending on the application, but the all-clear can generally be given. Batteries age chronologically (even without operation) and cyclically (active charging and discharging). High states of charge and temperatures lead to accelerated calendar ageing, while high charging currents and high cycle depths lead to accelerated cyclical ageing.

The following happens with bidirectional integration: In most applications, the average state of charge decreases compared to the usual full charge after arrival, extending the calendar service life. At the same time, cyclical ageing increases due to the additional energy throughput. However, this ageing only has a minor impact on the service life because most cycle depths are minimal, and the vehicles are generally designed for significantly more cycles than are required for mobility. We mainly see such small cycle depths when supplying the household with energy and frequency stabilisation.

The situation can be different when supplying a high-consumption commercial operation or in electricity market trading, where the revenue comes from the energy throughput. Such applications can lead to many additional cycles with high cycle depths, during which accelerated ageing can occur. Here, we need operating strategies to prevent premature ageing of the battery, but this is possible with modern analytics and good energy management systems. In many cases, the vehicle's power electronics must also remain switched on. That leads to several thousand operating hours per year, which can be challenging for today's models but is not a general obstacle to future bidirectional vehicle integration.

And what about network operators and charging infrastructure operators? What hurdles do they have to take?

In Germany, we have network operators of very different sizes. Smaller operators, in particular, quickly reach their limits in terms of personnel with all the changes in the energy world. After all, storage systems, solar energy systems, heat pumps and even electric cars are added to the mix. We need standardised processes so that all players have a uniform interface. The role of service providers will thus continue to grow, especially for smaller grid operators. We are actually very optimistic about charging infrastructure operators, as many companies have been working on this topic for a long time. However, the focus will initially be on the private sector, as regulation is even more challenging in the public sector.

Refuelling was easy for the customer. Charging at their own wallbox is, too, as long as the electricity only flows from the grid into the battery. How can vehicle-to-grid be made as simple as possible for the customer? And what is needed in the background - in terms of system integration?

To help vehicle-to-grid become mainstream, everything has to be as simple as possible. The vehicle or charging station must decide for itself when to charge and discharge, taking into account the mobility needs of the owner.

Technology enthusiasts may look at a daily price curve and optimise their behaviour accordingly. Still, the real goal is for users not even to notice that their vehicle is charging and discharging intelligently. The difference is then particularly noticeable in the wallet, as the additional vehicle usage generates revenue that can amount to several hundred euros per year. Nowadays, this requires a control logic and a corresponding electricity contract.

Representatives from the German National Charging Infrastructure Control Centre, numerous hardware and software providers, and the research sector will speak at the conference. What do you expect from the conference? What will be the most important topics - on stage and in the discussions around it?

The conference is always characterised by a very open exchange, where solutions and challenges are presented. The focus is currently very clearly on companies that are leaders in the field and are now presenting the first large-scale market solutions in addition to many pilot projects. It increases the players' understanding of each other's problems and allows them to work together on a solution. But critical discussions are also the order of the day. Last time, for example, we discussed the complexity of the entire communication chain, estimates of revenue potential, the competition between AC vs. DC and, of course, regulatory obstacles.

The scheduled discussion slots, as well as the breaks and, of course, the well-attended evening event, are ideal for this.

Among the ongoing projects are the comprehensive management project for the desert in western Inner Mongolia's Alshaa League (phase II), the construction of the ""Photovoltaic Great Wall"" in the Kubuqi Desert in Ordos City, and a project to eliminate the Hunshandake Desert in Xilingol League.

New energy utilization projects are also under construction in Chifeng City.

The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program is a large-scale afforestation and ecological project involving the northwest, north and northeast regions of China, spanning from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the west to Heilongjiang Province in the east.

According to the plan, the program's construction scope covers 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, with a total construction area of 4.07 million square kilometers.

This year, Inner Mongolia plans to plant over 200,000 hectares of trees, along with over 866,667 hectares of grass, and treat over 1 million hectares of desertified and sandy land.

A major shift in how Americans buy homes could come this summer after a powerful real estate group settled an antitrust lawsuit, agreeing to change a rule that dictates how real estate agents are compensated.

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of buying or selling a home will look like.

Here's what we know about the settlement and what it could mean for the housing market in the US.

Home sellers and buyers get their own agents, who are supposed to help them navigate the market. Most agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), paying dues to be a part of the organization of 1.5 million agents.

Being part of the NAR gives agents access to the organization's listings, known as ""multiple listing service"" or the MLS, where seller agents can post properties up for sale and where buying agents can see what homes are on the market.

Currently, the NAR has a rule that requires seller agents to include the commission that is being paid to sell the house. The standard rate ranges from 5% to 6%, meaning commission on the US average home at the end of 2023, $391,700, could reach up to $23,502. Though sellers are the ones that pay the commission, the compensation is usually split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent.

NAR has emphasized that the organization does not establish commission rates at 5% to 6% as a rule and that commissions are technically negotiable. Rather, the organization requires seller agents to list a commission, which is usually the standard rate.

As part of the settlement, NAR said it will no longer allow commission rates to be posted on its listings. The organization is also requiring buyer agents to have written agreements with buyers they work with.

Consumer advocates are praising the settlement as a step toward transparency in the home-buying marketplace.

""From a consumer standpoint, this is a complicated, opaque marketplace,"" said Steve Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America who has written extensively about the real estate industry. After the settlement, the marketplace ""will become a little less opaque"".

The settlement could ultimately change what is baked into the sale price of a home, making clear to buyers exactly what they are paying for.

Because seller agents and buyer agents usually split commission, which is paid for by a home seller, many homebuyers do not pay their agents directly. Rather, sellers increase the price of their homes to compensate for the commission they pay the real estate agents.

In other countries, commissions on real estate transactions tend to be lower. In the UK, the average commission is 1.3%, in Australia, it is 2.5%.

""The decoupling of seller agent and buyer agent fees allows for a lot more flexibility and novelty in how agents are going to get paid,"" said Max Besbris, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The possibilities are more open now than ever before. We're really going to see, generally, a lot more transparency.""

Since buyer agents will be required to write up agreements with their clients, buyers will have more room to negotiate commissions with their agents, depending on what services they need from them. Some may opt for a flat-rate fee or pay their agent by the hour.

With the settlement upending the default relationship many buying agents have with their clients, homebuyers are going to have to become more savvy about what they can get from an agent and what services they are willing to pay for.

""It's going to take a lot more consumer information and education to know that there are alternatives and other kinds of fee structures,"" Besbris said.

Some buyer agents may still try to split commission with seller agents who advertise their commission on other platforms besides the MLS, but maintaining the practice will be harder for agents with the new rule.

It's unclear whether this change will have an impact on home prices, at least in the short-term. Experts agree that home prices won't be impacted any time soon.

While sellers could price their homes lower because they no longer shoulder the cost of the seller and buying agents, many buyers will still be paying for their own agent, just in a more direct way. Thus the overall cost of buying a home could remain the same.

But the settlement can empower buyers to negotiate how much they pay their agent, which could also lead to an overall lower cost of buying a home.

While it's unclear what changes the settlement will bring to home prices, experts agree that it will likely change who gets to continue working in the real estate industry.

The settlement will probably encourage buyers to become more invested in who they choose as their agent, as they will be paying them more directly, making it more competitive for buying agents to find clients.

Consumer advocates have argued that there is a glut of real estate agents working in the field, given the licensing process to become an agent is fairly simple. While there is demand for real estate agents with experience, some working in the field don't always work in good faith.

""It's very difficult to police this marketplace because the regulators have limited resources, and they're not fully committed to this. It's very difficult to see ethical and even legal violations,"" Brobeck said. ""A lot of this is just oral agreements between listing brokers, listing agents and buyer agents.""

The settlement could mean a ""more experienced pool of real estate agents and, ultimately, better service for more competitive prices"" for buyers, said Sonia Gilbukh, assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College.

""The high fixed fees that don't depend on experience is what kept a lot of people in the market. Even working with just one deal makes it worthwhile for people to stay,"" Gilbukh said.

The settlement comes out of a series class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued it was unfair they had to cover the commissions of buyer brokers.

The NAR agreed to pay $418m in damages and to change its commission rules to settle the suits.

In October, a federal jury had found the NAR guilty in on one of the suits, finding the organization and other residential brokerages liable for $1.78bn in damages for conspiring to artificially inflate commissions.

NAR has denied the price-fixing allegations. In a statement, NAR's interim CEO, Nykia Wright, said that the organization's goal is ""to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible"".

""This settlement achieves both of those goals,"" Wright said. While there could be no perfect outcome, this agreement is the best outcome we could achieve in the circumstances. It provides a path forward for our industry, which makes up nearly one-fifth of the American economy, and NAR.""

That the settlement is expected to have such a widespread impact on real estate transactions shows just how much power NAR has over the industry, experts point out.

""It is a very big deal to see them take a loss,"" Bresbis said. ""They haven't really had to in the entirety of their existence, maybe since the New Deal.""

The group, which was founded in 1908, has $1bn in assets and has been a powerful lobbying arm for the real estate industry.

But the real estate industry has been going through intense changes over the last decade. Record-high home prices have left many homebuyers disgruntled by the market - a majority of renters in a recent Harris poll indicated that the American dream of buying a home is dead - and new technology has empowered buyers with more information about the market. Instead of relying solely on a broker, homebuyers can also turn to websites like Zillow or Redfin - both alternatives to the NAR's MLS - to try to find their home.

NAR's settlement shows how the organization, while still powerful in the real estate industry, is starting to wobble under these pressures.

""For so many decades, NAR was essentially the central organization in determining the shape of housing policy,"" Besbris said. ""To see them on the backfoot is a big shift in how much power they have.""",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Lauren Aratani,0.1764705882352942,448970908,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99c813dc449a727c93dce83ed8c9e14072df3dca/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=78d454265c117d7e61e23f26fbc8e7a3,

Whereas the S&P 500 is the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, and the Dow Jones is considered a barometer for blue chip stocks, the Nasdaq is a growth-focused index weighted heavily toward the technology sector.

In November 2021, the Nasdaq dropped into a bear market amid recession fears brought on by runaway inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. The index declined 36% before reaching its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But the recession many economists expected has yet to materialize. Instead, economic growth accelerated last year, and many stocks rebounded sharply, helped along by cooling inflation and excitement about artificial intelligence.

The Nasdaq finally reached a new record high on Feb. 29, 2024. Crossing that threshold made the new bull market official, a development that has historically portended substantial gains for investors. Specifically, the Nasdaq has only been through eight other bull markets since 1990, and the index has generally moved much higher during those periods.

Read on to learn more.

History says the Nasdaq Composite could soar 157% by April 2026

Some investors use the term bull market loosely, often to describe a substantial gain following a recent low. But other investors subscribe to a more precise definition, which stipulates that two things must happen for a bull market to occur:

What makes that definition tricky is the timing. A bull market technically begins when an index reaches its bear market low, but it does not become official until it reaches a record high. For instance, the current Nasdaq Composite bull market started when the index reached its bear market low on Dec. 28, 2022. But it was not official until 14 months later, when the index reached a new high on Feb. 29, 2024.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq has experienced eight complete bull markets since 1990. The table below provides details on each of those events.

Data source: YCharts. Note: Percentages and averages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

As shown above, the Nasdaq returned an average 215% during the eight bull markets that have taken place since 1990, and it realized those returns over an average of 1,223 days (about 40 months). Put differently, the Nasdaq returned about 41% annually during past bull markets. We can use that information to make a somewhat educated guess about the future.

Specifically, the Nasdaq has advanced 58% since the current bull market began about 15 months ago. That leaves implied upside of 157% over the next 25 months. In other words, the Nasdaq should return 57% annually through April 2026 if its performance aligns with the historical average. I call that a somewhat educated guess because past bull markets have varied greatly in terms of returns and duration, which means there is a great deal of uncertainty baked into my estimate.

Ultimately, the economic climate plays a major role in how the index performs over any period, and past performance never guarantees future results. For instance, the current bull market follows a pandemic that pushed U.S. inflation to its highest level since 1981. That prompted the Federal Reserve to embark on its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in decades. Those events could impact the economy for years to come, so the current bull market may not follow the historical pattern.

In fact, I would be surprised if the Nasdaq returned anything close to 157% over the next 25 months. I say that because the S&P 500, the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, currently trades at 25.6 times earnings. That is a significant premium to the 10-year average of 21.2 times earnings, indicating that many stocks have historically expensive valuations.

Short-term results are variable, but history says long-term investors will be well rewarded

Predicting the future performance of the stock market is impossible, but some forecasting methods are better than others. In most cases, rather than focusing on specific events like bull markets, it makes more sense to consider performance across all market environments. That strategy should yield more reliable results simply because it accounts for more data points.

With that in mind, the Nasdaq Composite has increased 3,500% since 1990, compounding at an annual rate of 11%. That period covers a broad enough range of economic climates that similar returns are likely in the future. That does not mean the index will return 11% every year, but rather that its average return will land somewhere around 11% per year over the next three or four decades.

Investors can capitalize on that data by purchasing an index fund that tracks the Nasdaq Composite. Alternatively, given the technology-heavy nature of the index, investors could also benefit from adding some technology stocks to their portfolios. That is especially true of companies in fast-growing markets like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and robotic process automation.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

The filter, a highly sensitive plasmonic-based detector, was designed specifically to detect harmful piperidine molecular residue in water.

Piperidine and its derivatives have various applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Piperidine's versatility makes it used as a building block in organic synthesis to create more complex molecules and is commonly used to treat a wide range of medical conditions. It is also used in various chemicals, including dyes, pesticides, flavours, and fragrances, as well as treating metal to protect it from corrosion.

However, piperidine can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in high concentrations. It can also react with other chemicals to produce hazardous by-products. Improper disposal of piperidine can contaminate soil, water or air. Detecting even trace amounts of piperidine is imperative for safeguarding drinking water and food safety.

The nanofilter features triangular cavities etched in a silver thin film, shielded by a 5-nanometer layer of silicon dioxide, offering unparalleled sensitivity to piperidine by detecting low concentrations in water.

The development of this dime-sized device was spearheaded by Mohamed Hamode, a Ph.D. student at Bar-Ilan's Department of Chemistry, in collaboration with Dr. Elad Segal. Employing a focused ion microscope, Hamode meticulously drilled nanometer-sized holes onto a metal surface, utilising a custom-built computer programme to shape the holes.

The minute apertures, smaller than the wavelength of visible light, intensify the electrical field on the surface, resulting in concentrated light in extremely confined areas. This amplification allows for the detection of low concentrations of molecules that were previously undetectable with optical probes.

The plasmonic substrate, characterized by its confined and enhanced electromagnetic field, presents an efficient alternative to existing substrates utilized in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). This breakthrough opens avenues for the utilization of cost-effective and portable Raman devices, facilitating quicker and more affordable analysis.

""By harnessing nano-patterned metallic surfaces, we have demonstrated the detection of low concentrations of piperidine in water using affordable optics, offering a promising solution for environmental analytical setups,"" said lead researcher Prof. Adi Salomon.(ANI/TPS)",theprint.in,news,ThePrint,,0.1137254901960785,448970688,1,,eng-9421451

Up here at the backyard barnyard, hints of the change of season are suddenly evident. The periwinkle vinca is in bloom. Daffodils are pushing up through thick layers of leaves in the perennial borders, and garlic I thought was lost to the spade is standing tall and green in the garden. My two elderly hens are giving eggs every now and then, and by some miracle, the bees survived the winter and on warm days are flying out and returning to the hive with pale pollen packed tight to their hind legs.

It's a tiny spread, but I do think about managing it in ways that are best for the environment and also have good outcomes, like honey and vegetables, for people. My place is a far cry from the Park County ranch that stars in Tracy Ross' cover story this week, but I like to think that I share some values with Dave and Jean Gottenborg, who say they're managing their place with the idea in mind that they are only temporary caretakers of something with extraordinary environmental value.

If you're familiar with the poet Wendell Berry, chances are you've read ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" about how, when despair for the world grows in him, he ""wakes at the least sound / in fear of what (his) life and (his) children's lives may be"" and goes outside to lie in ""the peace of wild things.""

It's a beautiful poem, evoking the power of the natural world to sustain us. But the Berry poem that feels more apropos of my story this week is ""Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front.""

""Manifesto"" calls the reader to do things that defy social norms, comfort, even reason. It warns the reader against the lure of ""the quick profit, the annual raise, vacation with pay."" But Berry offers alternatives, too: ""Love the Lord. Love the world. Work for nothing,"" and more importantly, ask questions and ""invest in the millennium.""

Dave Gottenborg, the subject of my story this week, loves Berry's work, I think because it helps guide him in his own work. Gottenborg made good money in a small oil and gas company and then used some of it to buy a ranch with his wife, Jean, in Park County. It's a beautiful spread, 3,000 acres, and the best part is how the Gottenborgs ranch it. They take a conservation-first approach that puts all creatures -- sentient and not -- on equal footing with humans.

Dave's inspiration to do that was the great conservationist Aldo Leopold, author of ""A Sand County Almanac."" I might be overwhelming you with literary references here, but they're important. With Berry and Leopold looking over his shoulder, Gottenborg has been refining his conservation ethic on Eagle Rock Ranch for just over a decade. And the Colorado Cattlemen's Association thought highly enough of his and Jean's work that they awarded them its commercial producer of the year award.

They're also thinking of ways they and other ranchers can enhance and elevate conservation on their own ranches to add to their profit margins. That might just help them as we move into a future in which $20 billion in conservation agriculture funding in the Farm Bill is being hotly debated in Congress. I hope you'll read the story to see how Dave and Jean, inspired by Aldo and Wendell, are pushing themselves all the time to show the world the benefits of conservation ranching.

In case you missed it, we've curated our own visual feed of reporting to catch you up. Here are a few of our favorite recent images of everyday places, people and moments from every corner of Colorado.

I remember the first time I biked 50 miles for a blueberry muffin. The muffin itself was very mediocre, but the way it served as a beacon of hope, rest and sugar at the route's apex was something just short of spectacular. This is the logic of the coffee ride. It's a way to break up a route into digestible chunks, ensure a mid-ride caffeine spike, and create a space to gather with other cyclists -- even if that means deliriously sipping an espresso next to someone you just met.

Some places deliberately position themselves at the intersection of coffee and cycling. The Rapha Clubhouse in Boulder, for instance, has woven these two cultures together so thoroughly that it's hard to tell whether it's a bike-themed coffee shop or a coffee-themed bike shop. Last year, Bicycle Colorado led a series of coffee commutes, group bike rides that left from various coffee shops around Denver.

Other spots have a lucky geography, like The Mountain Fountain in Hygiene. If you've lived in Colorado long enough, you may remember The Mountain Fountain as Clark's Food Store, Mary's Market or the Purple Door Market, but in almost every iteration, the low brick building has been a popular spring and summer spot for cyclists to gather.

Its location, at a three-way intersection surrounded by farms, makes a perfect 30-mile round trip from Valmont Bike Park in Boulder. Its outdoor seating -- including a bench donated by Mountain Fountain regulars, the SOBs (seniors on bikes) -- and ample bike racks create a great atmosphere for gathering. The wide deli counter, fresh pies and full-service cafe create just the right incentive to keep pedaling. Mountain Fountain owner Carrie Olson mentioned that they also keep products from Boulder-based Skratch Labs and pickle brine shots on deck for cyclists, and that water fill-ups are always free.

So squeeze into those spandex shorts and aim for the espresso machine, spring is here and summer's not far behind.

SunLit: Tell us about creating this book. What influences and/or experiences informed the project before you sat down to write?

Wright: My heritage always plays a role in my writing. I am multiracial but was raised Native American. Nature is just something that I have been taught to pay attention to. Animals, trees, the water speak to us and we have to slow down and pay attention to hear. Nature was speaking a lot to me, reminding me that the answers are always there, I just had to have the courage to listen.

🌞 It's tax season -- both personal and property -- which invariably has people asking why Colorado property taxes feel so high when our taxes are comparatively low. Brian Eason has some answers. And in a completely related story, he stayed up way too late many nights last week waiting for the Joint Budget Committee to finish work on the (tax-funded) state budget.

🌞Things were a little feisty at the statehouse last week, with lawmakers ordering the feds to ""do your job"" and fund long-overdue repairs to an irrigation system on the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation and in La Plata County, and handfuls of competing ballot measures getting turned in to turn up the heat on debate over bills dealing with air quality and climate change. A bill that would make it illegal to buy and sell a broad swath of semi-automatic weapons made it out of committee. And lawmakers are considering a bill that would, for the first time, regulate the treatment plans and clinical practices of eating disorder treatment facilities.

🌞 A lot of people thought that by now, Coloradans would be paying less for their medications under a drug importation plan created in 2019. But U.S. drug manufacturers have tough agreements with their Canadian distributors that have mucked up the program. John Ingold reports on the wrangling going on to maybe someday get the plan launched.

🌞 All that snow that shut down Front Range schools and governments for two days also did a number on snowpack levels high in the mountains -- in a good way. Shannon Mullane reports snow levels across the state are now above average and that bodes well for the water year.

🌞 Denver's plan to scale back services to the thousands of people who arrived by bus from the border with Mexico was upset by foul weather in the forecast. Advocates for Central and South American migrants are especially worried about families with children who are living in tents, Jennifer Brown learned.

🌞 Crocheting is the latest craze among teens and tweens at Challenge School in Aurora. Kids who are hooked on the craft told Erica Breunlin the after-school club has helped them unfurl their creativity.

Thanks for spending a bit of your morning with us. We appreciate the time, especially when we are quite aware that there are cool season seeds begging to be planted. If you'd like to share the Sunday in-box camaraderie with someone, please send them to coloradosun.com/join. The more, the merrier!

Despite successfully meeting seven out of the nine established criteria for the upgrade, the two other requirements remain considerable roadblocks.

To tackle the pre-trade margin requirement challenge, Linh revealed ongoing discussions with international rating agencies are being conducted to seek viable solutions. Additionally, the SSC has proposed regulatory amendments and supplements to the Ministry of Finance (MoF). These revisions, if implemented, would eliminate the need for a 100% cash margin requirement for foreign institutional investors, provided they can demonstrate a secure payment process.

Regarding the foreign ownership ratios, the SSC is collaborating with the MoF and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to conduct a comprehensive review across various industries.

The SSC has proposed that the MPI work alongside other relevant ministries and agencies to expand foreign ownership limits in non-essential sectors. This critical information, translated into English, is expected to be publicly available soon.

The SSC is also making efforts to improve information disclosure regulations, specifically for public and large-scale listed companies. The proposed amendments, once approved by the MoF, would mandate English disclosure for both regular and irregular information updates.

The implementation timeline for these changes would see English disclosures become mandatory for regular information and large-scale company listings starting January 1, 2025. Irregular information disclosures would follow suit by January 1, 2026, with the requirement encompassing all public companies by January 1, 2028.

Seoul: The fourth unit of the South Korea-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, South Korea's state-run utility company said on Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

This coincides with promises by authorities dominating the region to adopt procedures for changes and reforms in order to ease off the sufferings of residents who have been grappling with high taxes and economical and commercial predominance by influential individuals and HTS commanders.

Since early Ramadan, the prices of all basic products and food stuffs have noticeably increased, many sources have reported that most of the region's inhabitants are unable to buy many products and foodstuffs, such as meat, chicken, deserts and many types of vegetables, especially since the current skyrocketing prices coincides with lack of job opportunities and low salaries and wages.

With the prohibitively high prices since early Ramadan, the most of poor families in Idlib depend on the Iftar meals provided daily by some associations, organisations and voluntary initiatives, so that those families can secure other essentials, mainly bread.

Residents have accused some merchants affiliated with Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham of stockpiling vegetables, fruit and meat and intentionally increasing their prices in every Ramadan. However, the this year's prices have increased to an unprecedented level. This coincided with the ongoing freefall of the Turkish currency, which is adopted in HTS-held areas, where the Turkish lira against the US dollar recorded 33 TL.

SOHR activists have toured markets in Idlib city and countryside and monitored the prices of some vegetables and meat, which can be listed as follows:

It is worth noting that the Turkish lira against the US dollar recorded 33 TL, while the daily wages of workers ranges between 30 and 100 TL every worker, based on the kind of work and number of working hours.

Moreover, the domination over crossings, commercial movement and markets and the imposition of taxes and levies on merchants and civilians have deepened the sufferings of civilians in HTS-held areas in north-west Syria.

The findings on the filter, developed by researchers at Bar-Ilan University, were presented in the peer-reviewed journal, Environmental Science: Nano.

The filter, a highly sensitive plasmonic-based detector, was designed specifically to detect harmful piperidine molecular residue in water.

Piperidine and its derivatives have various applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Piperidine's versatility makes it used as a building block in organic synthesis to create more complex molecules and is commonly used to treat a wide range of medical conditions. It is also used in various chemicals, including dyes, pesticides, flavours, and fragrances, as well as treating metal to protect it from corrosion.

However, piperidine can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in high concentrations. It can also react with other chemicals to produce hazardous by-products. Improper disposal of piperidine can contaminate soil, water or air. Detecting even trace amounts of piperidine is imperative for safeguarding drinking water and food safety.

The nanofilter features triangular cavities etched in a silver thin film, shielded by a 5-nanometer layer of silicon dioxide, offering unparalleled sensitivity to piperidine by detecting low concentrations in water.

The development of this dime-sized device was spearheaded by Mohamed Hamode, a Ph.D. student at Bar-Ilan's Department of Chemistry, in collaboration with Dr. Elad Segal. Employing a focused ion microscope, Hamode meticulously drilled nanometer-sized holes onto a metal surface, utilising a custom-built computer programme to shape the holes.

The minute apertures, smaller than the wavelength of visible light, intensify the electrical field on the surface, resulting in concentrated light in extremely confined areas. This amplification allows for the detection of low concentrations of molecules that were previously undetectable with optical probes.

The plasmonic substrate, characterized by its confined and enhanced electromagnetic field, presents an efficient alternative to existing substrates utilized in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). This breakthrough opens avenues for the utilization of cost-effective and portable Raman devices, facilitating quicker and more affordable analysis.

""By harnessing nano-patterned metallic surfaces, we have demonstrated the detection of low concentrations of piperidine in water using affordable optics, offering a promising solution for environmental analytical setups,"" said lead researcher Prof. Adi Salomon.(ANI/TPS)",aninews.in,news,Asian News International (ANI),,0.05882352941176472,448970064,1,https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20240324094601.jpg,eng-9421451

Here's What History Says About Stock Market Returns When Democrats Win.,"It's that time again -- and I'm not talking about earnings season.

In a little over seven months, Americans across the country will head to the polls or mail in their ballots to determine who'll lead the country over the coming four years. Although there are plenty of aspects of politics that have no bearing on Wall Street, fiscal policy changes that originate in Washington, D.C., and are signed into law by the president of the United States, can ultimately impact corporate earnings and the health of the U.S. economy.

With nearly 2,500 delegates in the ongoing primaries, incumbent Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee for president from the Democratic Party. Since Biden took office as the 46th president on Jan. 20, 2021, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), have respectively gained 28%, 36%, and 22%. All three major stock indexes have also achieved fresh all-time highs since the year began.

But could a second term of Joe Biden at the helm cause stocks to plunge? Let's take a closer look at some of the downside catalysts that could lie ahead and let history be the ultimate judge.

President Biden delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz.

Are stocks going to crash if Joe Biden wins in November?

Regardless of who's president, Wall Street is always contending with headwinds. Should Joe Biden get the nod from voters in November, a combination of policy proposals (if signed into law) and macroeconomic factors have the potential to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite off of their respective pedestals.

One of the more concerning proposals, from an investment perspective, is Biden's recent call to raise the tax on stock buybacks from the current 1% to 4%. This may not sound like much, but S&P 500 companies are estimated to have repurchased in the neighborhood of $800 billion worth of their common stock in 2023.

For businesses with steady or growing net income, share repurchase programs that lower their outstanding share count can have a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). In other words, companies enacting buybacks can appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors. Quadrupling the buyback tax could make share repurchase programs less attractive, thereby slowing EPS growth.

Additionally, President Biden has called for an increase to the corporate alternative minimum tax rate to 21% from the current rate of 15% for businesses with at least $1 billion in profits, and has proposed increasing the peak U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21%. On paper, taxing corporate profits at a higher rate would be expected to reduce spending on innovation, hiring, and acquisitions.

However, it's not just policy proposals from President Biden that could give Wall Street the jitters. A couple of money-based metrics and recession-predicting tools suggest a second term for Biden could involve meaningful downside for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.

For example, U.S. M2 money supply is declining by more than 2% from its all-time high for only the fifth time when back-tested more than 150 years, and the first time since the Great Depression, as highlighted in the post above by Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli. M2 money supply accounts for everything in M1 (cash and coins in circulation, along with demand deposits in a checking account) and adds in savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000.

The previous four times M2 money supply notably declined occurred in 1878, 1893, 1921, and 1931-1933. All four of these instances are associated with deflationary depressions and high periods of unemployment. While fiscal and monetary tools make it highly unlikely that we'd see a depression materialize today, a sizable decline in M2 money supply does suggest consumers and businesses will make fewer discretionary purchases.

Other predictive tools, such as the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability measure, suggest economic weakness is in the cards.

On paper, a stock market plunge can't be ruled out, regardless of who's in the Oval Office come Jan. 20, 2025. But there's another side to history that should have patient investors excited about the future.

Here's what history says happens to stocks when Democrats win the presidency

Historically speaking, the stock market has averaged a positive annualized return with both Democrats and Republicans as president. But since 1945, Democrats in the Oval Office have outperformed Republicans.

According to an analysis from independent financial intelligence company CFRA Research in 2020 (i.e., prior to Biden taking office), Democrat presidents have overseen an 11.2% annualized return in the S&P 500, compared to 6.9% for their Republican counterparts. For instance, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama oversaw respective annualized gains of 15.2% and 13.8% during their eight-year terms.

While there have been a few Republican presidents that have been in office during a rough period for Wall Street -- e.g., the S&P 500 shed 5.6% on an annualized basis while George W. Bush was in office -- Republican Calvin Coolidge oversaw the best stock market performance of any president. In the roughly 5-1/2 years Coolidge was president during the Roaring Twenties, the market delivered a blistering annualized return of 26.1%!

The point being that, over long periods, it doesn't matter which party finds itself in the Oval Office. Although budget proposals from presidential candidates can occasionally stir the pot and upset Wall Street, these events tend to be very short-lived.

Widening the lens beyond four- and eight-year presidential terms yields even more encouraging results for patient investors.

Last June, analysts at market insights firm Bespoke Investment Group published a data set that examined the length of bear and bull markets in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What they found was a milewide disparity between optimism and pessimism on Wall Street.

Over the past 94 years, the 27 bear markets the S&P 500 has worked its way through cleared in an average of 286 calendar days, or about 9.5 months. By comparison, the typical bull market has lasted 1,011 calendar days, or 3.5 times as long.

A separate study conducted by Crestmont Research looked back even further. Since the components of the S&P could be found in other major stock indexes prior to the creation of the S&P in 1923, Crestmont was able to back-test its return data to 1900.

What the researchers at Crestmont did was analyze the rolling 20-year total returns (I.e., including dividends paid) of the S&P 500 since 1900. This yielded 105 unique periods of rolling 20-year total returns (1919-2023).

Here's the kicker: All 105 rolling 20-year periods produced a positive total return. Regardless of which party controls the White House, hypothetically holding an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years has been a foolproof investment strategy for more than a century.

To add, these weren't paltry gains, either. Whereas you can count on one hand how many rolling 20-year timelines produced annualized total returns of between 3.1% and 5%, more than 50 of these 105 rolling 20-year time frames generated annualized total returns of between 9% and 17.1%.

If Joe Biden wins a second term as president, history suggests long-term investors are going to be well-positioned to grow their wealth on Wall Street.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, more than 6,000 outdated Bitcoin mining devices in the United States will be refreshed and resold to miners across the world. Amidst Bitcoin's fluctuations and anticipations of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the new development is intended to help miners yield profit during the halving event.

The refurbishment of the machines would reportedly take place in a warehouse in Colorado Springs. Later, these devices would be resold to miners across various nations, especially in countries with less electricity costs, like Africa and South America.

Elizabeth Dasburg from Georgia, Esther van der Werf of California and Toby Stover of New York filed a lawsuit in early March, alleging the park service's cashless policy is violating the federal law.

The trio said they were not able to use cash when visiting monuments, national parks and other locations in the U.S. Since U.S. currency is ""legal tender for all public charges,"" NPS's policy of refusing it at some locations is infringing on federal law, the lawsuit filed on March 6 alleges.

NPS's ""violation"" cannot be ""overlooked,"" the suit argues, although the plaintiffs are not asking the court ""to prohibit NPS from accepting credit cards, debit cards, or digital payment methods (such as ApplePay) should visitors to NPS sites prefer to use them.""

The plaintiffs' cash payments were rejected in Georgia, Arizona and New York.

Van der Werf was allegedly barred entry at three different locations in Arizona run by the federal agency. Stover was not able to tour New York's Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Site after attempting to use $10 in cash for the tour.

NPS does not accept cash payments at 29 locations, according to the lawsuit.

The cashless policy has been in effect since 2019 for park passes in Arizona. Similar adjustments were set to come this year to locations in Montana, Colorado and California. NPS has argued the shift is lessening wait times and making it easier to count the amount charged for each visitor.",bradenton.com,news,Bradenton Herald,Filip Timotija,-0.2392156862745098,448969655,1,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/gn5qx4/picture281689288/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/eac0d28f-dab5-4b01-9879-4696628c3b0b,

The viral infection was passed from a patient to a doctor, but the doctor's symptoms have improved, the NIID said earlier this week.

The doctor, a man in his 20s, attended to a patient in his 90s who had been diagnosed with SFTS after visiting the emergency room last April due to deteriorating health, the institute said.

The doctor performed various procedures on the patient, who later died, including removing his catheter post-mortem, during which the doctor reportedly wore a face mask and gloves but no goggles.

Approximately nine days after the patient's death, the doctor developed symptoms of fever and headache and was diagnosed with SFTS upon medical examination, it added.

The genes of the viruses in the two men were found to be identical, confirming human-to-human transmission, marking the first such instance in Japan, according to the NIID.",news.cgtn.com,news,news.cgtn.com,,-0.192156862745098,448969536,1,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-03-24/Japan-confirms-1st-human-to-human-spread-of-tick-borne-viral-disease-1setcqmTo2Y/img/ffa9db4c3c3d4ab388675e8b1ba8ac52/ffa9db4c3c3d4ab388675e8b1ba8ac52-750.jpeg?t=20240324170052059,

The species were included in the CMS Appendix II, which covers migratory species with unfavourable conservation status, requiring international cooperation for their conservation and management. This inclusion in Appendix II opens the door for better conservation of these migratory felids known for their elusive behaviour.

The Central Asian lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus), a subspecies of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is found in Central Asia, including India's trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and is sparsely distributed. Its sightings have been rare. The medium-sized carnivorous cat species is also known as Tibetan lynx, Turkestan lynx or Himalayan lynx because of its distribution in these regions.

The Pallas' cat (Otocolobus manul) is a small cold-adapted species named after Russian zoologist Peter Simon Pallas who first described it in 1776. In India, the Pallas' cat has been recorded in Ladakh, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh.

Neeraj Mahar, project scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India, said, ""Inclusion of both lesser cats in the CMS Appendix II will certainly provide weightage globally and in India, especially in countries where manuls are being kept in captivity and poached for pelts. In India, both cats are rarely sighted species and there is very little information available on their distribution and status. Being a signatory country at the CMS, India needs to conserve both cats in its Himalayan and trans-Himalayan region and across its borders.""

Experts, for a long time, have been calling for targeted conservation efforts for these species as the population of both cats in India appears to be declining.

""These two species have been facing myriad threats to their existence in several parts of their ranges. We have small populations of the two species in Ladakh with hotspots such as the Hanley Valley. Both of them have been facing challenges that are both natural and manmade, especially the free-ranging dogs,"" Tsewang Namgyal, a director and senior scientist at the Snow Leopard Conservancy India Trust (SLC-IT), a Ladakh-based non-profit, told Mongabay-India.

Namgail said that with the inclusion in Appendix II, countries would be encouraged to collaborate across borders, share information, coordinate conservation efforts and implement measures to ensure the survival of these species throughout their range.

The proposal to include the Central Asian lynx in the convention's Appendix II noted that the Central Asian sub-species of the Eurasian lynx, among its cousins, is the least known subspecies and information on its distribution, abundance and trend is unavailable.

""Its conservation status has hence never been assessed according to the IUCN Red List (The International Union for Conservation of Nature) procedures. Its range however overlaps largely with the snow leopard and we hope to profit from the network established for snow leopard conservation to compile data on the lynx, too,"" the proposal read.

In India, the medium-sized wildcat is found in Ladakh and feeds on small mammals and rodents such as Royal's pika, Tibetan woolly hare, female or juvenile ungulates (because of their smaller size) and domestic sheep and goat. Central Asian lynx occurs in Central Asia from Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.

The convention laid down a step-by-step plan, according to which a baseline survey and a robust assessment of the conservation status need to be executed. The proposal suggested contacting a range of states to submit a proposal to include the Central Asian lynx in the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI). Preparing the ground for the range-wide conservation through building networks and developing local capacities is needed to achieve these goals.

Mahar said that if this resolution on the Central Asian lynx can help get more international funds and collaborations to carry out research in India, it will help in building baseline data on the wildcat.

He suggested studying the lynx while estimating snow leopard populations in Indian Himalayan states. ""During the snow leopard estimation exercise, the methods can be modified or developed to study the lynx as well, which will provide baseline data on the lynx and will further assimilate other aspects of the species,"" he explained.

Yash Veer Bhatnagar, country representative at the IUCN, said, ""In India, lynx have naturally been rare. We are in the extreme of the lynx occurrence. For any research to study or research totally on lynx can become a challenge as there are very few sightings. Some of these studies can come from occupancy-based work where the researcher goes and tries to get the information about the occurrence from herders and forest staff.""

The proposal for Pallas' cat highlighted that the ""Pallas' cat has received far less attention than several larger species and their conservation has been relatively neglected."" The cat has an extensive but fragmented range from the South Caucasus through southwest Asia, Central Asia, Mongolia, the Russian Federation, and western China.

""The proposed listing on Appendix II of the Convention and development of the Concerted Action, will significantly increase the profile of the species among policymakers, formally require a range of state governments to consider Pallas' cat conservation, provide a robust international conservation framework for action, and facilitate the raising of funds: taken together, these measures will mark a step-change in the conservation of Pallas' at,"" the proposal read.

The activities under the proposal included the addition of the Pallas' Cat to CAMI, the development of an associated Programme of Work aligned with the Pallas'Cat Strategy and Action Plan 2018-2028, and the effective implementation of the Concerted Action and Programme of Work to enhance the conservation status of the species.

The proposed objectives also called for understanding and reducing human-caused mortality, because of free-ranging dogs or the poisoning, of Pallas' cat.

The Concerted Action proposal has been developed by Pallas' Cat International Conservation Alliance (PICA), IUCN Cat Specialist Group and Manul Working Group (MWG), which collectively include a comprehensive network of conservationists, researchers, and others involved in the conservation of this charismatic carnivore.

""Now, there are chances of better coordination and cooperation among ranging countries as both species were discussed thoroughly during CMS COP14. Both species might get mileage in Himalayan countries like Bhutan, India and Nepal. But first and foremost, there is a need to start studying both cats since basic information lags in India; a country like Nepal has an upper hand in manul research. We (MWG) have already highlighted needs and concerns during Pallas' Cat Global Action Planning Group Meeting, 2019 where we developed a global action plan for manul,"" Mahar said. He is a part of Manul Working Group and has also co-authored an article on Pallas' Cat status review and conservation strategy.

""Scientists and conservationists have already started working in collaboration through PICA and MWG. Now with CMS COP14, there are more options of (legal) collaboration among the signatory countries with the involvement of respective governments and ministries,"" he added.

Although the developments during the CMS COP14 are considered steps in the right direction towards conserving the two wildcats found in India, some wildlife experts feel that this move is not enough to tackle the challenges faced by these species.

SLC-IT's Namgail said that since the species that were added to Appendix II at COP13 the year before, haven't received much international attention or an increase in funding for their conservation, expectations from the declarations at COP14 are low. ""Some of the species that are already on Appendix I and II of the CMS, such as the snow leopard, the Himalayan brown bear and the Ladakh urial, which were added to Appendix II at COP13 haven't received much international attention. The snow leopard has also been declared as the state animal of the union territory Ladakh but, so far, we haven't seen any increase in funding to implement ecological studies and conservation programmes,"" he added, calling for more support and funding within India for the two cats.

""Many of these species listed on Appendix II of CMS, are also listed on Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972), but not much attention is paid to ensure their long-term survival. So, if their listing in national legislations does not help much in mobilising funds and conservation efforts, one cannot expect much from these international treaties,"" he added.

Mahar added that while he does not see a paradigm shift in the extent of protection, the move is still beneficial for the conservation of the cats. ""IUCN Cat Specialist Group and Manul Working Group (MWG) have been working on this (Pallas' Cat) proposal for a long time. We have already provided an apex protection guard under the legal framework of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. However, more collaborations and an influx of international funds will help in the ecological studies and conservation of both cats in India.""",nenow.in,news,NORTHEAST NOW,,0.1294117647058823,448968973,1,https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/wildcats.png,

This includes sanitary facilities, upgraded drainage, and a dedicated parking lot for a more positive experience for both vendors and customers.

This development stems from President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali's visit back in 2022, when he recognised the challenges faced by those using the market. An influx of vendors had created congestion and impacted established vendors. In response to these concerns, the President initiated a plan to construct the new tarmac and upgrade the access road.

In December 2022, a $149 million contract was signed for the 8000sq. meter tarmac.

With the tarmac complete, vendors will be relocated soon. This will allow for the planned upgrades to the access road to begin, thereby improving overall traffic flow and market accessibility.

President Ali on Saturday morning visited the Leonora Market once again, where he highlighted his commitment to replicating such improvements across the country.

""This will be the design of all the markets we are looking at nationally. Concrete drains, washrooms, accessibility, parking, washroom facilities. We are going to do a highway coming in, and all the vendors will come here, so we won't have any issues,"" the President said.

Meanwhile, Minister within the Ministry of Public Works Mr. Deodat Indar will return to the market in the new week to engage vendors, and begin the relocation process.

Minister Indar said that he will be working alongside the local government ministry for this phase.

""We are now doing further work; that initial market tarmac is now completed, so we have to start moving people in, because we have to do the road as well. I think on Tuesday we will meet with the vendors; we can have a transitional period, where they come in, and we will have to demarcate here as well,"" he told the Department of Public Information (DPI).

A similar process will also soon begin at the Hydronie Market on the East Bank of Essequibo. The President also conducted an assessment of the prices for vegetables and other commodities, and said they were stable.

Crops such as plantains, eddoes, and potatoes are being sold at $100 per pound, while vegetables such as celery and bora are priced at $200 per parcel.

The global discourse surrounding environmental sustainability has intensified recently, prompting significant shifts in various industries worldwide. Real estate is crucial in pursuing sustainability due to its substantial environmental footprint and long-term implications for livelihoods and ecosystems. Building operations account for 30% of global final energy consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions, with 8% being direct emissions in buildings and 18% indirect emissions from the production of electricity and heat used in buildings.

Green buildings are designed and constructed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly throughout their lifecycle. On the other hand, energy efficiency involves using less energy to provide the same level of comfort, functionality, and productivity in buildings. Therefore, the nexus between green buildings and energy efficiency is significant and fundamental to socio-economic development and environmental conservation.

Green building practices hold immense potential for creating a new economy, fostering economic growth, and mitigating environmental degradation. These practices include energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, use of sustainable materials, and implementation of renewable energy sources.

Today's article focuses on energy efficiency, which significantly impacts the national economy and is a cornerstone of sustainable development. It offers many economic benefits that extend far beyond mere cost savings. It further explores the intricate interplay between energy efficiency and the national economy, delineating how it catalyses job creation, fosters innovation, enhances competitiveness, and fortifies environmental stewardship.

Energy efficiency initiatives constitute a linchpin in the quest for economic resilience. By optimising energy consumption patterns, businesses, households, and governmental entities can unlock substantial cost savings. Reduced energy expenditures translate into surplus capital that can be reinvested across diverse sectors, amplifying economic dynamism. Moreover, diminished operational costs bolster profit margins, rendering businesses more competitive in domestic and international markets.

The proliferation of energy efficiency measures spawns many employment opportunities across various industries. Initiatives such as retrofitting buildings, upgrading infrastructure, and deploying renewable energy technologies necessitate a skilled labour force, fostering job creation in construction, manufacturing, engineering, and other ancillary sectors. This influx of employment mitigates unemployment rates and invigorates local economies, catalysing sustainable growth trajectories.

Energy efficiency constitutes a potent catalyst for economic expansion, propelling demand for energy-efficient products and services. This burgeoning demand stimulates innovation and entrepreneurship, spurring the development of cutting-edge technologies and business models. Consequently, nations can augment their industrial competitiveness while fostering a conducive ecosystem for sustainable growth. Furthermore, the proliferation of energy efficiency initiatives nurtures a culture of resource optimisation, thereby ingraining principles of fiscal prudence within the economic fabric.

By curtailing energy consumption and bolstering domestic production, energy efficiency initiatives diminish reliance on imported energy sources, thereby fortifying energy security. Nations endowed with abundant renewable resources can harness the potential of energy efficiency to reduce their carbon footprint while concurrently mitigating vulnerabilities associated with global energy markets. This transition towards energy autonomy insulates economies against geopolitical uncertainties, ensuring a stable and resilient energy landscape.

Energy efficiency initiatives engender a virtuous cycle of environmental stewardship by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating air pollution, and conserving natural resources. Furthermore, the concomitant improvements in air quality confer substantial health benefits, thereby alleviating the burden on healthcare systems and enhancing overall societal well-being.

Energy-efficient infrastructure stands as a bulwark against the vagaries of climate change and natural disasters, bolstering societal resilience in the face of adversity. Buildings fortified with energy-efficient designs exhibit heightened resilience to extreme weather events, thereby minimising property damage and preserving livelihoods. Similarly, transportation systems equipped with energy-efficient technologies mitigate congestion and enhance mobility, fostering economic continuity amidst disruptions in energy supply.

The embrace of energy efficiency catalyses a renaissance of innovation, propelling advancements in clean energy technologies, innovative grid systems, and sustainable practices. Nations at the vanguard of energy efficiency innovation carve a niche in the global marketplace, positioning themselves as pioneers in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. This technological leadership augments industrial competitiveness and fosters cross-sectoral collaboration, fostering synergies that propel sustainable development agendas.

Energy efficiency emerges as a linchpin of economic prosperity, offering a panacea for myriad socio-economic challenges. By harnessing the multifaceted benefits of energy efficiency, Zimbabwe can foster sustainable growth trajectories, enhance societal well-being, and fortify its resilience in the face of global uncertainties. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, prioritising energy efficiency is imperative, forging a path towards a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable future for future generations.

We can reap these economic benefits by prioritising energy efficiency measures and policies while contributing to a more sustainable and prosperous future. In Zimbabwe, where financial challenges and environmental vulnerabilities intersect, leveraging economic incentives for green building can be pivotal in driving sustainable development.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Mike Juru,0.411764705882353,448968723,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/thestandard/uploads/2024/03/i1YO7VAQnis1Pi67U18XEwRoQYbphKieNc1tHpLa.jpg,eng-9415511

It also increases the need to constantly investigate new and innovative ways to use materials from renewable sources.

In this context, research for the development of materials from renewable sources like lipids, plant-based proteins (zein, soy, pea, gluten), animal-based proteins (gelatin, whey, casein), and polysaccharides (starch, chitosan, sodium alginate, pectin, gums) has grown significantly in recent years.

Some of these environment-friendly materials can be used to develop flexible films, rigid sheets, and foams. They can also be processed into edible systems such as coatings. In addition to being edible, these can also carry antimicrobial and antioxidant functionalities through the addition of bioactive compounds, extending their application to the preparation of bioactive and biodegradable films, foams, and packaging.

The SBCI works by providing a backstop to on-lenders of up to 80% of the lenders' credit risk, and this has encouraged banks and other finance providers to lend funds to business at a lower rate than normal, for longer terms, and up to certain limits without the requirement for collateral or guarantees.

From inception to mid-2023, the SBCI says it has facilitated €3.6bn in business finance. Total funded loans in the period amounted to €1,465m, while guaranteed loans totalled €2,150m. The average loan provided by on-lenders is €65,600, and there have been over 55,000 SMEs who have availed of SBCI-backed loan products.

SBCI analysis shows that 84% of borrowing is used for investment purposes, with the balance deployed for working capital. In sectoral terms, 23% of SBCI-backed loans got to the agriculture and fisheries sector, followed by retail and wholesale (17%), manufacturing (12%), construction (10%), and accommodation and food services (7%).

Ther are two SBCI schemes currently active: the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme. On the way is the Home Energy Upgrade Loan Scheme, which marks a departure for the SBCI as it will involve consumer finance products.

In charge of the SBCI is CEO June Butler, who joined the organisation in September 2021 after a career in Bank of Ireland. From a farming family in Offaly, Butler studied law in Trinity College Dublin and then pivoted into accountancy.

Her initial role at Bank of Ireland was internal audit, followed by a move into finance, operations and then business banking, where she was head of strategy and sectors.

In her bank role, Butler had a close-up view of the business stress resulting from Covid lockdowns in 2020. ""There was uncertainty among businesses, and there was uncertainty in the banks,"" she recalls. ""In February 2020 we had seen Covid impact starting to affect supply chains, so we were already thinking about what supports might be needed.

""In the bank at that time, there was a quick decision to introduce moratoriums for businesses that needed it. We worked very closely with the SBCI to implement the Covid guarantee scheme, and the benefit of that scheme was that it really enabled funding to continue to flow to businesses.

""From a national perspective, having the SBCI meant that Ireland could access the EU supports that were being put in place. That's one of our key roles - to make sure that supports put in place at a European level can be accessed by Irish businesses.""

Butler says she switched from Bank of Ireland to the SBCI because she likes the business arena and she liked the purpose of the SBCI. ""When I saw that opportunity to lead that team, I thought I'll give it a shot,"" she remarks.

An SBCI innovation that Butler can point to is the Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme, which terminated in December 2023. This was established to help SMEs, farmers and fishers cut their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions by investing in energy-saving measures.

Unlike other schemes, the EELS did not receive any funding from government departments, and the SBCI used its own funds to bring the scheme together. The EELS had a funding cap of €150m but in the event only €10m was drawn down.

""Part of what we do is to look into the market, talk to businesses, and understand where there might be gaps or a need there that isn't being fulfilled,"" Butler explains.

""The EELS was designed to lead the market because the evidence showed that SMEs wanted to invest in energy efficiency, and this investment requires longer term funding. So we worked with SMEs and a number of banks to design that scheme and encourage investment a time when energy costs were shooting up.

""Take-up was slower than we hoped, but we had a few good learnings from the pilot. With the new Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme, the loan eligibility criteria are broader. We have maintained the 10-year term because that's really important for borrowers.

""We have a national mandate to highlight the benefits to businesses of these investments, because there really is a bottom line business impact to reducing your carbon emissions.""

The Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme, launched in January 2023, has proved more popular with borrowers. Through last year, some €185m was drawn down by c.2,000 business borrowers.

""Loans up to €250,000 are unsecured, which means there are no personal guarantees, collateral or security required,"" says Butler. ""We are seeing the UKGS being used to support both working capital and investment. There has been a very steady flow across a wide range of sectors, which demonstrates that there really is a need for this kind of government support.""

The Ukraine scheme provides for maximum loan term of six years. The Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme (GSLS), launched in September 2023, provides for a maximum loan term of 10 years.

According to Butler: ""Most banks and non-banks will do loans of up to seven years for a business, but for large strategic investments borrowers were telling us they need longer loan terms. It was based on that feedback and market research that our previous Future Growth Loan Scheme was designed.

""That scheme was very popular, and we did a review to understand what made it attractive to businesses, and did it achieve the objective of encouraging longer term strategic investment. That research pointed a combination of the term, the reduction in the interest rate, and the fact that loans were unsecured up to €500,000 encouraging businesses to take that step and invest.""

With the new GSLS, the SBCI is backstopping up to €500m in credit provision by banks and other lenders. Of the €500m, 30% is earmarked for investment in climate action or environmental sustainable measures to reduce carbon emissions.

""One of the key features in this scheme is that if you qualify under a green measure, there is an additional interest rate discount,"" Butler explains. ""With that incentive of a cheaper interest rate, borrowers might be inclined to consider whether their investment will help reduce carbon emissions. For all SBCI loans, borrowers go through us first, and we've built a 'green checker' into the online application process.""

The SBCI's next initiative is a Home Energy Upgrade Loan Scheme for retrofits of residential properties, which Butler hopes will launch before the summer.

""It is a new departure for us in terms of serving the consumer market rather than the SME and farmer customer base that we have historically supported,"" says Butler. ""However, it is very much in keeping with our strategy to promote sustainability and to fill gaps in the market. The gap in this case is that there isn't much consumer finance available for a 10-year term.""

Around the pandemic period and its immediate aftermath, SBCI guaranteed loans and finance accounted for around one-fifth of the total business lending market. That has come back to under 15%, says Butler.

""Banks are lending, and we're there to fill the gaps. When you consider Brexit, Covid, the Ukraine war, rising interest rates and inflation, there has been a lot of uncertainty for businesses to deal with. There are some firms and farmers who may have deferred or delayed investments, which is understandable. But there many businesses that are expanding and making those more strategic investment decisions.

""When you look at how businesses had to adapt their operating models and explore new markets, they proved their ability to innovate and their resilience. It is not our role to push credit. Our role is to make sure that for businesses who need it and want it, credit is available with the right terms.""

Butler also see the SBCI's role as promoting competition. As well as AIB and Bank of Ireland, CapitalFlow and a number of credit unions are on-lenders for the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme. Finance Ireland is an on-lender for the new Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme along with the two banks, while SBCI funding also facilitates invoice finance products provided by Bibby Financial Services.

""Our business model has evolved into a developer and a promoter of risk sharing products, which gives us lots of flexibility to address specific gaps in the market. The range of lenders that we work with is now over 40, between banks, non-banks, and a wide range of credit unions. We really believe it's important to provide that choice to businesses,"" Butler adds.",businessplus.ie,news,Business Plus,,0.1529411764705881,448968616,1,https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/June-Butler-pic-LI.jpg,

Elections -- local, state and federal -- are the days to let candidates know that a majority of their neighbors are involved and watching how their wallets will be affected.

Politicians look at the numbers and use those numbers. When 30% or 40% of the electorate don't bother to show up at the polls, you are literally giving up your rights.

In last spring's town elections the Cape had a participation range from 5% to 30%. That means 70% to 95% of the electorate decided to let someone else make a decision for them. Locally, that means your money -- money you are giving a small number of voters control over how it is spent.

If you are dissatisfied with the candidates, then write in an alternative candidate of your choice. VOTE! Keep up the numbers of involvement and let the ""experts"" know that they are wrong and can't bank on you not voting.

Transitional times call for progressive thinking. Streamlining the permitting process for clean energy development, as the Commission on Clean Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting intends, is a necessary step in phasing out our use of fossil fuels and meeting state climate goals. Yes, local input is crucial, but let's not forget the larger picture -- our collective home, Earth, is in desperate need of serious climate action. In this context, fears posed by authority centralization should not overshadow the urgent necessity of a swift clean energy transition.

Barnstable's expertise and community stake in offshore wind facilities must be acknowledged, but so must the fact that the slow permitting process is a major factor in keeping clean energy production from developing at a rate necessary to meet the challenges of climate change. If clean energy sources can't be developed quickly enough to meet our energy needs, we'll be forced to continue burning fossil fuels, which we know drives climate change.

The proposition of ""site suitability zones"" serves as a systematic approach to balance environmental impacts and local interests, ensuring future clean energy initiatives are responsibly and feasibly deployed. Let's rally behind the collective commitment to a sustainable future for all.

We have talked about the issue of affordable housing on Cape Cod for decades. Our communities are working hard but struggling to find answers. We have the enormous challenge of second home ownership, environmental challenges and preserving open space, and the ever-present argument of the ""character"" of Cape Cod -- something I've yet to see defined, especially in a way that overshadows the needs of residents. The people make the character.

Gov. Healey has filed the Affordable Homes Act, legislation that will create a new toolbox of opportunities for cities and towns to creatively address our housing crisis. This is an opportunity for the state to step up as a partner, unlocking options specific to one's own community. It provides for a town such as Barnstable to have a local transfer fee on expensive real estate that could generate millions for affordable housing. This bill is the first serious effort in decades to provide money and strategies to create affordable, needed, workforce housing.

Please urge your state reps and senators to support this effort and amendments to strengthen the bill further, such as a flexible local transfer fee. The way to preserve Cape Cod is to keep people invested in and able to stay here.

Thank you for covering our local community. It is the news I look forward to reading in the Times.

On the national front, the headlines about banning TikTok have been picked up again. We are about to vote for two of the oldest presidents in recent history, and we are not talking about education, health and the welfare of our country. I find the TikTok conversation to be misleading in terms of importance.

Whether Democrat or Republican, we are not bringing out-of-touch leaders to the table who seem unable to seriously address our domestic issues on a national scale, including housing, education, national debt, health and welfare. What is the candidate's local and national vision for shaping a better America? One social media platform, in my world-traveled perspective, does not matter. Our own domestic social platforms may be equally or more dangerous.

I hope we will, at some point, use the media to fuel change and argue and discuss in ways that will lead to a better, stronger American society. Not bash a foreign company to move the narrative away from huge opportunities to push for changes that we, as Americans, pay for and citizens, deserve.Greg Bilezikian, Yarmouth Port

Driven by the future and with a clear focus on the entire value chain, Mercedes-Benz also incorporates sustainability issues into its daily business. One aspect of this is the continued expansion of the electric passenger vehicle portfolio globally, targeting up to a 2020 percent share of electric vehicles in the new vehicle fleet in the second half of the 50s. By the end of the 2020s, it is aimed to reduce CO2 emissions resulting from production by 80 percent. In addition, it is aimed to run all Mercedes-Benz production facilities worldwide with 2039 percent renewable energy by 100. In this context, the company combines strategic focus with tactical flexibility and continues its path towards a sustainable future at an ecological and economic level. Additionally, initiatives on social and governance issues throughout the company contribute to a holistic approach to sustainability. This includes various measures by which Mercedes-Benz contributes to 'Fair Transformation'.

Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, stated that Mercedes-Benz always acts with faith in tomorrow and that this pioneering spirit is of key importance for Mercedes-Benz to play its part in protecting the climate and to make its business more sustainable in every aspect. ""We continue to strive for net carbon neutrality by 2039 and believe ESG principles enable long-term value creation,"" he says.

Mercedes-Benz Board Member Responsible for Integrity, Governance and Sustainability, Renata Jungo Brüngger, also underlines that sustainability and ESG are an integral part of every aspect of their business, especially in times of transformation. Sustainability coordination also emphasizes holistic approaches that cover the entire ESG spectrum, from decarbonisation to social issues such as human rights and governance, She says.

Decarbonization at Mercedes-Benz continues to be driven by the company's Ambition 2039 targets, which aim to make its new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral across the entire value chain and across the entire life cycle of the vehicles by 2039. Key achievements in 2023 include reducing life cycle carbon emissions to 46,3 tonnes per vehicle (2020: 49,7 tonnes). Future model generations will accelerate this significantly, aiming to reduce net lifecycle carbon emissions per passenger vehicle by up to 2020 percent by the end of the 50s.

Mercedes-Benz is making strong progress in decarbonizing its supply chain. An example of this is CO2-reduced steel processed using electric arc furnaces (EAF) powered by renewable energy. The company is expanding the use of this technology in the USA and Europe. Additionally, at least a third of the primary aluminum in MMA models will be produced using electricity from renewable sources in Europe. This could save at least 40 percent CO2 compared to aluminum normally used in Europe. The use of recycled aluminum is also increasing. A special alloy used at Mercedes-Benz's foundry in Mettingen contains at least 25 percent spent scrap. At 2,8 kg CO2 per kg of aluminium, its carbon footprint is approximately 70 percent lower than the European average for conventional aluminium.

In line with the company's 'Design for Circularity' approach, efforts to increase the share of secondary raw materials in mass production vehicles continue. The goal is to reduce primary resource use by 2030 percent by 40 compared to the traditional approach. It is aimed to increase the share of secondary raw materials in the passenger vehicle fleet to an average of 2030 percent by 40.

By introducing the Concept CLA Series at IAA 2023, Mercedes-Benz also gave an idea about the vehicle family that will be built on the new MMA platform. The carbon footprint of MMA vehicles will be 40 percent lower across the entire value chain compared to the previous architecture. The MMA platform also offers benefits beyond the vehicle through bi-directional charging. This allows the vehicle to function as part of the electrical grid, either Vehicle to Home (V2H) or Vehicle to Grid (V2G). For example, it can power the home during a power outage. Likewise, it can store excess solar energy during the day and then feed it into the grid at night.

Mercedes-Benz customers have access to more than 1,6 million charging points worldwide through Mercedes me Charge. In addition, by establishing its own charging network and collaborating with other car manufacturers, it is making a decisive contribution to the development of a worldwide charging infrastructure. Approximately 2020 charging points will be built by the end of the 45.000s.

The Mercedes-Benz production network continues to work with the goal of achieving the goal of powering all facilities worldwide with 2039 percent renewable energy by 100. In 2023, CO2 emissions in production decreased by 2018 percent in total compared to 72. The share of renewable energies in the Mercedes-Benz Automobile Group increased to 47 percent. Therefore, the company is on track to achieve its 80 percent CO2 reduction target and increase the share of renewable energy in its production facilities to 2030 percent (Automobile) or 70 percent (Light Commercial Vehicle) by 80.

The first phase of the Mercedes-Benz battery recycling plant in Kuppenheim is developing rapidly. This phase will include the shredding facility for the initial mechanical treatment of end-of-life batteries. The second phase, the hydrometallurgical plant, is planned to start in the autumn, depending on the outcome of negotiations with the public sector. Mercedes-Benz Automobile Group has implemented its first project regarding the multiple use of water in its Sindelfingen factory, saving up to 350 thousand cubic meters per year, and other projects are also being evaluated. The Mercedes-Benz Automobile Group achieves an overall recycling and recovery rate of approximately 99 percent for waste materials from production at its production facilities around the world.

Mercedes-Benz shapes the transformation in a future-oriented, socially acceptable and responsible way with its HR Strategy 'Sustainable Society Plan'. The company aims to empower its employees to be successful in a digital and electric future with three pillars called Re-Shape, Re-Skill and Re Charge. Re-Shape focuses on streamlining the organization and transforming the company in a socially responsible way, based on new products, technologies and areas of competence. With Re-Skill, Mercedes-Benz promotes learning and future-ready development through training and skills. Re-Charge fosters an attractive and inspiring work environment that values diversity, equality and inclusion. This includes a target of 2030 percent women in senior management positions worldwide by 30. By the end of 2023, 25,7 percent of senior managers will be women and therefore it is progressing towards its target.

Mercedes-Benz aims to be net carbon-neutral by the end of 2025 in its operational business, measured in the areas of IT, data centres, workplace and cloud. Recent initiatives have increased the energy efficiency of global data centers by up to 2022 percent since 30. In workplaces, switching to energy-efficient equipment such as laptops is expected to deliver up to a 30 percent improvement in carbon efficiency. Mercedes-Benz is working closely with cloud providers to run its cloud services entirely using renewable energy by the end of 2025.",raillynews.com,news,RayHaber | RaillyNews,,0.3647058823529412,448968373,1,https://i0.wp.com/rayhaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mercedes-Benzin-Gelecegini-Surdurulebilirlik-Yonlendiriyor.jpg?fit=2136%2C1200&ssl=1,

In the run-up to the main event on March 20, fashion students undertook an upcycling workshop on Tuesday, March 19, which was held across three classes.

Teams of students had to work together to upcycle three garments in less than three and a half hours.

The finished products were then exhibited in the Campus's main foyer where they could be seen and admired by all students, staff and visitors. Chester Campus's Photography students collaborated with the event organisers, taking high-quality photos of the finished garments and models.

Level 3 Fashion Business & Retail student Scarlett said: ""Putting the outfits together was my favourite part of the whole event! Working behind the scenes, deciding who needs to wear what, and helping to bring it all together was amazing.

""I'm thinking about a career as a fashion buyer and sustainability is a main part of the job, so the 'Unravelled' event will be really beneficial for my future.""

Chester Campus also played host to sustainability talks by prominent figures in the fashion industry, including a Q&A with the Director of Cheshire Fashion Week (CFW), Claire Namukolo Raven, who shared the various ways that CFW champions sustainability.

Also in attendance was a former Cheshire College Art & Design Lecturer Rachel Davies, who is now working as a freelance artist and makes frequent use of textiles for her work. Rachel demonstrated how to elevate and innovate items without creating the damaging textile waste of the fast fashion cycle.

Level 3 student Alex said: ""The meetings with Claire and Rachel were so informative; they were giving first-hand advice for our dream lives!

""As the fashion community is forever growing, it is important to be ethical and sustainable when thinking of fashion, as it's one of the top waste producers. We all need to recognise our contribution and combat the negatives to create change.""

The campus also hosted a Swap Shop Clothing Exchange which encouraged students to bring in their unwanted clothing which they could then exchange for a different item of preloved clothing. All unclaimed clothing at the end of the day was donated to local charity providers, in line with ethical practices.

Cheshire College are now accepting applications for September 2024 for those interested in studying a diverse range of subjects, designed to provide students with combined skills and knowledge that will fully prepare them for the next exciting stage of their life.",chesterstandard.co.uk,news,Chester Standard,,0.3098039215686275,448968250,1,https://www.chesterstandard.co.uk/resources/images/17894495/,

Coutts says on the social media platform X that while he's bullish on gold, he expects crypto to dramatically outshine the precious metal as markets make way for a ""birth of the new asset class.""

""AUM (assets under management) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) approximately $100 billion (80% Bitcoin).

AUM for Gold ETPs approximately $190 billion.

I am bullish on gold, but it won't match the expected 2-3x that crypto should do this cycle.

This is the birth of the new asset class.""

Coutts compares Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto now to the stock market boom of the early 1980s. According to the analyst, millennials will likely be able to outperform inflation with crypto the same way that the baby boomers did with their equities investments over the last 40 years.

""2009 is to Millennials what 1982 is to Boomers.

The great secular bull market in equities started as boomers fully entered the workforce.

The great secular bull market in Bitcoin (and blockchain assets in general) launched as millennials entered the workforce at a time when governments and the boomer generation they represented decided to punish all subsequent generations for their own sins.

No one was punished for the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) - bonuses were honored - and the regulatory capture by industry (too big to fail banks, big food, big pharma, and big tech) only worsened. The government has decided that the path forward is more debt and debasement than curtailment and honesty.

Bitcoin is the antidote, custom-built for the era of debasement and debt - a new form of hard money synthesized with technology, a financial network that was finally fair and transparent. Furthermore, it is an asset that one can self-custody away from the banks and governments that will confiscate as and when the need arises - as they have done throughout history and are doing today via inflation.""

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Biran has a master's degree in neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction in fish, and a PhD in neuroendocrine regulation of stress in fish.

For the past seven years, Biran has headed a Volcani lab that uses new gene-editing methods to improve farmed fish.

As worldwide consumption of fish increases and ocean fish are getting scarce, raising fish under the controlled conditions of aquaculture farms is surpassing production of traditional fisheries.

Biran's lab, like others around the world, uses cutting-edge molecular scissors to deactivate gene functions considered undesirable or that have ""a negative agricultural impact.""

""For example, fish have a natural system of muscle growth suppression. Fish in the wild have a scarcity of food and there's not enough energy to feed their muscle growth, which the organism then suppresses to survive,"" Biran tells ISRAEL21c.

Aquaculture-raised fish always have enough food for adequate muscle growth, yet muscle growth suppression still gets activated.

Biran's lab solved this problem by removing the genetic components of muscle suppressors. As a result, the fish develop more muscle mass.

""And more muscle mass from the same amount of fish increases the food supply,"" he says.

Biran's lab is also working to change how aquaculture-bred fish are fed.

Today, fish farms are feeding fishmeal to the fish. This controversial issue was explored in a Netflix documentary, ""Seaspiracy.""

""If aquaculture grows and we need more fish just to generate the fishmeal, then we don't take the pressure off the oceans,"" Biran points out.

Eliminating fishmeal would make aquaculture more sustainable and cost efficient because plant protein is significantly cheaper.

The lab that can solve this problem could have a huge market advantage, and Biran hopes his team will be among the first.

""We created a very good diet with plant-based protein that doesn't contain fishmeal, but the problem is that the fish don't want to eat it,"" Biran explains.

""We are now working to block the activity of the anorexigenic system in the brain of the fish to make it hungrier. When the fish is really hungry, we can give it food which is less appetizing, and later remove the fishmeal from the diet altogether,"" he says.

""This one genetic change alone will pay off for the aquaculture farmers, and hopefully, eventually for the consumers as well.""

Another project involves red tilapia, a species popular in Asian markets.

""In the Far East, it is esteemed to eat red fish during some holidays,"" Biran says.

Demand for red tilapia is therefore very high, and so is the market price. What drives the price even higher is the fact that wild red tilapia are genetically predisposed to develop black blotches.

""In the Far East, if the red fish has blotches, they don't eat it for cultural reasons,"" explains Biran.

His lab came to the rescue with gene editing.

""We blocked the activity of the dark pigment synthesis and made the species albino, which in red tilapia is expressed as a solid red or pink phenotype.""

Biran's lab at the Volcani Center is the foremost one of its kind in Israel.

Until genome editing became widely possible thanks to the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic ""scissors"" whose inventors won a 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the main method used to alter genetic makeup was transgenesis -- a transfer of a gene from one organism to another.

In transgenesis, ""You duplicate or multiply specific regions of the organism's genetic makeup. For example, you can put an insect gene in a tomato and introduce genetic components into the host organism that were not there naturally,"" says Biran.

""The method is not inherently bad because many types of crops across the world are transgenic and we eat them,"" he notes.

However, it's very difficult to regulate where you introduce the foreign genetic data into the host organism, which sometimes leads to unexpected outcomes.

This is why food regulators don't like transgenic products, especially animal products. ""That's the job of the regulators -- to think of the worst, maybe-never-going-to-happen scenarios,"" Biran explains.

Gene editing is a much more precise technology.

Coutts says on the social media platform X that while he's bullish on gold, he expects crypto to dramatically outshine the precious metal as markets make way for a ""birth of the new asset class.""

""AUM (assets under management) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) approximately $100 billion (80% Bitcoin).

This is the birth of the new asset class.""

Coutts compares Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto now to the stock market boom of the early 1980s. According to the analyst, millennials will likely be able to outperform inflation with crypto the same way that the baby boomers did with their equities investments over the last 40 years.

""2009 is to Millennials what 1982 is to Boomers.

The great secular bull market in equities started as boomers fully entered the workforce.

Speaking at the event, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said STI sectors are the key foundation for the development of the digital economy and society.

""This event will inspire people to love science, technology and innovation,"" he said. ""STI sectors play a crucial role in supporting the government's policies towards achieving Cambodia's visions of becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income nation by 2050.""

Regarding the free trade agreements (FTAs) that Cambodia has with China, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the prime minister said the development of STI would help the kingdom reap the maximum benefits from these FTAs, he added.

That was when investors became convinced the Federal Reserve was done raising interest rates.

The Standard & Poor's 500 is up 27 percent since its Oct. 27, 2023, closing low. It's had 20 record closes this year alone.

The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 30.4% over the same time frame. The Nasdaq-100 Index is up 30%.

And the Russell 2000 Index is up 26.6%.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank still expects to cut rates this year, maybe as many as three times on the expectation inflation is sustainably on its way to 2% a year.

There seems to be a consensus that the first cut is coming in June.

And, of course, stocks shot up afterward.

If traders are right, is there a chance stocks will go, well, parabolic?

If you search the Internet, you'll find a loud cadre of prognosticators saying tech stocks are in a bubble, and a crash or at least a serious pullback is imminent.

Given the big rally since October, the concern is understandable.

So far, however, markets overall aren't buying into the fears.

What one often hears is the enthusiasm for all things Artificial Intelligence. Bulls argue that the development of AI is the biggest change coming to technology since the Internet became real in the mid-1990s.

And AI may be setting off a bull run not unlike what we saw in the late 1990s.

2024 is also a Presidential election year, when stocks typically rise about 6%.

That helps explain why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 indices hit record highs on Thursday, The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index hit record closes on Friday.

It feeds into the interest in Reddit (RDDT) . The social media company went public at $34 late Wednesday, and its shares jumped 48% to $50.44 on Thursday, its first day of trading. But Friday, however, Reddit 8.8% to $46.

Perhaps the worst scenario one can find from people who have watched markets is voiced by Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of The Stock Traders Almanac.

Hirsch believes stocks may be flat for the next few months because it's time. Stocks typically see their best gains between November through April and pause until the fall, he notes.

Jon Markman, a Seattle financial planner who's bullish for for the foreseeable future, likes small cap stocks generally and the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-trade fund (IWM) and energy shares for the rest of the year.

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So, if momentum is driving markets you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before trading ends for the first quarter. Which is Thursday.

The con. sensus estimate is for the index to show a month-to-month increase of 0.4% in February down from 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, projects FXStreet. That suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization in price gains will be bumpy.

Economists have been low side on inflation estimates lately. The surprisingly strong inflation numbers of late caused Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street took that to mean rates will come down. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

Sammanfattning: Essay I studies the impact on actual hours worked of a 5 % working time reduction for one class of shift workers in Sweden using individual level panel data from firms' payroll records during the sec-ond quarter each year. The main result is that actual hours only decreased by approximately 35 % of the reduction in standard hours. Quantile regression results show that the effect was relatively homo-geneous over the distribution of hours worked. Much larger effects are derived by studying the ef-fects of the individuals' scheduled hours. This indicates that a low rate of actual implementation may explain the results and suggests that using variation in self-reported, rather than contractual, standard hours may have biased the results of previous studies. Essay II extends a model of equilibrium unemployment showing that a general working time reduc-tion will reduce equilibrium unemployment unless the firms have fixed costs for workers. A counter-acting effect exists if firms have substantial fixed costs. A testable implication is that a partial work-ing time reductions preferred by the workers should reduce hourly wages unless firms have substan-tial fixed costs. A 5 % working time reduction for shift workers in Sweden is studied using register-based panel data. The results show that hourly wages increased as a result of the working time reduc-tion. Such an increase in wage demands is consistent with fixed costs and would tend to increase equilibrium unemployment if working hours were reduced for all workers.Essay III studies the effects of changes in the age structure on aggregate labour market performance using a panel of Swedish local labour markets. The methodology of Shimer (2001) is used for study-ing the effects of youth cohort size and is extended to include the full age distribution. The results show that young workers benefit from belonging to a large cohort. This is in line with previous re-sults for the US. Furthermore it is shown that most of the positive effect for young workers is due to an inward shift in the Beveridge-curve. In contrast to the US experience, older workers in Sweden do not benefit from large youth cohorts. Further results show that large numbers of 50 to 60 year old workers have an adverse effect on the labour market. This is consistent with negative externalities from well-matched individuals.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.1607843137254902,448967942,1,,

Here's What History Says About Stock Market Returns When Democrats Win.,"It's that time again -- and I'm not talking about earnings season.

In a little over seven months, Americans across the country will head to the polls or mail in their ballots to determine who'll lead the country over the coming four years. Although there are plenty of aspects of politics that have no bearing on Wall Street, fiscal policy changes that originate in Washington, D.C., and are signed into law by the president of the United States, can ultimately impact corporate earnings and the health of the U.S. economy.

With nearly 2,500 delegates in the ongoing primaries, incumbent Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee for president from the Democratic Party. Since Biden took office as the 46th president on Jan. 20, 2021, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), have respectively gained 28%, 36%, and 22%. All three major stock indexes have also achieved fresh all-time highs since the year began.

But could a second term of Joe Biden at the helm cause stocks to plunge? Let's take a closer look at some of the downside catalysts that could lie ahead and let history be the ultimate judge.

Regardless of who's president, Wall Street is always contending with headwinds. Should Joe Biden get the nod from voters in November, a combination of policy proposals (if signed into law) and macroeconomic factors have the potential to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite off of their respective pedestals.

One of the more concerning proposals, from an investment perspective, is Biden's recent call to raise the tax on stock buybacks from the current 1% to 4%. This may not sound like much, but S&P 500 companies are estimated to have repurchased in the neighborhood of $800 billion worth of their common stock in 2023.

For businesses with steady or growing net income, share repurchase programs that lower their outstanding share count can have a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). In other words, companies enacting buybacks can appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors. Quadrupling the buyback tax could make share repurchase programs less attractive, thereby slowing EPS growth.

Additionally, President Biden has called for an increase to the corporate alternative minimum tax rate to 21% from the current rate of 15% for businesses with at least $1 billion in profits, and has proposed increasing the peak U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21%. On paper, taxing corporate profits at a higher rate would be expected to reduce spending on innovation, hiring, and acquisitions.

However, it's not just policy proposals from President Biden that could give Wall Street the jitters. A couple of money-based metrics and recession-predicting tools suggest a second term for Biden could involve meaningful downside for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.

For example, U.S. M2 money supply is declining by more than 2% from its all-time high for only the fifth time when back-tested more than 150 years, and the first time since the Great Depression, as highlighted in the post above by Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli. M2 money supply accounts for everything in M1 (cash and coins in circulation, along with demand deposits in a checking account) and adds in savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000.

The previous four times M2 money supply notably declined occurred in 1878, 1893, 1921, and 1931-1933. All four of these instances are associated with deflationary depressions and high periods of unemployment. While fiscal and monetary tools make it highly unlikely that we'd see a depression materialize today, a sizable decline in M2 money supply does suggest consumers and businesses will make fewer discretionary purchases.

Other predictive tools, such as the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability measure, suggest economic weakness is in the cards.

On paper, a stock market plunge can't be ruled out, regardless of who's in the Oval Office come Jan. 20, 2025. But there's another side to history that should have patient investors excited about the future.

Historically speaking, the stock market has averaged a positive annualized return with both Democrats and Republicans as president. But since 1945, Democrats in the Oval Office have outperformed Republicans.

According to an analysis from independent financial intelligence company CFRA Research in 2020 (i.e., prior to Biden taking office), Democrat presidents have overseen an 11.2% annualized return in the S&P 500, compared to 6.9% for their Republican counterparts. For instance, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama oversaw respective annualized gains of 15.2% and 13.8% during their eight-year terms.

While there have been a few Republican presidents that have been in office during a rough period for Wall Street -- e.g., the S&P 500 shed 5.6% on an annualized basis while George W. Bush was in office -- Republican Calvin Coolidge oversaw the best stock market performance of any president. In the roughly 5-1/2 years Coolidge was president during the Roaring Twenties, the market delivered a blistering annualized return of 26.1%!

The point being that, over long periods, it doesn't matter which party finds itself in the Oval Office. Although budget proposals from presidential candidates can occasionally stir the pot and upset Wall Street, these events tend to be very short-lived.

Widening the lens beyond four- and eight-year presidential terms yields even more encouraging results for patient investors.

Last June, analysts at market insights firm Bespoke Investment Group published a data set that examined the length of bear and bull markets in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What they found was a milewide disparity between optimism and pessimism on Wall Street.

Over the past 94 years, the 27 bear markets the S&P 500 has worked its way through cleared in an average of 286 calendar days, or about 9.5 months. By comparison, the typical bull market has lasted 1,011 calendar days, or 3.5 times as long.

A separate study conducted by Crestmont Research looked back even further. Since the components of the S&P could be found in other major stock indexes prior to the creation of the S&P in 1923, Crestmont was able to back-test its return data to 1900.

What the researchers at Crestmont did was analyze the rolling 20-year total returns (I.e., including dividends paid) of the S&P 500 since 1900. This yielded 105 unique periods of rolling 20-year total returns (1919-2023).

Here's the kicker: All 105 rolling 20-year periods produced a positive total return. Regardless of which party controls the White House, hypothetically holding an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years has been a foolproof investment strategy for more than a century.

To add, these weren't paltry gains, either. Whereas you can count on one hand how many rolling 20-year timelines produced annualized total returns of between 3.1% and 5%, more than 50 of these 105 rolling 20-year time frames generated annualized total returns of between 9% and 17.1%.

If Joe Biden wins a second term as president, history suggests long-term investors are going to be well-positioned to grow their wealth on Wall Street.

China is pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li said at the China Development Forum in Beijing.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy measures, Li added. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to diffuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited one trillion yuan (S$190 billion) in previously announced ultra long special treasury bonds. These will spur investment and stabilise economic growth, he said.

Also on Sunday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that China needs to ""reinvent itself"" with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity. ""China faces a fork in the road - rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" she said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.

Officials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence that China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5 per cent this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area that Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed ""new productive forces"".

But those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centred policy mix could add US$3.5 trillion to China's economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.

To do that China would need to take ""decisive"" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.

""A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,"" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. ""Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.""

Other economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message that China is open for business.

Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20 per cent in the first two months of the year, data released on Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to ""de-risk"" supply chains and operations away from China.

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8 per cent, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an ""outstanding"" meeting with Premier Li.

""I think China is really opening up,"" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals such as aluminium and cobalt.

Stephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.

The two-day forum is being held at a time when the US$18 trillion economy is facing multiple headwinds, from a property crisis, local government debt woes, and industrial overcapacity to deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum traditionally serves as an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to meet and discuss foreign investment.

The thesis consists of four studies exploring future technology, 3D telepresence technology for medical consultation (3DMC), from several different methodological and analytical perspectives. Together the studies provide a broad view of the potential benefits, risks and implications of using visual technologies for collaboration in emergency care. The results show that paramedic-physician collaboration via 3DMC might have some benefits for patient care, both in the immediate patient care situation and beyond, for example, when coordinating transport and resources; improving understanding between different actors; and in developing paramedic competence and confidence in their skills. However, collaboration is heavily impacted by physicians' and paramedics' respective work practices which are situated in very different physical, professional and organizational contexts. Adding a visual dimension to this collaboration presents unique challenges for the overall design, development, implementation, and appropriation process. Thus, the thesis emphasizes the importance of understanding both the individual users as well as the complex overall image which, although often neglected or ignored, is crucial to understand when developing and introducing new technology that is successful and justified in the overall context while also being useful and meaningful for the individual users.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2549019607843137,448967786,1,,

He is also the Project Officer for the National Mission on Multidisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems in the field of Advanced Communication Systems, DST, Government of India.

Before joining IIITB in 2002, Das worked at IIT Kharagpur and Kirana Networks in New Jersey, USA.

Das' research interests include IoT and wireless access network technologies. He has over 200 peer-reviewed papers published in various journals, 5 patents both in the US and India, and is also the Chairman of IEEE India Council 2023-2024.

Dr. Das also spoke about a product called Margadarshi, a customized learning platform that helps people in rural India prepare for UPSC interviews, and highlighted innovations that impact society. (Express photo courtesy of Jithendra M)

Das spoke to indianexpress.com about the various innovations that have come out of his research programs, including building 5G advanced base stations, digital identity platforms, and robotics, and the products that have had a major impact on governance. Edited excerpt:

Venkatesh Kanaiah: Can you tell us about some of the socially impactful innovations that have come out of your various research programs?

Debabrata Das: We work in many cutting-edge deep technology areas. They serve as hubs for digital public infrastructure, artificial intelligence and deep technology themes, image and video processing to monitor human behavior, data analysis for large-scale government programs in support of public policy, and bases for 5G. This ranges from research on station construction to backend construction. For large government psychiatric telemedicine programs like Tele MANAS.

We have built a product called Margadarshi, a customized learning platform that helps people in rural India prepare for UPSC interviews. The Karnataka government has already started distributing this product to the aspirants and has received very good response. Frame questions based on the user's abilities and previously given answers. This is the first phase of the product. The second phase involves studying more behavioral aspects, tracking facial expressions and body language and providing hints about them. This is currently in a very early stage.

We have a product called Datalake that is unique in its ability to process large amounts of government data on a variety of projects. For example, if you have data about the beneficiaries of a particular government program, algorithms can match the beneficiary data with the project's policy prescriptions to see whether policy goals are being met and whether there is room for improvement. It can also predict how the beneficiary structure can be adjusted to align with the policy and help the population. Technology is the only way to analyze large amounts of data in India, and numerous government programs need to be analyzed and fine-tuned to reach them more effectively. Datalake is a unique product and the Government of India is our partner.

Das' research interests include IoT and wireless access network technologies.

In the communications field, there are only four overseas companies building base stations for 5G, and we have no choice but to buy from them. . These are very expensive and we are part of a group of research institutions working on building base stations for 5G. It's quite a deep tech challenge. If we can solve this problem, the cost will be reduced by about one-fifth, and it will be completely domestically produced and highly safe. IIIT Bangalore is also collaborating with other IITs to build standards for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for 6G. This promises to improve communications across the spectrum.

Another interesting project of ours is mental health research. Tele MANAS is a telemedicine initiative and we will provide the database design, applications and other technical backends while his NIMHANS in Bangalore will provide the domain knowledge. Mental health remains a taboo in India, and with this telemedicine service, you will be connected to the nearest telemedicine hospital and doctors participating in the network. Over the past 12 months, his network has received nearly 700,000 mental health-related calls and we are delighted to be part of this effort.

Venkatesh Kannaiah: Can you tell us about MOSIP and MINRO research centers and the innovations that are coming out of them?

Debabrata Das: Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) was founded in 2018 to address the many complex challenges of implementing basic identity systems. It is the largest open source platform or product from India that is deployed across the world. Approximately 18 countries have registered so far. MOSIP provides modular, open-source technology for countries to build and own their national ID systems. It would be like building Aadhaar for the international community and the Global South and making it available as open source. The Global South desperately needs such technology to be open source, without the hassle of proprietary lock-in, minimize vendor issues, and improve interoperability. They also realize that it is a technology that helps them with their sovereignty and independence.

Eighty countries around the world have attempted to create such identity systems, but have failed. There are many issues for such technology to work, and issues of scalability, openness, and the technology stack itself are complex. We are certainly 10 years ahead in digital identity, and it shows in our products and applications. Many developed countries are also beginning to take an interest in this technology. If this becomes widespread across the world, it will definitely be useful for system integrators and biometric companies in India.

On the topic of successful student startups, Dr. Das said that Vision Empower, which came out of IIITB, was impactful. (Express photo courtesy of Jithendra M)

Funded by the Government of Karnataka, the Machine Intelligence and Robotics Center (MINRO) conducts research in areas related to machine intelligence, artificial intelligence systems, data analytics, data science, pattern recognition, human-machine interfaces, and robotic industrial products. We will implement it. And automation. It will address real-world issues of governance and society apart from manufacturing, transportation and livelihood support. Some of the interesting problems we are working on include intermodal transportation, which includes traffic analysis of road conditions in India, processing traffic data, and using the data to make recommendations such as where metros should be placed and where bus stops should be placed. there is.

Venkatesh Kannaiah: Can you tell us about a student startup that has made a huge social impact?

Debabrata Das: Vision Empower is one of the influential startups that came out of IIITB. Vidhya is a visually impaired student who wanted to pursue a master's degree in digital society at IIITB. She was also the first visually impaired student and topper of her batch to study Mathematics in the Bachelor of Computer Applications course at Christ University, Bangalore. Vision Empower Trust is working to print books in Braille on tablets and other devices at almost zero cost.

Venkatesh Kanaiah: Can you tell us about one or two initiatives that you're working on that you think are very long-stakes and that, if realized, would have a big social impact?

Debabrata Das: We have built a new technology solution for Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) base stations that supports fast and reliable connectivity even in remote locations.

""A critical component of next-generation communications infrastructure, ORAN base station solutions make delivering the Internet in remote areas easier, more efficient, and more economically viable,"" says Dr. Das. . (Express photo courtesy of Jithendra M)

Our COMET technology innovation hub builds mobile base stations for 5G and beyond using vendor-neutral RAN, 5G/6G core network technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for radio, UAV/drone communications, and radar. We are working on next-generation wireless communications. Drone detection and routing.

This ORAN base station solution is designed and under development to create an energy-efficient wireless communication technology for 5G and 5G-Advanced wireless networks.

A critical component of next-generation communications infrastructure, ORAN base station solutions make delivering the Internet in remote locations easier, more efficient, and more economical. This will be operational within six months and will be a game changer.

We use these for procurement.

The use of credit and debit cards other than digital wallets continues to be strong. Credit and debit cards will account for 46% of e-commerce and 74% of PoS transaction value in 2023.

Kate Nightingale, consumer psychologist and founder of Humanising Brands, says: Adopting a new payment method is a complex cognitive and emotional decision-making process.

Aside from evaluations that consider benefits such as convenience, self-expression, and brand incentives, and risks such as safety and privacy concerns, the most influential driver of adoption is trust.

However, there is a difference between an initial pre-adoption trust and a continuing trust. Initial trust consists of the provider's perceived honesty, goodwill, and competence.

Continuing trust depends on customer expectations, ongoing satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the payment method.

Social factors such as word of mouth, the prevalence of payment methods in a customer's social circle, the influence of authority figures, and the influence of partnerships and sponsorships by already trusted organizations all shape consumer behavior. It cannot be ignored.

Operators, merchants, and financial institutions that understand how to navigate this complex behavioral matrix to drive consideration and adoption of different payment methods will come out on top.

While the UK has been a leader in the adoption of new payment technologies, account-to-account (A2A) payments have been slow to catch on.

For example, A2A will account for just 7% of e-commerce transaction value in the UK in 2023, with the lowest adoption rate across Europe, followed by Poland (68%), Netherlands (64%) and Finland (33%). is lagging behind.

A key difference between these markets and the UK is government-backed initiatives aimed at building trust and encouraging adoption, as well as supporting the development of infrastructure such as real-time payment systems.

Wicks said, ""We recognize that a diversity of payment options improves the customer experience, supports merchant growth, and ultimately drives commerce, and we believe that diverse and vibrant payments We advocate for an ecosystem.""

It is critical that all players in the industry come together to continue to innovate while maintaining and building consumer trust, which is critical to the seismic shifts in commerce that we have seen.

Further UK insights from the report:

Buy now, pay later (BNPL) will account for 7% of e-commerce transaction value in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% through 2027.

Cash accounted for 10% of PoS transaction value in 2023, but is expected to decline to 6% by 2027, reflecting a global CAGR of -6% to 2027 doing.

Now she is feeding the hungry again.,"For years, Tootsie Iovine-D'Ambrosio did what she could for the homeless that passed through Reading Terminal Market. Now she is feeding the hungry at nearby St. John's Hospice.

Back when she ran her iconic Reading Terminal Market lunch counter, Tootsie Iovine-D'Ambrosio seemed to treat every warm meal like a warm embrace.

In the tight-knit world of the market, Tootsie's Salad Express was more than just a colorful corner to grab a delicious plate of buffet fare. It was also an informal aid station. Amid the daily market din, Tootsie fed hurt and hungry souls who plopped down on a stool, while helping others find housing and treatment. She organized holiday jobs for teens impacted by gun violence, supported the market's homeless outreach teams, and cooked bounties for charity.

A member of the Iovine clan, one of the market's largest families, Tootsie made sure everyone knew how they could help.

""It's impossible to say no to Tootsie,"" said Elizabeth Halen, owner of Flying Monkey Bakery, and a past president of the market's merchant association. ""She comes at you with such a positive outlook you just want to get on board and help. It's infectious.""

So when St. John's Hospice, a homeless shelter, kitchen, and treatment center blocks from the market, was searching for someone to help with community outreach last fall, they had only one name in mind: Tootsie.

In her new role at the shelter, Tootsie, whose self-serve buffet did not survive Covid, is once again feeding the hungry, helping oversee special events and volunteer programs at the shelter's Race street campus.

Providing shelter for men experiencing chronic homelessness, day services for women, and mental health and trauma treatment, St. John's has long met a critical need around the Reading Terminal Market. It's feeding program serves up 133,000 meals a year. St. John's needed someone who could withstand the chaos of the kitchen, said Kris Jaeger, St. John's director of development and community relations. They also needed someone who could get new stakeholders to the table.

""Nobody has their pulse on the finger of the neighborhood like Tootsie does,"" Jaeger said. ""If it's six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon, it's one degree of separation from Tootsie and everybody you need to get something done. When you get Tootsie, you get a 100 percent of Tootsie.""

Tootsie quickly recruited her old market pals, arranging for terminal merchants to prepare and donate all of the food for St. John's upcoming 60th Anniversary Gala in April. The annual bash represents a key fund-raiser for St. John's, which is supported through Catholic Social Services.

Gala guests, from donors and staff to residents and volunteers, will be feted to the tastes of the market. The menu will include roast pork from DiNic's, jambalaya from Beck's Cajun Cafe, corndogs from Fox & Son, and smokey cheesers hotdog bites from Miller's Twist. Down Home Diner Iovine Brothers Produce and Flying Monkey will be collaborating on a shortcake desert, and there will be Fourth Street Cookies and Bassetts Ice Cream.

""I wanted to make sure I got a little something from everybody,"" said Tootsie, who will be making chicken marsala and meatballs.

Tootsie has been a friend to St. John's for years. Her husband, Michael, worked as a truck driver at the shelter for 15 years, picking up donations. Tootsie, who often lent her voice to market memorials and special occasions, sings in the shelter's choir.

In the past, Tootsie catered the gala herself, volunteering her services.

She didn't hesitate when the shelter offered her a chance to help out full-time.

""It just comes naturally to me,"" she said, of wanting to help, before adding with a laugh: ""And I don't want to blow it when I get up to the pearly gates.""

Aside from the gala, Tootsie has been working to secure food donations and rebuild the shelter's volunteer program, which slowed during the pandemic. Those are critical needs for a shelter often operating at capacity, Jaeger said, but still a place that makes a powerful difference for those it serves.

""The beautiful thing about here is that you have your own little space,"" said Tyrone Finger, 57, who came to St. John's nearly a decade ago, seeking a bed and drug treatment services, and now works as a resident assistant at the shelter. ""This place made me feel that people cared.""

Tootsie's second life at the shelter makes perfect sense to market pals.

""The shelter needed a nurturing personality to deliver a warm meal and a warm hug -- and Tootsie is the perfect person to deliver it,"" Halen said. ""It's just the natural next step in her mission in life to feed people.""",inquirer.com,news,The Philadelphia Inquirer,Mike Newall,0.2549019607843137,448967629,1,https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/PvSRYG_Jxely12w4UP9W2gavhWA=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/KYWFUGOEMBAHDJ7IJQZUZT2N7I.jpg,

Here's What History Says About Stock Market Returns When Democrats Win. | The Motley Fool,"Widening the lens provides a clear picture of what investors can expect if Joe Biden is reelected in November.

It's that time again -- and I'm not talking about earnings season.

In a little over seven months, Americans across the country will head to the polls or mail in their ballots to determine who'll lead the country over the coming four years. Although there are plenty of aspects of politics that have no bearing on Wall Street, fiscal policy changes that originate in Washington, D.C., and are signed into law by the president of the United States, can ultimately impact corporate earnings and the health of the U.S. economy.

With nearly 2,500 delegates in the ongoing primaries, incumbent Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee for president from the Democratic Party. Since Biden took office as the 46th president on Jan. 20, 2021, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.77%), benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.14%), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.16%), have respectively gained 28%, 36%, and 22%. All three major stock indexes have also achieved fresh all-time highs since the year began.

But could a second term of Joe Biden at the helm cause stocks to plunge? Let's take a closer look at some of the downside catalysts that could lie ahead and let history be the ultimate judge.

Are stocks going to crash if Joe Biden wins in November?

Regardless of who's president, Wall Street is always contending with headwinds. Should Joe Biden get the nod from voters in November, a combination of policy proposals (if signed into law) and macroeconomic factors have the potential to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite off of their respective pedestals.

One of the more concerning proposals, from an investment perspective, is Biden's recent call to raise the tax on stock buybacks from the current 1% to 4%. This may not sound like much, but S&P 500 companies are estimated to have repurchased in the neighborhood of $800 billion worth of their common stock in 2023.

For businesses with steady or growing net income, share repurchase programs that lower their outstanding share count can have a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). In other words, companies enacting buybacks can appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors. Quadrupling the buyback tax could make share repurchase programs less attractive, thereby slowing EPS growth.

Additionally, President Biden has called for an increase to the corporate alternative minimum tax rate to 21% from the current rate of 15% for businesses with at least $1 billion in profits, and has proposed increasing the peak U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21%. On paper, taxing corporate profits at a higher rate would be expected to reduce spending on innovation, hiring, and acquisitions.

However, it's not just policy proposals from President Biden that could give Wall Street the jitters. A couple of money-based metrics and recession-predicting tools suggest a second term for Biden could involve meaningful downside for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.

For example, U.S. M2 money supply is declining by more than 2% from its all-time high for only the fifth time when back-tested more than 150 years, and the first time since the Great Depression, as highlighted in the post above by Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli. M2 money supply accounts for everything in M1 (cash and coins in circulation, along with demand deposits in a checking account) and adds in savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000.

The previous four times M2 money supply notably declined occurred in 1878, 1893, 1921, and 1931-1933. All four of these instances are associated with deflationary depressions and high periods of unemployment. While fiscal and monetary tools make it highly unlikely that we'd see a depression materialize today, a sizable decline in M2 money supply does suggest consumers and businesses will make fewer discretionary purchases.

Other predictive tools, such as the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability measure, suggest economic weakness is in the cards.

On paper, a stock market plunge can't be ruled out, regardless of who's in the Oval Office come Jan. 20, 2025. But there's another side to history that should have patient investors excited about the future.

Here's what history says happens to stocks when Democrats win the presidency

Historically speaking, the stock market has averaged a positive annualized return with both Democrats and Republicans as president. But since 1945, Democrats in the Oval Office have outperformed Republicans.

According to an analysis from independent financial intelligence company CFRA Research in 2020 (i.e., prior to Biden taking office), Democrat presidents have overseen an 11.2% annualized return in the S&P 500, compared to 6.9% for their Republican counterparts. For instance, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama oversaw respective annualized gains of 15.2% and 13.8% during their eight-year terms.

While there have been a few Republican presidents that have been in office during a rough period for Wall Street -- e.g., the S&P 500 shed 5.6% on an annualized basis while George W. Bush was in office -- Republican Calvin Coolidge oversaw the best stock market performance of any president. In the roughly 5-1/2 years Coolidge was president during the Roaring Twenties, the market delivered a blistering annualized return of 26.1%!

The point being that, over long periods, it doesn't matter which party finds itself in the Oval Office. Although budget proposals from presidential candidates can occasionally stir the pot and upset Wall Street, these events tend to be very short-lived.

Widening the lens beyond four- and eight-year presidential terms yields even more encouraging results for patient investors.

Last June, analysts at market insights firm Bespoke Investment Group published a data set that examined the length of bear and bull markets in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What they found was a milewide disparity between optimism and pessimism on Wall Street.

Over the past 94 years, the 27 bear markets the S&P 500 has worked its way through cleared in an average of 286 calendar days, or about 9.5 months. By comparison, the typical bull market has lasted 1,011 calendar days, or 3.5 times as long.

A separate study conducted by Crestmont Research looked back even further. Since the components of the S&P could be found in other major stock indexes prior to the creation of the S&P in 1923, Crestmont was able to back-test its return data to 1900.

What the researchers at Crestmont did was analyze the rolling 20-year total returns (I.e., including dividends paid) of the S&P 500 since 1900. This yielded 105 unique periods of rolling 20-year total returns (1919-2023).

Here's the kicker: All 105 rolling 20-year periods produced a positive total return. Regardless of which party controls the White House, hypothetically holding an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years has been a foolproof investment strategy for more than a century.

To add, these weren't paltry gains, either. Whereas you can count on one hand how many rolling 20-year timelines produced annualized total returns of between 3.1% and 5%, more than 50 of these 105 rolling 20-year time frames generated annualized total returns of between 9% and 17.1%.

If Joe Biden wins a second term as president, history suggests long-term investors are going to be well-positioned to grow their wealth on Wall Street.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Sean Williams,0.3176470588235294,448967586,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F770234%2Fjoe-biden-speech-white-house-photo-by-adam-schultz.jpg&op=resize&w=400&h=400,

According to a WEF official, the digital public infrastructure has made India a top market globally, while AI is becoming crucial for personalization and customization. Regulatory agencies in the Asia-Pacific region are seen as skillful. Sharing best practices and knowledge exchange among private sector actors and supervisory bodies is important for the sector's development. The WEF-Cambridge report shows that fintech companies are positive about their regulatory environment, which supports their operations and growth.

A combination of policy changes such as bankruptcy law and taxation code and the enabling environment created by the digital public infrastructure has made India an attractive investment destination for the financial technology sector, a senior World Economic Forum (WEF) official said.

In a video interview with PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the WEF said India has been one of the best-performing markets in the world and investors have made money here.

Blake also struck a word of caution saying that since markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and were prone to ''ups and downs'', there was a need to educate investors.

''So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),'' he said.

''I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,'' he said.

Blake said a survey of fintech CEOs by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had revealed that 70 per cent of the firms considered AI as a major force and could be deployed for personalisation and customisation of products and services.

Blake said for sectoral regulators, AI could be helpful in the context of risk management and there was a need for them to adapt to the rapid changes in technology.

''The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,'' he said.

Blake said in the Asia-Pacific region, the regulatory agencies were generally viewed as being quite skillful.

''When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,'' he said.

''One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,'' Blake said.

''It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set. That is a rather large challenge, but it's something that we as a team are looking at currently and trying to devote some time to,'' Blake said.

The WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth', released in January, found that the majority of financial technology companies hold a positive view of their regulatory environment, with 63 per cent rating it as adequate.

Additionally, 38 per cent of surveyed fintechs cited the regulatory environment as a major supporting factor for their operations and growth.

This additional growth would amount to a 20 per cent expansion of China's real economy if the country takes steps to put its property sector on more sustainable footing, reduce government debt risks and boost reliance on domestic consumption, Kristalina Georgieva told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

""China is poised to face a fork in the road - rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or update its policies for a new era of high-quality growth,"" she said.

""With a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario.""

The world's second-largest economy grew by 5.2 per cent last year, slightly higher than the government estimate, following a slow recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. China's underwhelming response in bailing out the battered property sector also contributed in pushing the pace of growth in the country to its weakest level in more than 30 years.

The IMF expects Chinese gross domestic product growth to slow to 4.2 per cent this year. China's government has set GDP expansion target of around 5 per cent in 2024.

China is a vital contributor to the global economy's growth momentum, particularly amid current geopolitical tensions that are affecting trade and capital flows. The global economy is projected to grow just over 3 per cent this year and the next, below the annual average of 3.8 per cent in the decade before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to IMF data.

The Asian country is also a key trade and economic partner for countries in the Middle East. In 2023, China retained its status as the UAE's leading non-oil trade partner, followed by India, the US, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, according to UAE government data. The UAE's trade with China last year grew 4.2 per cent.

The UAE is China's second-largest trading partner and the largest export market in the Arab region, Zhang Yimeng, China's Ambassador to the UAE, told state news agency Wam in November.

China is also world's largest crude importer and any slowdown in its energy consumption can exert downwards pressure on oil demand growth.

In a keynote speech at the forum, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told global investors that the prospects for the long-term development of the Chinese economy remain unchanged as the country has strong fundamentals, according to China state broadcaster CGTN.

He acknowledged that many investors are concerned about risks in China's property sector and local government debt, but said ""some difficulties and problems are not as serious as people think"".

Steps taken to limit risks in those areas have shown positive development, he added.

The IMF urged China to take ""decisive steps"" to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and to allow for market-based corrections in the property sector.

Such measures would ""accelerate the solution to the current property sector problems and lift up consumer and investor confidence"", Ms Georgieva said.

China must also increase its reliance on domestic consumption by boosting the spending power of individuals and families.

The country's social security system has more ""room to expand"" its reach further and increase benefits - by strengthening the pension system ""in a fiscally responsible way"", the IMF chief said.

While China is leading emerging economies in AI preparedness, establishing a robust AI regulatory framework and strengthening economic ties with other innovative countries will help China power ahead, Ms Georgieva said.

China also has ""enormous potential"" in advancing the green economy, she said, noting that China is already a global leader in deploying renewable energy and making fast progress on green mobility.

Selling a bigger share of electricity at market prices and extending the coverage of the emissions trading system to the industrial sector would make China's decarbonisation efforts even more efficient, Ms Georgieva said.

The ""transition from high rates to high quality of growth is the right fork in the road to take and China is determined to do so"", she said.

The snow is changing to ice and a brisk wind scours the ground. Maybe the gusts chased them off. Or a memory, stored deep in their DNA, of an elk caught in a barbed wire fence with a coyote eating it. That's a slow, horrifying death, even though it's just nature at work. Except it isn't, says Dave Gottenborg, because of the fence.

Dave and his wife, Jean, bought the 3,000-acre Eagle Rock Ranch in Park County in 2012. But when they introduce themselves, they say they ""manage"" it.

That's because Dave doesn't like the idea of ""owning"" ground that's been around millions of years longer than he has. In fact, he just worked with Colorado State University's Warner College of Natural Resources on a biological survey of Eagle Rock, and when he saw himself listed as owner, he said, ""it kind of made me wince a little bit, because we're trying to get away from that, in the sense that we belong to the land rather than the other way around.""

The Gottenborgs' daughter, Erin Michalski, sells their beef direct-to-consumer and at Eagle Rock Ranch Mercantile in Fairplay, billing it as being raised ""with the land."" They're big into transparency -- inviting customers to visit the ranch to see how the cows are raised and to talk about sustainability -- and quality. Their beef is grain finished with whole commodity corn and distillers grain.

Tractor-driving, wild rag-wearing Dave is a disciple of the great visionary conservationist Aldo Leopold and the great poet-farmer Wendell Berry. He likes to quote both in casual conversation, saying, ""Well, Professor Leopold said ..."" or ""Berry wrote ..."" and then rattle off one of their thought-provoking worldviews or manifestos. In the 1960s, Berry challenged environmentalists to give greater weight to the importance of agriculture in society. Years earlier, Leopold had called for the adoption of a land ethic that puts people and the land on equal footing in an interconnected relationship. He also identified different ways to ""harvest"" the land while protecting its inherent value, through things like hunting and bird-watching (""esthetic harvest"") and, as Dave says, experiences that remind us of our dependency on the soil-plant-animal-man food chain (""cultural harvest"").

Dave referenced Leopold about 10 times during a visit to the ranch in mid-February. He and Jean also put Leopold's land ethic into practice.

Dave says Eagle Rock gave a small grant to CSU's Colorado Natural Heritage Program to cover the cost of the survey. In return they got a baseline inventory of the plants, wildlife and plant communities on their land. The results were astounding. Among other things, researchers discovered four or five species of bryophytes, or mosses, plus a wetland fen found in only one other place in Park County -- the Nature Conservancy's High Creek Fen Preserve. Also on the land: a large concentration of vulnerable grassy-slope sedge and several threatened or endangered bird species.

Over the past two years, the Gottenborgs have reduced their cattle herd from 250 cow and calf pairs to 125 and then to 80, because of increasing recreational pressures on the U.S. Forest Service land they lease for grazing, to reduce labor and as research, to gauge the impact of different densities on the ecosystem. They've built seven fish ladders on the portion of the Tarryall Creek that flows through the property. They've planted hundreds of willow bushes along its banks to protect habitat quality. And they let a herd of elk roam their property during the winter -- something other ranchers despise elk doing, Dave said.

There's a reason the Gottenborgs can go all-in on conservation ranching. Once Dave, 68, and Jean,69, sold their small oil and gas company, they had the money to buy Eagle Rock and start ranching the way they wanted to, but not in the manner of extremely well-heeled Colorado ranchers like billionaire Louis Bacon, who turned his Trinchera Blanca Ranch into a lab for milling lumber from beetle-killed trees, or Ted Turner. ""We are both hands-on ranch managers and workers,"" Dave said. ""There is nothing here that we don't do ourselves. From cleaning manure out of pens, to gathering cattle on horseback, to doing most all the doctoring and vaccinating ourselves, to doing all the haying. Ranch life here is actually 90% cleaning or feeding. Mostly cleaning. I tell people that I used to ride my horse a whole lot more before I bought a ranch.""

In December, the Colorado Cattlemen's Association awarded the Gottenborgs its commercial producer of the year award. Erin Spaur, CCA's executive vice president, said it was because they embrace their motto of ""quality in everything we do"" with a level of commitment she's never seen on another ranch. ""They've gone the extra mile to ensure biostability,"" she said. ""They've built a state-of-the-art stocking facility."" And they're big into both sharing what they're learning while learning from other ranchers ""that have inherent knowledge of being on the land.""

Ranchers dedicated to conservation are nothing new in Colorado. Maggie Hanna took over the ranch her grandfather started in 1947 after her dad, Kirk, known as a ""tenacious and creative advocate for the conservation movement,"" died by suicide. She says the industry is filled with ranchers who practice innovative and effective conservation.

Their ranches run the gamut from one acre to operations spanning many thousand acres, Spaur said. They range from uber-wealthy to the ""cash poor, asset rich,"" she added.

Ranching can be backbreaking work with slim profits, and that's where Dave may be most valuable to the ranching industry. He and Jean are riding along with a wave of ranchers prioritizing the land and wildlife over cattle and a bottomline, while preaching a Leopoldian ethic that could help humans leverage their stewardship to turn a profit.

When Dave and Jean met as teenagers working as wranglers in Estes Park, their common dream in life was to run cattle.

""Oh, OK, nice,"" Dave said, recalling it. ""Someday we're gonna have a ranch, and someday we're gonna have some cattle.""

They got married, had kids, had jobs, and the ranch dream kind of fell by the wayside. ""So then when we were getting kind of old, we decided we needed to get out of the city and buy our dream,"" Jean said.

As they both came from the Front Range with no ranching experience, they had to learn their new livelihood from scratch.

""I mean, we're not perfect. We've made mistakes,"" Dave said, including a big one the first year they were on the ranch. Following accepted practices, they calved in February. But it gets so cold at the ranch in southern Park County, that when the cows calved on Tarryall Creek some newborns froze to the ice.

The newbie ranchers brought the cows down there, thinking they'd fare better out of the incessant winter wind. Another rancher suggested they calve in May, when the grass is green and the newborns can take their time getting up and moving around. They followed his advice, shifting their breeding program around, and ever since, the calves have thrived. ""Now if we lose a calf, it's because it was breech or had other problems,"" Dave said.

They ""listened to their gut"" when they saw their cattle grazing on a hillside with good forage but without water. Dave built a solar-powered watering system consisting of five ""drinkers"" in the meadow, which spread the cattle out.

Through trial and error, learning from others and trusting their instincts, they built the ranch they had dreamed of when they were teens wrangling horses in Estes Park. And because their sole income isn't from raising cattle, they have some extra flexibility to implement their conservation methods.

Dave said in ""A Sand County Almanac,"" Leopold recognized ""that private landowners have the majority of land and if conservation is going to happen it's going to take landowners. With pressures coming on private landowners whether it be from people opposed to grazing, fences or agricultural water use, we have to think of ways to coexist with what we have here. How do we know we're doing a good job in terms of our land management practices? According to Wendell Berry and even Leopold, it's measuring what we're doing with what was here before we got here.""

Which brings us back to the elk that ""when Mother Nature was in charge, had free movement,"" Dave said.

Dave thinks ranchers could increase their commercial value by doing things in the land ethic, like helping migrating elk from becoming coyote food in fences.

The elk were here long before the people who put up the wire, he reasons. But most ranchers aren't particularly fond of them. ""Why? Because they eat your grass and your grass is your livelihood,"" he said. ""The more grass that's eaten by something other than your cows, the less your animals eat. I understand that. I get that.""

But he lets elk from the Kenosha Pass herd -- which Colorado Parks and Wildlife numbers between 2,300 and 2,500 -- forage on his property. And in the last five years, he's come upon at least two live elk and several dead ones with their heads tangled in barbed wire.

When Dave recently came upon a live one, he had three choices: turn around and ignore it; shoot it and put it out of its misery (with CPW's permission); or try to cut it free.

""The elk was still standing,"" he said. ""It still had plenty of energy and life left in it."" He cut it free because he felt he could do it efficiently. ""I went in as quickly as I could and cut the wire. The elk jumped away from me and took off in the direction the rest of the herd had gone."" If it was damaged enough it might still have become coyote food, but Dave said if he'd left it to die, he wouldn't have been able to get the image out of his mind.

Other landowners, like Eagle Rock's last one, hate elk on their property so much they've hazed them with propane cannons and shotguns, Dave said. Now he's helping elk by installing lay-down fencing. Or, installing isn't the right word. Anyone with a barbed wire fence can create lay-down fencing by simply lifting the fence posts out of the ground and laying the barbed wire sections on the ground.

""It's very basic but very effective,"" Dave said. And the elk's legs don't get tangled up in it.

Fencing currently is the biggest impediment to wildlife in Colorado as ranches are subdivided and more fences go in, said Mark Lamb, CPW manager for Dave's area. Which makes wildlife-friendly fencing critically important.

""Dave's one of those guys that kind of thinks out of the box,"" Lamb said. ""He also cares about wildlife, which from our standpoint is also wonderful. So it's a really nice mix of the two.""

With fencing, ""it all comes down to the operator,"" Lamb added. ""So if you have somebody who's willing to take the time to lay a fence down, that is phenomenal. So kudos to Dave for coming to us and going, 'What do you think about this?'""

Now, letting elk range on his property might help him improve his ranch while offsetting costs. Last summer, he entered discussions with the conservation-focused Property and Environment Research Center that works to incentivize landowners to protect wildlife.

PERC recognizes that certain wildlife species on private lands can cost landowners money through forage loss, fence damage and disease transmission, causing them to ""view wildlife as a liability to be avoided instead of an asset to be protected.""

But they've had success pairing landowners with conservation organizations to incentivize wildlife protection. Travis Brammer, PERC's director of conservation, says ranchers are ""essential in providing critical habitat to elk,"" and yet ""they bear the brunt of incurring costs.""

Through PERC's conservation innovation lab landowners are being paid to do things like install virtual fencing to make it easier for elk to pass through their property, rotate cows within grazing allotments to minimize grizzly bear depredation, and an elk occupancy agreement that pays ranchers for letting elk forage on their property.

Brammer said Dave reached out to him last summer and that they're working on a program that will be tailored specifically to Eagle Rock Ranch. Specifics are still being ironed out, including funding.

But if, and likely when, an elk occupancy agreement is established, Brammer says it will be the first of its kind in Colorado, and could help other ranchers financially.

That could be good, as the Farm Bill, stalled in Congress until the end of September, receives heated debate in both the house and senate over crucial funding for conservation agriculture.

Here is where this story gets political.

Some say the term ""conservation ranching"" is problematic because of its association with ""climate smart"" ranching, a Biden administration policy.

Yet the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, awarded an additional $20 billion for existing conservation programs conservation agriculture in 2022, is enhancing existing programs that have long enabled producers to keep ranching through lean years and in some cases save their ranches, preserving vital American landscapes.

Hanna, who emphasized she was representing herself as a producer and not in her role as director of the Central Grasslands Roadmap initiative, is one of those Farm Bill beneficiaries. On her ranch in El Paso County, she says, she has used Farm Bill money in many ways. ""I've done several of the climate smart practices over the last several years. I added a significant amount of cross fencing, which changed my ability to graze on my family's ranch. I installed a lot of water pipeline, which was intended to distribute grazing.""

In the early 1990s, Hanna's father was doing a similar grazing rotation to hers, but at the time, the model for watering was a hub-and-spoke system, she said. It brought cattle to a center point to graze. That created a lot of localized impact. One of the best ways to protect soil health on a ranch is by distributing grazing cattle across it.

Farm Bill money allowed Hanna to add 17 watering facilities across her ranch, which she says means she can water at the end of two paddocks, spreading out the cattle.

It also helped her as a woman, she said.

""We talk all the time about resilience, and I think a lot of the power of these programs is that they create resilience in the human dimension. Like, I'm 5'5, and I feel quite strong, but I can't lug tarps around in the same way my male counterparts can or once did. So this gated pipe (she installed with Farm Bill money) created water efficiency, but it also means that I can pretty easily check water in the morning, move water by myself, close gates, open gates.""

Joe Hack, spokesperson for the Invest in Our Land campaign, which ""elevates farmers' voices"" to ""safeguard the future of U.S. farms,"" said conservation programs have existed through the Department of Agriculture for years, so incentivizing conservation is not necessarily something new. ""But it is wildly important, and the programs are wildly popular, and they're oversubscribed,"" he said. ""Just for example, in 2022, 73% of applicants to these conservation programs were denied because there was not enough funding for them to participate in the program.""

There are no better stewards of the land than farmers and ranchers, Hack said. ""They don't just live on the land, their livelihood is dependent upon it. So what these programs do is allow for improvements to soil health, dealing with clean water, and allow farmers and ranchers to be able to focus on productivity."" They also ensure family farms or ranches can remain so for years.

But Hack said Invest in Our Land believes the Farm Bill could be in trouble, based on comments made by Glenn ""GT"" Thompson, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Hack said Thompson has mentioned reallocating funds for these programs, something that could be detrimental to producers who need it to keep their farms and ranches alive.

""These conservation programs have proven to be effective for producers who are planning and preparing for economic uncertainty and changes in the environment,"" he said. ""Conservation has never been a partisan issue. Republicans and democrats have long benefitted from these programs and the fact that they are so oversubscribed points not just to their success but to a real demand that congress can and should meet.""

""A lot of people are doing conservation work,"" added Hanna, whose story is one featured in the Invest in Our Land campaign. ""There's a demand to put this work on the ground.""

Hack said the Farm Bill ""is critical not just for the success economically of these ranches, but also just the long-term environmental health of the land that they're working. I guess the frustrating part is there's nothing not to like about these programs.""

If the Farm Bill loses conservation funding in November, Dave Gottenborg's agrarian dream might start to sound pretty attractive.

""Elk rent"" could be a viable revenue stream, for instance.

""It's not like I'm gonna be able to retire on it or anything, but it will help construct some fences and, more importantly, I think, set a precedent for my neighbors,"" he said.

They'll see it as a way to ""maybe help pay for fences that get tore up every year. And you know, the elk are coming through here anyways,"" he added. ""So now we can get paid to have these wildlife friendly fences and this will enable better elk movement up and down the valley.""

He also believes times are changing in the ranching business, with the trend being ""obviously fewer cattle, not more,"" on private and public land. ""I'm not saying the trend is good or bad. But my range conservation officer and the Forest Service, they see, at some point, grazing cattle can't go on independently. Recreation pressures are coming and when push comes to shove, there's more of them than there are ranchers.""

The antidote, he thinks, is developing other income streams. At Eagle Rock, he'd like a quarter or a third of the income to come from cattle and the rest from agricultural tourism, ""from ecotours and education and that sort of thing.""

It might be hard for other ranchers to imagine following the Gottenborgs' way, because their ranch is 500 acres versus 3,000, say, or they don't have a creek brimming with trout running through it. Not everyone has a deal with The Broadmoor, in Colorado Springs, paying them to let people fly-fish on that creek, or a daughter who's a mastermind at marketing the beef tenderloins they sell at their mercantile in Fairplay. And hardly anyone has a cushion of money to fall back on if push comes to shove.

""I do worry about fellow ranchers that don't have maybe some of the natural resource attributes we have,"" Dave said. ""But I think we can help develop a way where other ranchers can do the same kind of thing we do. That trend is going to be good for the urban-rural divide, or breach, by exposing people to our perspective and us to theirs. There's always going to be an opportunity for exchange of ideas and culture.""

""Ranchers are essentially land stewards whether they realize it or not,"" he added. ""As the saying goes, 'you take care of the land, the land takes care of you.' Yet nobody -- besides ranchers, essentially -- realizes this fact. If we highlight it -- and even go so far as to showcase it, i.e., make it the focal point of the enterprise -- I think in today's world, one can then perhaps monetize it.""",coloradosun.com,news,The Colorado Sun,Tracy Ross,-0.04313725490196074,448967511,1,https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/eagle-rock-ranch-10-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,

The new spring menu, which launched on Thursday, March 21, builds upon the cafe's well-established niche.

Boston Tea Party (BTP), on High Street, is housed in a Grade-I listed building dating back to the early 1300s which the likes of William Shakespeare stayed in.

It is truly a sight to behold, especially upstairs, and I would encourage you to check it out because of this alone. The fact this cafe serves tasty food is a bonus!

General manager Jo Jo Grainger, 48, was keen to tell me that the smoked salmon hash (£12.95) was immediately a 'fan favourite', with the cafe selling eight on the day it launched.

This pescatarian cold dish beautifully layers flaked smoked salmon, avocado and charred corn on a crispy potato bed. A drizzle of sweet chilli and lime packs a flavourful punch.

BTP's vegetarian quesadilla (£11) has returned and it's better than ever, so Jo Jo tells me.

A careful blend of spicy fried black beans and melted cheese has been stuffed into four toasted tortilla wraps which are coated in chipotle butter.

Avocado, soured cream and Pico de Gallo, which is a salsa with tomato, red onion, garlic, coriander and lime, decorate the other side of the plate and proved a brilliant accompaniment.

Sustainability is a key consideration for the dishes, Jo Jo said, which explains why avocado is used across several of them.

BTP also doesn't serve one-use coffee cups and encourages customers to either bring their own or borrow a £3.50 Ecoffee Cup.

Back to the food and I have never ordered a salad when eating out before but BTP's final new spring addition left me questioning why.

The new house salad (£9.45) combines vintage cheddar, soft-boiled egg, Caesar-style dressing, lettuce, baby leaf spinach and sourdough croutons.

It was fantastic. Since the dressing doesn't use anchovies, the chef can easily make it vegan by swapping egg and cheese for avocado, should you wish. For meat lovers, it's simple enough to sprinkle a bit of bacon on top.

This dish can also be served as a side salad replacement for fries which usually come with the toasties and burgers.

Finally, Jo Jo presented the cafe's most popular dish, the 'Boss Breakfast' (£14.75).

This was pretty mega and I think you'd be hard pressed to find a cafe serving a better potato hash than BTP.

They look the part and have an incredibly satisfying crunch and taste. Two are served as part of the signature breakfast and they were by far my favourite part.

Something unique, in my experience, to this dish is the chunk of 'hog's pudding' which I was informed is essentially a pre-cooked herby piece of sausage, almost like a ham.

Head chef Devon Potter told me that the meat comes from Hunt's, a family butcher in Bristol, Hobbs House supply the bread and the eggs are free range.

My only criticism of this breakfast was the bacon, which lacked my desired level of crispiness. Still, I think you're getting good value for your money here.

While this may lead some investors to come off the gas, the sharpers among them see it as an opportunity to unearth the gems hidden among them.

Let's take a closer look at two established players, THORChain (RUNE) and VeChain (VET), before diving into the true hidden gem: DeeStream (DST).

One of the standouts so far this year is THORChain (RUNE). Its performance over the past month has exceeded expectations, as it has gained 56%. Attitude towards THORChain (RUNE) is bullish; some experts believe it will move to $14.06 before the end of the year. On the other hand, THORChain (RUNE) is currently trading at a healthy $7.70 trading price. Because there is still some scope for further growth, however, the degree of affordability may vary.

VeChain (VET) has also shown promise, recently surging over 60% to reach a new yearly high. This bullish trend stemmed from optimism surrounding its robust infrastructure, network expansion and growing institutional interest. However, the recent market correction pushed the price of VeChain (VET) down to $0.039. While the rollout of the VeBetterDAO platform signifies a positive step towards community engagement, the current price of VeChain (VET) suggests a potentially slower growth trajectory.

Now, let's shift gears and talk about a project with the potential for truly explosive growth: DST (DeeStream). DeeStream (DST) introduces a fresh and systematically designed live streaming system that works in a decentralized mode and delivers power to both content creators and viewers, respectively. DeeStream (DST) - being the global pioneer of the decentralized streaming platform, is in the best position to capture the fast-expanding live (projected to reach over $247 billion by 2027) streaming market.

Unlike traditional platforms that restrict creators, DeeStream (DST) offers instant payouts, lower fees and governance rights, fostering a thriving creator ecosystem. The DeeStream (DST) presale presents a unique opportunity to invest at a low price of just $0.055. Additionally, with team tokens locked for 1,000 days and liquidity locked for life, DeeStream (DST) prioritizes investor security.

While established coins like THORChain (RUNE) and VeChain (VET) offer potential for continued growth, their explosive potential may be limited. DeeStream (DST), on the other hand, stands out as a revolutionary project poised for massive disruption. Through its decentralized approach, dedication to the creators and presale offering, DeeStream (DST) presents a promising choice for investors looking for 100X returns. The market correction could have left a ditch, but what is hidden now in this ditch is a gem bound to be discovered.

At 9:04 p.m. ET, the Laval Rocket tweeted out that David Reinbacher, making his AHL debut, had tied the score in a crucial game against the Belleville Senators late in the third period. The video came a bit later, but it was well worth the wait.

And then, at 9:27 p.m. ET, the Rocket indicated that Logan Mailloux had scored the winner in overtime, establishing a new franchise record for rookie defencemen with his 14th goal of the season.

There it was, the Montreal Canadiens' future on defence playing out in real time, in incredibly quick succession. With Hutson likely to turn pro as soon as his season ends at BU, Reinbacher having just arrived and Mailloux completing his rookie season in Laval, that future is looking more and more imminent. There is also Adam Engström, a third-round pick in 2022 whom the Canadiens would like to sign once his playoff run with Rögle in the SHL comes to an end. Justin Barron is also playing on the right side in Laval right now with Reinbacher and Mailloux, three first-round picks preparing themselves for regular NHL duty.

That's five young defencemen in the Canadiens' pipeline with legitimate NHL aspirations. Add that to the seven defencemen currently on the team -- four of whom are 23 or younger -- and you have a serious logjam at the position.

When general manager Kent Hughes was asked at the trade deadline whether there was any possibility of moving out a young defenceman to make room at the position, he didn't exactly deny that might need to happen at some point.

""We're not in a rush because that's not the type of trade that happens at the trade deadline,"" Hughes said. ""It could happen at the draft or in the offseason.""

The Canadiens were off on deadline day (March 8). Jordan Harris wasn't overly concerned something would happen that day, but some people close to him were.

""I had my uncle texting me if I was going to get traded,"" Harris said Wednesday in Vancouver. ""It obviously crosses your mind. We're aware of what goes on around here. But I wouldn't say I'm scared or nervous to be traded. If it happens, it happens. Hopefully, it doesn't. I want to be in Montreal as long as I can be. But it's part of it. You see Jakey Allen (was) traded at the deadline, and it's sad. He's part of the team and is a big part of our group and was a great leader.""

Jake Allen was traded to the New Jersey Devils because there were three goalies on the roster and only two goalies can dress in any given game. Something had to give, and Allen knew it all season. When Harris says, ""We're aware of what goes on around here,"" that's what he means. Something will also have to give on defence, and this offseason seems like the time to do it.

Mike Matheson didn't even let the question finish before supplying the answer. The question was about all the young defencemen in the organization and how training camp in the fall will be ...

""Wild,"" Matheson said, smiling.

Below is a list of defencemen who could reasonably consider themselves a candidate to make the team next season, along with their ages as of Oct. 1, 2024.

With five righties and Engström, a left shot accustomed to playing on the right side, there are enough defencemen with a relatively even distribution of handedness to potentially fill out a top six in Montreal and Laval. Of course, it doesn't work that way. There will be an AHL veteran or two in Laval, and though there are six waiver-exempt defencemen on that list, the organization will not want all of them playing in Laval.

Of the seven defencemen currently on the Canadiens' active roster, only one -- Arber Xhekaj -- is not under contract next season, and Barron becomes a restricted free agent July 1. Barron will need waivers to be sent to Laval as of next season, adding pressure to his situation.

Waiver exemptions will start expiring for more and more players on this list as time passes, creating a need to use some of them to address holes elsewhere in the organization. And though ideally you would want to allow this situation to play out a bit to give yourself the most evaluation time possible to make sure you keep the right ones, the reality is players who are still waiver-exempt and have shown an ability to play in the NHL have a lot of trade value as cost-controlled, young assets any organization would want more of.

And the Canadiens have too many, which makes this offseason a prime time to flip some for help at forward.

Jayden Struble knew this was the landscape when he signed with the Canadiens last spring. He could have decided to wait and become an unrestricted free agent in August, allowing him to sign with a team with less depth at the position. But his previous relationship with Hughes and director of hockey development Adam Nicholas pushed him to sign with the team that drafted him in the second round in 2019, even though it wasn't the same administration.

""Obviously, there's a lot of competition. I knew that when I signed here that there was going to be a ton of competition,"" Struble said. ""It doesn't change too much. I did what I could this year to show what I'm about, and I think the rest will kind of just come. There's not much you can do other than put your best foot forward.""

Harris had the same option to become a free agent as Struble, his collegiate teammate, a year earlier and also chose to enter this crowded blue-line landscape. That overcrowding is one of the reasons his name started popping up in trade rumours -- rumours his uncle saw floating around.

""At the end of the day, it's the NHL, right? Any team and in any organization, there's going to be a lot of good players around you,"" Harris said. ""You just have to trust in what you can do, and you never know how it's going to play out. If I'm playing my best hockey, it's at a pretty high level, and I trust in that, and I trust that I'm going to continue to grow as a player. So you just have to believe in yourself and hope that things work out, and I know the infrastructure around me is really, really solid.""

One way of determining how the Canadiens might act in the future is to look at how they've acted in the past. At the 2022 NHL Draft in Montreal, they traded Alexander Romanov to the New York Islanders for a first-round pick they then used to acquire Kirby Dach from the Chicago Blackhawks.

Guhle wasn't at the draft, but he was watching it, and that trade sent him a message.

""I had talked to Kirby maybe a month or two before, and he said there was a chance that he could get traded here, that there were talks about it,"" Guhle said. ""As soon as I heard that there was a trade with Chicago, Montreal and New York, I was like, 'OK, well, Kirby is probably coming, then.' Obviously, Romy was leaving.

""But yeah, as soon as I saw that, I knew that there was a spot open on D, and I just wanted to do everything I could to take that spot.""

A big reason the Canadiens felt comfortable trading Romanov was that they had Guhle sitting there. And though Guhle doesn't quite see it that way, that trade motivated him that offseason to come to camp ready to win an NHL job, which is exactly what he did.

""I wanted it to be me that was going to take over that spot. I didn't think it was going to be me, but I knew they had some sort of plan for someone to fill in that spot,"" Guhle said. ""That was just me wanting to take that spot and be that guy.""

There is the possibility of a similar situation playing out this offseason. The day after the trade deadline, when David Savard was asked about still being in Montreal, just the way he wanted, he said he was happy but that we'd see what happens this offseason. If Savard were to be traded this summer, the same feeling Guhle had in 2022 could easily be felt by Barron, Mailloux and Reinbacher.

""Every organization has a bunch of guys fighting for spots,"" Matheson said. ""That's the nature of being in the best league in the world. I think it's exciting for the team to continue building to the goal that we want to get to. But on a personal level, if you think you'll ever be anywhere where your job is safe for years to come, you're only doing yourself a disservice.""

For now, there is no point for any of the current NHL players to be overly worried about it. The season is not over yet, after all. But it will be soon, and there is a good chance that will open the door to a major reassessment of what is easily the Canadiens' biggest area of strength this summer.

The team's future defence corps will be at the heart of any success this organization might have, but it is also the asset pool from which it can address the organization's weakness up front.

Every organization hopes to create a situation where there is internal competition, and the Canadiens have that now in a big way.

""It's the NHL -- everyone wants to get here,"" Xhekaj said. ""So I'm competing with everyone else in the league, everyone else coming into the league and your teammates every day. I think that kind of brings your team up to a whole new level when you're competing with them. I think it's good, but we're all really good with each other.

""It's just play your game and be happy for the other guy but, obviously, still chase him and beat him, I guess, in a way.""",theathletic.com,news,The Athletic,Arpon Basu,0.1764705882352942,448967284,1,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/03/23195621/Jordan-Harris-and-Jayden-Struble-scaled-e1711243338959.jpg,eng-9417319

The DeeStream (DST) ongoing presale is gaining attention from Litecoin (LTC) and Aptos (APT) investors, thanks to its strong growth potential. This strong interest is unsurprising as its value has soared in its ongoing presale.

DeeStream is the first decentralized streaming platform. Individuals around the world are becoming more interested in this fairer, faster and more transparent streaming platform. As we all know, investing in such promising projects early on may result in major gains in the future if the project succeeds. Thus, many Litecoin and Aptos investors are joining the DeeStream presale.

Recently, Litecoin has been going up and down on the price charts. According to CoinMarketCap data, the Litecoin price rose from $70 to $85 last month. Its market cap grew from $5.21B to $6.33B during that time. However, Litecoin dropped 12% in the past week from $96 to $85.

When looking at the Litecoin technical analysis, things look more bullish. In other words, Litecoin is now trading above its 50 and 100-day EMAs while boasting 25 green technical indicators. Due to all these reasons, market analysts have made a bullish Litecoin price prediction. They forecast a rise to $107 within Q2 of 2024.

Meanwhile, Aptos has been riding a bullish wave. The Aptos price surged from $9.3 to $15.9 in the past 30 days a 73% growth. Its market cap increased from $3.62B to $6B in that period. Additionally, Aptos experienced 17/30 (57%) green trading days during that time.

The technical analysis for Aptos also shows a bullish trend. For instance, 26 technical indicators are now showing buy signals for Aptos. Additionally, Aptos trades above its 21 and 50-day EMAs. When making their price predictions, experts in the crypto field take note of all these factors. Therefore, they predict Aptos will hit $19.27 before Q2 of 2024 ends.

The DeeStream presale has been gaining traction amid this market volatility. This revolutionary project aims to redefine the streaming market, projected to reach $247 Billion by 2027. Streaming platforms impose high fees, unfair bans and lengthy payout checks. But, DeeStream will stand out from its rivals as it introduces the first-ever decentralized streaming platform.

With blockchain technology in its corner, DeeStream will introduce immediate withdrawals/deposits and exceptionally low fees. Additionally, users are free to talk about anything and express their opinions. The DeeStream token is now available for just $0.055 in Stage 2 of its presale. Experts predict further exponential growth for the project if it gets listed on exchanges in 2024.",crypto.news,news,crypto.news,,0.3019607843137255,448967151,1,https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2024/03/crypto-news-podacst-radio-option01.webp,eng-9413930

Louise suffers from multiple sclerosis and from 1996 she has lived in the same two-bedroom flat in north London which has not been renovated or refurbished since.

But last year her landlord told her the rent of her property would soon be increasing by 25 per cent, a startling £325 extra a month. She is one of millions of Britons in the grip of a ""cost of renting"" crisis as prices skyrocket, no-fault evictions surge, and properties across the country are mouldy, damp and cold.

The average rent in the UK is now £1,238, which is £102 higher than 12 months ago after a record rise of 9 per cent.

She said: ""I'm on fixed income, there is nothing I can do, I don't work due to my health issues, so it's just more stress and depression. And stress makes my multiple sclerosis worse, and has left me practically housebound. I can't actually do anything, I haven't got any money to do anything...I don't know where I am going to get the money from.""

The 58-year-old was diagnosed with MS in 2012 and worked for a charity for years, before her ill health forced her to stop shortly after the pandemic ended, leaving her with a limited budget.

She said: ""I was hoping I would be able to live here until I retired but now I'm already looking to move away from London back to where my parents are in Wales, where I have friends and family for support, because having MS means you have to rely more on the people around you.""

The north Londoner said the situation in the capital has got worse and her neighbours have also had ""substantial"" rent increases.

Startling data released this week showed rental costs have increased at the fastest rate on record as tenants struggle to afford inflation-busting monthly outlays.

Office for National Statistics data shows London had the highest rent inflation, at 10.6 per cent, way above inflation, which is running at 3.4 per cent.

Rapidly escalating costs are just one element of the UK's dysfunctional housing market. The dilapidated state of homes in the UK has been put into sharp focus ever since the death of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old who died after breathing in black mould while living in a housing association property.

In England, no-fault evictions, which occur when people who rent their homes can be removed without landlords having to provide a reason under a Section 21 notice, surged by almost 50 per cent last year, compared with 2022.

Campaigners say the private rental market is at ""boiling point"" and that successive governments' failure to build affordable homes has left people fighting for ""overpriced and often shoddy rentals"".

Eilidh Keay, 26, who has lived in Edinburgh for the last years, had to leave her home as the landlord wanted to sell the property, and was forced to pay out an additional £150 per month for rent in a new place.

In Scotland there is a rent cap, which limits the amount a landlord can increase the rent, since the landlord sold up, she had to find another property in a city with high private rental costs.

The public affairs worker said: ""The prices of things are quite stark. Edinburgh has always been expensive and I don't think that's going to change, but the escalation in prices in the last few years has been rapid.

""You used to be able to get a one-bed [flat] in Edinburgh on a lower salary, but now it's completely unreasonable and it costs £1000 a month. Flatsharing is also becoming really expensive, I know friends who are moving from the centre to further out just due to the cost.""

She added that high rents and the cost of living crisis have altered aspects of her life, and she tends to socialise with her friends at home to cut down on costs, rather than go to the pub.

The 26-year-old said: ""That's what I think is one of the things that's so bad about these extreme rents everyone is facing across the country, as it takes money out of the economy. All this money is just going into people's buy-to-let mortgages and pensions, and this is in part why the High Street is suffering because nobody has any disposable income anymore, it's all been absorbed by the wealthy.

She said any further increases in rent could force her out of the capital and says she favours rent controls and would like the government to address the poor quality of private rented stock.

A report last year from think-tank the Resolution Foundation said up to 2.6 million people aged 18-34 were living in poor-quality housing. This was defined as homes that did not have fully working plumbing, or where damp or mould were present.

Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Private renting has reached boiling point. Decades of failure to build genuinely affordable social homes have left many people with no choice but to put up and shut up in private renting, where competition for overpriced and often shoddy rentals is fierce.

""Landlords can hike up the rent safe in the knowledge that if their tenant can't pay, they can serve them a no-fault eviction notice and get someone else in who can.

""With only two months to find another place after a no fault eviction, too many people are left scrambling to find somewhere affordable to live and in some cases, being pushed into homelessness.

""To help struggling families keep hold of their homes, the government must keep its promise to renters and pass a watertight Renters (Reform) Bill, without caveats or loopholes, to ban no-fault evictions. However, the only lasting solution to the housing emergency is to invest in truly affordable social homes with rents tied to local incomes.""

Aditi Jehangir, secretary of Living Rent, said: ""Rent in Scotland is completely unaffordable and our homes are falling apart at the seams. The government's response has been to introduce a complicated, unworkable, rent adjudication system that puts the onus on tenants to hold their landlords to account.

""The average tenant already spends at least a third of their income on rent. Tenants should not be forced to choose between remaining in the communities they love or being able to afford to live.

""The temporary and partial nature of the rent cap has underscored the need for more robust, long-term solutions, that limit rents between tenancies, not a return to the free market.""",independent.co.uk,news,The Independent,,-0.3647058823529412,448967143,1,https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/20/16/iStock-506198338.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9412140

Speaking at the event, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said STI sectors are the key foundation for the development of the digital economy and society.

""This event will inspire people to love science, technology and innovation,"" he said. ""STI sectors play a crucial role in supporting the government's policies towards achieving Cambodia's visions of becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income nation by 2050.""

Regarding the free trade agreements (FTAs) that Cambodia has with China, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the prime minister said the development of STI would help the kingdom reap the maximum benefits from these FTAs, he added.

Under the theme of ""Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Go STI,"" the event, organized by the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, was held at the Diamond Island Convention and Exhibition Center in Phnom Penh.

Hem Vanndy, minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, said the STI day would help further boost Cambodia's economic growth and foster innovation.

""It will help accelerate the greater adoption of STI among SMEs,"" he said.

China is pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li said at the China Development Forum in Beijing.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy measures, Li added. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to diffuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited one trillion yuan (S$190 billion) in previously announced ultra long special treasury bonds. These will spur investment and stabilise economic growth, he said.

Also on Sunday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that China needs to ""reinvent itself"" with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity. ""China faces a fork in the road - rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" she said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.

Officials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence that China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5 per cent this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area that Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed ""new productive forces"".

But those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centred policy mix could add US$3.5 trillion to China's economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.

To do that China would need to take ""decisive"" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.

""A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,"" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. ""Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.""

Other economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message that China is open for business.

Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20 per cent in the first two months of the year, data released on Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to ""de-risk"" supply chains and operations away from China.

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8 per cent, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an ""outstanding"" meeting with Premier Li.

""I think China is really opening up,"" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals such as aluminium and cobalt.

Stephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.

The two-day forum is being held at a time when the US$18 trillion economy is facing multiple headwinds, from a property crisis, local government debt woes, and industrial overcapacity to deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum traditionally serves as an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to meet and discuss foreign investment.

The Shiba Inu community is buoyed as Shibarium, the meme coin's Layer 2 solution, reaches a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $3.38 million, signaling growing investor confidence amidst a notable SHIB price rally. This uptick in TVL, spurred by the launch of new tokens and features, marks a significant momentum shift for the cryptocurrency.

Shibarium's TVL Soars with New DAMN Token Launch, Boosting Shiba Inu's Market Presence

In a recent report by CoinGape, Shiba Inu, a dog-based meme cryptocurrency, recently echoed a sense of activity in the cryptocurrency landscape. With its price rising while writing and Shiba Inu L2 Shibarium reaching new heights, the meme coin has made waves in today's broader cryptocurrency market.

This jump drew considerable investor attention following recent price corrections in Shiba Inu. Meanwhile, the Shibarium TVL's meteoric rise appears to be primarily due to WoofSwap's newly launched DAMN token.

Shibarium's TVL Hits $3.38 Million, Propelling SHIB's Tokenomics with New Token Launches

According to DeFi Llama's insights, Shibarium's TVL reached $3.38 million today, marking a significant milestone for the Shiba crypto community. Following the introduction of a slew of new features to Shibarium, including the launch of KNINE and DAMN tokens, the sudden increase in the Shiba Inu L2's TVL demonstrated the community's successful efforts to boost SHIB's tokenomics

The DAMN token was introduced to Shibarium by WoofSwap, a DEX based on the L2. Shiba Inu's partnership with K9 Finance created the KNINE token, a liquid staking derivatives token.

Additionally, in conjunction with the announcement of the DAMN token, LUCIE, Shiba Inu's marketing lead, recently highlighted critical assistance the meme coin's ecosystem received from WoofSwap. Lucie emphasized that WoofSwap's significant support in increasing Shibarium transactions and Shib burn is crucial for the meme coin's ecosystem.

Meanwhile, as previously stated, the rise in TVL demonstrated a significant increase in the amount of cryptocurrency assets locked within the Shibarium network. This shows the growing investor interest and participation in Shibarium's decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and applications.

Furthermore, SHIB has mirrored this surge in investor interest, with an upward trend as of press time.

According to a source, the Shiba Inu coin has increased 3.64% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $0.00002762. This jump has sparked significant optimism following a massive drop in recent days.

This price increase is driven by a remarkable 250% surge in the SHIB burn rate over the last 24 hours.

As the conversation began, Worthington made reference to one of Brundle's most awkward grid walk exchanges. ""I'm not going to Cara Delevingne you this time,"" he quipped to the Sky Sports commentator and former racer.

Worthington was referring to Delevingne's snub to Brundle on the grid at last year's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It's fair to say Brundle's record of interviewing celebrities ahead of races is mixed. While some are more than happy to chat, others have been downright rude towards him.

Delevingne fell into the latter category. As Brundle approached, he was bluntly told by security that she ""doesn't want to talk"". The legendary broadcaster approached anyway, only for Delevingne to shake her head.

What did you think of Brundle's chat with Sam Worthington? Tell us in the comments section below

Brundle told the actress: ""The deal is everybody has to speak on the grid"", before facing more rejection as she claimed she ""can't hear anything"". The awkward exchange saw the model come in for heavy criticism on social media.

His chat with hoodie-wearing Worthington wasn't exactly straight-forward, with viewers branding the exchange ""awkward"". With the pair seemingly struggling to hear each other, Brundle managed to ask about his current work, with Worthington replying: ""Just working, doing more Avatars, it's good.""

Worthington said he was rooting for Red Bull, saying it was a ""long time since they'd won in Australia"" despite the fact Max Verstappen won the race 12 months ago.

The Diplomatic Bluebook for 2024 will also underscore that Tokyo ""cannot afford to waste even a moment"" to solve the long-standing issue of North Korea's past abductions of Japanese nationals as the victims' families continue to age, according to the draft obtained by Kyodo News.

""China has been continuing and intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force"" and ""military activities"" in waters surrounding Japan, including the South and East China seas, the draft paper said.

Such moves by China have put Japan in ""the most severe and complex"" security environment and should be addressed by collaborating with like-minded nations not only its close security ally the United States but also the Philippines, Australia and South Korea, the draft said.

With Beijing's territorial claims and expanding military activities in mind, Japan, the United States and the Philippines have been strengthening security collaboration in recent years.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to meet with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on April 11 in Washington, the first-ever trilateral summit for the countries. They are expected to agree on deeper cooperation.

In the draft police, Japan also urged China to immediately lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood products, which was introduced following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan's disaster-hit Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea that began in August, Kyodo news reported.

According to the United Nations, women have the highly specialized knowledge of forests from species diversity, management of resources, to conservation and restoration practices that are vital to sustainable development and food security.

In the Philippines, while the Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Plan (GEWE Plan) 2019-2025 exists, challenges related to gender disparities in the industry remain.

The Philippine Commission on Women reports that women in the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sectors constitute only about 25% of the workers and face marginalization in employment, pay, and resource access.

For its part, LivE shared insights on how local organizations can address these problems and give women the right avenue to excel in sustainability and conservation.

LivE emphasized the importance of training sessions addressing women's rights in forest management.

In one of its sessions that tackled challenges about health, domestic responsibilities, production roles, and social engagement and their link to environmental strains, 52-year-old Rita Wati, a native of Kerinci Seblat National Park and now chairperson of ""Women's Group for Environmental Care Maju Bersama"" emerged as a driving force behind conservation efforts.

Wati experienced skepticism from being a woman in a male-dominated field but still persevered and pushed for a proposal that allowed her organization to be involved in managing and conserving Indonesia's Kerinci Seblat National Park.

She inked a historic conservation partnership agreement with the national park, marking Maju Bersama group as the pioneering women's group managing a forest area in Indonesia.

The first of these papers investigates the economic linkages between agriculture and the wider economy in Sweden. We develop a method for disaggregating the agricultural sector in the Swedish input-output (IO) table. Output multipliers are generally higher for livestock sectors compared to crop production and range between 1.52 and 2.20 for the open model. In the second study we develop a method for overcoming the aggregation bias associated with aggregated IO tables. Aggregation bias can be as large as 5-6 percent for agricultural sectors in a Swedish region and can be dealt with using limited and more available data to construct a disaggregated IO shock. We demonstrate how such an approach can be used for modelling reforms to the CAP. This approach minimises bias without the time and money required to do a full disaggregation of agriculture. The third paper deal with non-survey IO regionalisation. We reveal that the foundations are weak for applying standard location quotients to tables of indirect allocation of imports, so called technological coefficients. We demonstrate the sensitivity in regional multiplier analysis from doing so, using six different regional IO tables. Even the location quotient that scale down national IO coefficients the most show on average 12 percent higher regional multipliers when national technological coefficients are adjusted, rather than national trade coefficients. The fourth paper investigates the scope of hybrid governance in relation to agri-environmental and rural development policies of the CAP. We combine a survey, a case study and a stakeholder discussion and show benefits in both process and outcome that could possibly be utilised to a larger extent in implementing and developing the policy. In the fifth and final study we investigated the role of agricultural policies, specifically the environmental and rural development policies of the CAP, in promoting sustainable rural development. 20 stakeholder interviews were performed to evaluate the possibilities for agriculture and current policies to fulfil this role. One result is that environmental programs support many aspects of rural development, for instance by making some types of diversification possible.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.09019607843137256,448965615,1,,

The Diplomatic Bluebook for 2024 will also underscore that Tokyo ""cannot afford to waste even a moment"" to solve the long-standing issue of North Korea's past abductions of Japanese nationals as the victims' families continue to age, according to the draft obtained by Kyodo News.

""China has been continuing and intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force"" and ""military activities"" in waters surrounding Japan, including the South and East China seas, the draft paper said.

Such moves by China have put Japan in ""the most severe and complex"" security environment and should be addressed by collaborating with like-minded nations not only its close security ally the United States but also the Philippines, Australia and South Korea, the draft said.

With Beijing's territorial claims and expanding military activities in mind, Japan, the United States and the Philippines have been strengthening security collaboration in recent years.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to meet with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on April 11 in Washington, the first-ever trilateral summit for the countries. They are expected to agree on deeper cooperation.

In the draft police, Japan also urged China to immediately lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood products, which was introduced following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan's disaster-hit Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea that began in August, Kyodo news reported.

he Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA) has emphasised the importance of conserving water resources in the face of scarcity of renewable sources by ensuring their optimal use and avoiding harmful practices that exacerbate water waste and depletion.

This is in line with the 'Mohamed bin Zayed Water Initiative', launched under the directives of President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to address the pressing global challenge of water scarcity.

This comes on the occasion of World Water Day, which is celebrated every year on 22nd March, and highlights initiatives aimed at achieving sustainability in the agricultural sector and preserving natural resources for future generations.

ADAFSA, in coordination with strategic partners, is working to implement several projects and initiatives to improve water efficiency in agriculture, mitigate the environmental impacts of water mismanagement, and manage water resources comprehensively. One of the key projects is the Treated Water Distribution Project, where ADAFSA has recently extended treated water to more than 1,600 farms in Al Khatam, Al Khaznah and Al Nahda areas, as part of an ambitious plan to expand the use of recycled water for irrigating farms in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in collaboration with its strategic partners, the Department of Energy - Abu Dhabi (DoE), the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), in addition to TAQA, Abu Dhabi and Al Ain Distribution Company, and Abu Dhabi Sustainable Water Solutions Company.

Abu Dhabi's plan to expand the use of recycled water in agriculture is in line with its overall sustainability goals, as recycled water is one of the important and necessary options to reduce pressure on groundwater resources and can be used in various development sectors, including agriculture, to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production and reduce the depletion of natural water resources.The Project is in line with the objectives of the UAE Water Security Strategy 2036 which aims to ensure the sustainability and continuity of securing water supplies for all residential, commercial, public, industrial and agricultural uses.

It is also consistent with Abu Dhabi's recycled water policy, which aims to maximise the use of recycled water, in addition to contributing to the rationalisation of groundwater use in agriculture and achieving integrated management and sustainable development of available water resources. This is because recycled water is one of the most important alternative and sustainable sources for use in agriculture, with the need to comply with international standards that ensure the safe use of recycled water and the safety of agricultural products produced by farms irrigated with this water.

ADAFSA is also implementing the Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. This plan is being developed in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and will result in a comprehensive development plan for the next ten years. The plan will identify the priority actions needed to transform the Emirate's agricultural sector into a more sustainable one from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

The project includes the development of decision support tools consisting of an innovative platform and interactive maps based on geographic information systems, analyses and mathematical models for planning and dividing agricultural areas based on their environmental, agricultural and social characteristics. It is based on a series of in-depth economic modelling and analytical studies and complementary studies aimed at increasing the efficiency of sustainable agricultural production in the emirate.

The Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi adopts the principle of regional planning for the emirate's farms. This involves identifying areas that are similar in terms of development potential and resources, and developing development procedures for them. The aim is to formulate a comprehensive plan that includes the adoption of climate-smart agriculture to ensure sustainable development in Abu Dhabi.

ADAFSA's water conservation programmes include the development of the Electronic Irrigation Calculator Project, launched in 2019 to provide farmers with a smart tool to accurately determine their water needs and optimise their consumption. The system will help farmers calculate the water needed for crops according to weather conditions in each region. It also provides farmers with updated information on irrigation needs for agricultural crops according to actual planting schedules, directly linked to and fed by ADAFSA's agricultural weather stations.

In addition, the project to measure the average water consumption on farms in the emirate: meters were installed to calculate the average water consumption on farms in order to identify gaps and implement appropriate solutions to conserve water in the agricultural sector in the emirate.ADAFSA's initiatives also include the Collective Irrigation Programme, which aims to manage the irrigation system through collective irrigation stations in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. This system currently covers some 6,300 farms spread across the emirate's agricultural areas. The system has helped farmers improve the quantity or quality of their water, with each farm receiving a specific amount of water based on its area and water source.

In addition, ADAFSA organises training and extension programmes to raise awareness among farm owners and workers about the importance of rationalising water use and best agricultural practices that contribute to the conservation of water resources. In 2023, 736 training courses and extension programmes were held, with 18,515 participants.

ADAFSA provides a dedicated mobile application for agricultural advice. The application includes guides on general irrigation guidelines and the appropriate irrigation system for each crop, as well as water requirements and irrigation scheduling. It also provides farmers with detailed information on best farming practices for different crops. The application has been used by 5,100 users to date.Additionally, ADAFSA is implementing several initiatives to conserve water and improve its efficiency, including the Abu Dhabi Good Agricultural Practices (AD GAP) programme for farms in the emirate. The programme applies best agricultural practices in general and water conservation in particular. In 2023, 1,530 farms will be certified.

ADAFSA has recently updated and issued a set of regulations and specifications for water-consuming cropland. The aim is to regulate practices in the agricultural sector in a way that serves the goals and aspirations of the Abu Dhabi government in strengthening the role of this vital sector. In addition, ADAFSA is strengthening the role of inspection and control to monitor violations and take the necessary action against them. The Authority emphasises its confidence in the awareness of farmers and their understanding of the importance of water conservation.

Moreover, ADAFSA consistently supports and advises farmers to maintain their irrigation networks regularly and to use modern irrigation systems tailored to the specific needs of each crop. They encourage farmers to irrigate at optimum times and to respect the water quotas set for each crop. In addition, ADAFSA promotes the use of advanced agricultural technologies that accurately determine the water needs of crops. They also encourage the adoption of efficient irrigation systems, such as hydroponic systems, which are known for their superior water efficiency. To date, some 89 farms have adopted hydroponic farming methods, demonstrating ADAFSA's commitment to promoting sustainable agricultural practices in Abu Dhabi. (ANI/WAM)

Shannon Grove's recent discussion on the escalating energy costs in California resonates deeply, especially for us in Kern County. Our region's substantial role in fueling the state's diverse energy mix is met with an unjust economic challenge: skyrocketing utility bills that eclipse both income growth and the cost of living. This situation underscores a glaring contradiction: our leadership in energy production contrasts sharply with the financial strain we endure.

The shift toward cleaner energy sources is indeed a noble goal. However, this transition necessitates policies that acknowledge and respect the economic variances across California's communities. It is unfair for the residents of Kern County, who play a crucial role in the state's energy sector, to face punitive costs. Our dedication to advancing energy solutions warrants fair policies that mitigate the economic burdens on those leading California's energy advancements.

The environment is the basis for human survival and includes indoor and outdoor environments. At present, outdoor air pollution is still one of the main risk factors for human health and has become a global environmental problem. In addition, people spend 90% of their lifetime in the indoor environment, which includes building indoor spaces, industrial plants, underground spaces, transportation, space station, etc., but indoor environmental problems (such as sick building syndrome, building-related diseases (respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer, etc.)) continue to emerge with no sign of stopping. Although scholars have conducted much related research, the impact of law, scientific understanding, control technology, construction means, and other aspects in the interactions between humans and indoor and outdoor environments still needs to be further explored. Such aspects can be summarized as follows: 1) Indoor environment creation, including the mechanism of environmental exposure to the human body, the improvement of human thermal comfort theory, human health monitoring, the transmission mechanism of respiratory infectious diseases, indoor air quality, intelligent regulation of indoor environment, etc.; 2) Outdoor environment controlling and improvement, including air pollution control, pollutant toxicity mechanism, urban outdoor space environment improvement, the impact mechanism of outdoor environment on indoor environment, etc.; 3) Energy conservation and emissions reduction, involving low-carbon and zero-carbon transformation of existing buildings, low-carbon/zero-carbon green buildings/communities, carbon emission measurement and management methods, deep utilization of low-grade heat, radiation refrigeration, etc.; 4) Smart cities and flexible environments, involving green low-carbon cities, high-performance green building, monitoring and improvement of building environment and urban air quality, etc.

""Uttar Pradesh being the most populous state (in the country) is a very important market for us. We have a massive user base of 16 million users for NARZO (brand) and it is increasing significantly, especially in UP. Our UP customers are very loyal. Their expectations from realme are very high.

""And, our consumers have made a 'real' bond with realme,"" Prateek Rai Chaudhary, General Manager realme India, told PTI.

Chaudhary was in Lucknow on Friday for the launch of realme NARZO 70 Pro 5G.

He said, ""We are expanding cautiously. We do not want to clutter the market with launching different products, and not giving them proper service. So that's why we are taking a very focused approach. We have 700 service centres across India in 532 cities, and we are available at 50,000-plus stores across India, and in UP as well since it is a very important market for us.""

On the latest product launch, Chaudhary said, ""We thought that it was required by the audience under the Rs 20,000 price segment. There are a lot of challenges that the users are facing, and we thought of addressing those issues. In terms of display, the brands that are selling the phone under Rs 20,000, are giving LCDs. So, we thought that we will give AMOLED...which has a high brightness.""

He added that the AMOLED screens are generally used in the Rs 20,000-25,000 price category, and, so ""we thought that we will revolutionise this.""

For what it's worth, we are so addicted to this technology nowadays. However, have you ever experienced or seen using drones for spraying crops in Auburn? Indeed, with the help of drones, a farmer can enhance production and efficiency for covering a wider range of crops. That means, with drones come efficiency and better farming options. But if this doesn't ring any bell, be our guest and read this guide to discover how drone spraying is making farming better, faster, and superior than ever!

How Drone Technology is Transforming Crop Spraying in Auburn?

Drones are there in so many applications that you might have imagined before. From advertising in the sky to crop spraying, they are called a new game changer for people across the world. However, when it comes to crops, the following are reasons drone technology is transforming crop spraying in Auburn!

Increased Efficiency

Drones are changing the way farmers in Auburn spray their crops. These flying machines can cover large areas quickly, much faster than traditional methods. This means farmers can spray more land in less time. Also, drones can fly close to the crops, which makes the spraying very accurate.

Speed Is There

Drones can cover large areas quickly. Studies show they can spray 4-6 hectares (about 10-15 acres) in just 20 minutes! That's much faster than tractors or manual spraying, saving farmers precious time.

Safety Improvements

Drones make crop spraying safer. Before, people had to use machines or airplanes, which could be risky. Now, with drones, there is no need for people to be near the chemicals. This is much safer for the workers.

Targeting practice:

Drones are equipped with GPS like a fancy sat nav, that tells them exactly where to go. This means they can target specific areas of a field, avoiding waste and ensuring even coverage. Less spray means less money spent on chemicals!

Tricky terrain, no problem:

Unlike tractors that get stuck easily, drones can fly over uneven ground, ditches, or around obstacles. This makes them perfect for farms with irregular fields, getting to those hard-to-reach spots.

Manpower saver:

Drones can do the spraying while farmers focus on other important tasks. This reduces the need for manual labor, which can be tiring and time-consuming. Plus, it keeps farmers away from potentially harmful chemicals.

Environmental Benefits

Drones are better for the environment. They target only the areas that need spraying, so they use less chemicals. This means fewer chemicals end up in the soil and water. It's a smarter way to look after the crops and the planet.

In short, drone spraying is like having a super-fast, super-accurate robot helper in your field. It saves time, saves money, and lets farmers work smarter, not harder!

Is Drone Spraying Good for Crops?

Yes, drone spraying can be good for crops. Drones can be used to apply pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals to crops more precisely than traditional methods like tractors or airplanes. This can help to reduce the amount of chemicals used, which can save money and protect the environment. In addition, drones can be used to spray crops in areas that are difficult to reach with tractors, such as hilly terrain or wet fields. However, there are also some downsides to drone spraying.

For example, drones can be expensive to purchase and operate, and they may not be effective in windy conditions. Overall, drone spraying can be a useful tool for farmers, but it is important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to use this technology. With these, you find out more about drones and how they help in the latest farming!

Frequently Asked Questions: What types of crops can benefit from drone spraying technology in Auburn?

In Auburn, drone technology has an effect on a wide range of crops including, but not limited to, corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton. The versatility of drones allows them to adapt to different types of terrain and crop heights, making them suitable for various agricultural needs.

Is drone technology for crop spraying regulated in Auburn?

Yes, the use of drones for agricultural purposes in Auburn is subject to regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and local guidelines. Operators must obtain the necessary certifications and adhere to safety and privacy laws to ensure responsible use of drone technology.

What training or certifications are necessary to operate agricultural drones in Auburn?

Operators must pass the FAA Part 107 exam to become certified drone pilots. Additionally, specialized training in agricultural drone operation, which covers topics such as crop scouting, data analysis, and pesticide application techniques, is highly recommended to maximize the benefits of drone technology in farming.

Last Words:

Without any doubt, Drone technology is super passing human traditional methods. It is because technology is helping farmers a great deal with lowered labor costs and more time-saving in spraying a large crop area. Therefore, if you haven't thought about the drone technique for spraying in Auburn, you should consider applying it now. We hope this guide will be useful to you by any means.

The viral infection was passed from a patient to a doctor, but the doctor's symptoms have improved, the NIID said earlier this week.

The doctor, a man in his 20s, attended to a patient in his 90s who had been diagnosed with SFTS after visiting the emergency room last April due to deteriorating health, the institute said.

The doctor performed various procedures on the patient who later died, including removing his catheter post-mortem, during which the doctor reportedly wore a face mask and gloves but no goggles.

Approximately nine days after the patient's death, the doctor developed symptoms of fever and headache, and was diagnosed with SFTS upon medical examination, it added.

Technological solutions to tag potentially harmful content and shifting the burden on developers and disseminators to justify the use of such content could also be designed, he said.

Penalty provisions can act as a deterrent to the development and dissemination of deepfakes and misinformation, a senior official of global think tank Cuts International said while calling for the deployment of technology interventions to check misuse of AI-generated content. CUTS International, Director, Research, Amol Kulkarni told PTI that internet users would require adequate opportunities to verify the genuineness of content and it becomes important during the election season while the role of credible fact-checkers and trusted flaggers becomes crucial.

He said that while the government advisory on March 15 removes permission requirements, it continues to rely on information disclosures to users for making the right choices on the Internet.

''Though transparency is good, information overload and 'pop-ups' across user journeys may reduce their quality of experience. There is a need to balance the information requirements, with other implementable technological and accountability solutions which can address the problem of deepfakes and misinformation,'' Kulkarni said.

After a controversy over a response of Google's AI platform to queries related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government on March 1 issued an advisory for social media and other platforms to label under-trial AI models and prevent hosting unlawful content.

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in the advisory issued to intermediaries and platforms warned of criminal action in case of non-compliance.

The previous advisory has asked the entities to seek approval from the government for deploying under trial or unreliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploy them only after labelling them of ''possible and inherent fallibility or unreliability of the output generated''.

The Ministry of Electronics and IT on March 15 issued a revised advisory on the use and rollout of AI-generated content.

The IT ministry removed the need for government approval for untested and under-development AI models but emphasised the need for labelling AI-generated content and information to users about the possible inherent fallibility and unreliability of the output generated.

Kulkarni said that addressing the issue of deepfakes and misinformation will require clarifying the responsibility of all stakeholders in the internet ecosystem: developers, uploaders, disseminators, platforms and consumers of content.

''Penalty provisions for the development and dissemination of harmful deepfakes and misinformation could also create a deterrent effect. Technological solutions to tag potentially harmful content and shifting the burden on developers and disseminators to justify the use of such content could also be designed,'' he said.

By using a newly constructed measure of land unavailability, I find that firms in cities where construction is more constrained by geography substitute short-term debt with long-term debt, hold less internal cash, invest more on intangible assets and eventually generate more patents after the enactment of the law. Moreover, this positive effect of the reform on innovation is more profound for firms that have more tangible assets, that are dependent on debt financing and that are more financially constrained.

It is experiencing changes, such as the deployment of electric vehicles and distributed energy sources. Meanwhile, cybernetworks are becoming coupled into the physical grid to an increasing degree. This transformation of electrical grids into smart grids is often the focus of research literature. It is strongly linked to the concurrent evolution of the cyberinfrastructure, which is the focus of this thesis. It aims to support the incremental upgrade of data systems, taking real-world constraints into account, as well as opportunities offered by sensors and machine learning. With this background, two research questions have been identified: i) How to use available data more efficiently to improve asset management? and ii) How much and which kind of new data are actually needed?With regard to the first research question, ways to use available data more efficiently are investigated in collaboration with a distribution system operator (DSO). One option is for DSOs to adopt best practices in terms of data management, which include: de-silo data, enhance reporting practices, and automatize tasks. To illustrate how combining available data may deliver additional relevant information, criticality indices have been calculated and assigned to components of a substation, by combining outage data, operation data and network diagram. Another option is to develop machine learning algorithms to perform specific or new tasks. A failure warning system has been developed using machine learning to leverage existing data about power components. It provides component-specific red flags, in situations where the widespread installation of component-specific sensors is unrealistic.With regard to the second research question, a methodology has been developed to identify which data are actually needed. The approach is scenario-based, and formalizes mathematically the relations between data, grid management and grid performance. It has been applied in three studies. One study uses the methodology to explore impacts of data quality on grid management costs, and to evaluate the most profitable amount of investment needed into data quality improvement.

Grid connection signifies the delivery of the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity from the fourth reactor of the nuclear energy plant, marking a pivotal moment in the nation's clean energy transition and journey towards Net Zero by 2050.

Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of clean electricity capacity to power the national grid, representing another significant step forward towards full-fleet operations, further supporting the UAE's efforts in enhancing grid stability and energy security through abundant around-the-clock zero-emissions electricity.

The Nawah teams at Barakah have worked closely with the Abu Dhabi Transmission and Despatch Company (TRANSCO), a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PSJC (TAQA), who constructed the overhead lines to connect the Barakah Plant to the Abu Dhabi grid - ensuring the power generated at Barakah is safely, securely and reliably delivered to consumers across the country.

Grid connection of Unit 4 solidifies the Barakah Plant's position as the cornerstone of the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategy, contributing significantly to the nation's clean energy portfolio. It not only propels the UAE towards achieving its ambitious climate goals but also positions the country as a leader in nuclear energy and decarbonization. The operational readiness of all four units underscores the UAE's commitment to diversifying its energy sources, ensuring the reliability and sustainability of its energy sector for the next six decades.

Mohamed Al Hammadi, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ENEC, said: ""We are proud to have achieved another critical milestone for the Barakah Plant, which stands as a testament to the UAE's leadership in the development of large-scale multi-unit nuclear fleets. Grid connection of Unit 4 puts us well on the path to full-fleet commercial operations, and with that, the ability to generate 40TWh of clean, baseload electricity annually to drive our Net Zero economy, offering a competitive edge to many businesses, decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries, while presenting a global benchmark for the entire nuclear energy industry.""

The fourth unit is nearing the start of commercial operations. Following grid connection, Unit 4 will undergo the process of gradually raising power levels, known as Power Ascension Testing (PAT). The process will be continuously monitored and tested until maximum electricity production is reached, while adhering to all local regulatory requirements and the highest international standards of safety, quality and security.

Each Unit has been connected to the grid more efficiently than the previous unit, as institutional knowledge and experience are applied to each subsequent unit. Unit 3 was delivered four months faster than the Unit 2 schedule, and five months faster than the Unit 1 schedule, demonstrating the significant benefit of building multiple units within a phased timeline.

Backed by the success of the Barakah Plant, ENEC is at the forefront of pioneering initiatives aimed at shaping the future of clean energy. ENEC's focus on advancing nuclear technologies, across large-scale PWR reactors through to Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and microreactors through the ENEC ADVANCE Program, aims to further strengthen the UAE's leadership in climate action and clean energy transition. This strategic direction not only amplifies the UAE's contributions to global decarbonization efforts but also showcases the potential of advanced nuclear technologies in meeting the world's growing energy needs sustainably.",eyeofriyadh.com,news,eyeofriyadh.com,,0.6941176470588235,448964214,1,https://www.eyeofriyadh.com/news_images/2024/03/35e09a04689b4.jpeg,

The viral infection was passed from a patient to a doctor, but the doctor's symptoms have improved, the NIID said earlier this week.

The doctor, a man in his 20s, attended to a patient in his 90s who had been diagnosed with SFTS after visiting the emergency room last April due to deteriorating health, the institute said.

The doctor performed various procedures on the patient who later died, including removing his catheter post-mortem, during which the doctor reportedly wore a face mask and gloves but no goggles.

Approximately nine days after the patient's death, the doctor developed symptoms of fever and headache, and was diagnosed with SFTS upon medical examination, it added.

""I wanted to pioneer an off-grid lifestyle and create a place for people to connect with nature without sacrificing comfort,"" he says.

Pawel's three handmade Mongolian yurts and log cabin, tucked away in 2.5 acres on a hill overlooking the Stavros tis Psokas valley, offer just that. We stayed in the spacious Qadan (meaning ""cliff"" in Mongolian), which sits on the edge of the property - hammock, table and chairs ready for sundowners or stargazing. Inside, there's a super-comfy wrought iron double bed, rugs, stove, coffee-making kit, Bluetooth speaker and wifi - you name your creature comfort and the attentive Pawel has thought of it.

The other two yurts, as well as Koliba, the newly built cabin, are family-friendly. Set several metres apart to afford privacy, all have outside showers and compostable loos that use a combination of sawdust and bokashi to dispose of waste. There is also one conventional loo for ""those who want to try being closer to nature,"" says Pawel, ""but don't want to compromise their comfort in the name of water conservation and keeping the aquifer clean!""

Reached by a long gravel track, Pawel's eco-retreat is the last inhabited property before entering the forested Troodos mountains 2km to the east. It feels blissfully remote, but the tiny village of Simou is nearby and it is only a 20-minute drive to the small port of Polis Chrysochou and Latchi fishing village. You can take a boat trip from here, some glass-bottomed and offering dips in the celebrated Blue Lagoon, or go for a swim on the beach before a blowout fish meze at Y&P Fish Tavern, part of the Latchi Hotel.

Pawel himself lives in the welcoming Straw House, home also to four cats and Shuki, a 10-year-old pointer cross rescue dog. ""His name comes from śukravāsaraḥ, meaning Friday in Sanskrit,"" says Pawel, ""the day our paths crossed at the local dog shelter."" Pawel will provide guests with a GPS for self-guided hikes or bike rides, but many prefer Shuki as a guide. ""He's well known for accompanying guests,"" says Pawel, who hosts yoga and pilates sessions in the pavilion beneath the house and advises on local rock-climbing, water sports and horse riding. For the latter, George's Ranch offers riding for all levels, but experienced riders can take a 90-minute sunset hack across the clifftops and sandy beaches of the Sea Caves natural caverns, stopping at Agios Georgios, a small, natural harbour in the Akamas Peninsula National Park, home to gorges, hiking trails and stunning bays, including the Blue Lagoon.

Back at the Straw House, breakfast in Pawel's kitchen includes halloumi, scrambled eggs, olives and endless coffee. He will also cook a vegetarian or vegan supper for guests (€17pp or €10pp for under 12s). Mains might include baked courgette with rosemary and garlic, served with cinnamon rice, warm bread, salad and marinated chilli, or ajapsandali, a Georgian aubergine stew served with bulgur wheat and local sheep yoghurt.

Guests help themselves to local wine or beer, nicely chilled thanks to electricity generated by solar panels and a wind turbine. Only 2-4% of energy use is generated by a back-up diesel generator and, in 2021, Pawel installed a solar-powered well pump. ""We are totally independent when it comes to water for our household, guests and our extensive irrigation system,"" he says proudly.

One day I joined Pawel on an early-morning mountain bike (four are available to hire), doing a section of a 15km loop that passes through the abandoned Turkish villages of Istinjo, Melandra, Zacharia and Sarama, a legacy of the Turkish invasion of the island. The 1974 partition of Cyprus and the uprooting of residents is brought starkly to life. The landscape takes no sides, and the beauty is uplifting. We pass the medieval stone-built Skarfos Bridge on the Evretou river. It is an ancient Venetian bridge, poppies growing on its banks, and you can spot Skarfos watermill in the near distance. Evretou reservoir, itself home to two abandoned villages, is a birder's paradise, and a good spot for fishing and foraging. You can see it on the track as you drive up to Pawel's yurts.

""I've seen mouflon on these trails,"" Pawel tells me, referring to an endangered wild sheep famed for its sickle-shaped horns and endemic only to the Troodos mountains. Sadly, we don't spot any when we visit Omodos, a village in the north-western Troodos with a lovely main square with tavernas and cafés. While it's a good starting point for hikes, unimpressed children might prefer a visit to the mouflon enclosure in the Troodos forestry station near Stavros, where 30 of these shy, endangered marvels can be seen up close.

For grownups, there are different marvels on offer in the form of the Byzantine churches throughout the Troodos region. For me, the highlight was Agios Nikolaos tis Stegis, or Church of St Nicholas of the Roof, an 11th century Byzantine monastery. This Unesco World Heritage site is 5km from the don't-miss narrow cobbled village of Kakopetria on the Karkotis river in the Troodos foothills.

This church is distinctive not only for its pitch timber roof and domed cross-in-square structure, but for its magnificent frescoes, dating from the 11th to 17th centuries, that cover every wall. Particularly notable is a rare portrayal of a breastfeeding Madonna, a magnet of which has been on my fridge ever since our visit. In my head, meanwhile, I carry the promise of a return to the hopefulness and warm welcome offered by Pawel, a man who continues to build - and share - his dream of sustainable tourism. ""It's so rewarding,"" he tells me. ""I am grateful for every visitor.""",ca.style.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!,,0.1843137254901961,448963778,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a2977be2a1e8202621a67f68b47d6ea4,

A series of events for primary and secondary school teaching staff marked the first time Digital Jersey held sessions specifically for local educators about the new technology.

The events, which were hosted with Skills Jersey and the Children, Young People, Education and Skills Department at the Digital Jersey Hub, explored the opportunities and challenges of using AI to support teaching methods, empower teachers, and open up new avenues for learning in a safe way.

During the sessions, teachers learned how AI could increasingly be used to help them save time in time-intensive areas of their work, such as lesson planning and marking, enabling them to focus on the more added-value and complex areas of teaching.

Educators also learned how to support students who wish to use AI tools responsibly, with a focus on the ethics, risks and limitations of the technology.

The head of the Digital Jersey Academy, Rory Steel, and AI marketing expert and Digital Jersey ambassador Vincent Sider delivered the sessions.

Mr Steel said: ""There are undoubtedly opportunities within teaching where AI can play a hugely valuable part.

""But it needs to be done well, recognising the risks, challenges and ethical issues that it brings.""

He added: ""We are starting to see schools in Jersey use AI in different ways, but use is at different stages.

""These sessions aimed to give local teachers, who are notoriously time-poor, a good platform to explore how AI could support their work and enhance the learning experience of students, outlining a number of practical steps they could take.""

In these papers I explore the dynamics of inflation markets and the interaction between the real economy, the nominal economy, and monetary policy. In the first paper, my coauthor and I, study one of the most pervasive arbitrage mispricings documented in Treasury bondmarkets: the relative mispricing of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). We find that the term structure of TIPS arbitrage mispricing predicts jointly inflation, and bond and equity excess returns. In the second paper, my coauthor and I, use inflation swap rates and break-even inflation rates to study how the effects of Fed's monetary policy actions transmit to inflation markets. This exercise leads us to a useful byproduct.

Talanoa Consulting director and principal consultant Marita Manley said the awards would be designed collaboratively over the next few months.

She said when thinking about sustainability, there was recognition that this subject was multifaceted.

Noting the multiple challenges faced by many in society, Ms Manley said businesses had a huge role to play in addressing those issues.

""Regardless of what you're doing, you have a role to play in addressing some of our society's most fundamental issues, even if it's very minor, even if it is making sure that we are properly managing our wastes.

""The last week has once again shown how disastrous climate risks can be both for our households, our families, as well as our business operations.

So we know that it is incumbent on all of us to be taking these risks more seriously.

""And one of the things that we really want to do is to acknowledge the work that has been done in this space, acknowledge the champions amongst all of you, who are leading the way because businesses are a massive massive part of the solution.""

Ms Manley said the words that were garnered from participants during an exercise on sustainability would be used to form the design of the Green Star Awards.

""This is about our legacy. It's about what we are leaving for the next generation. It's about preserving the things that we have now to make sure that it's still available for our children and our grandchildren and their children.""",fijitimes.com.fj,news,The Fiji Times,Timoci Vula,0.2549019607843137,448963589,1,https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WIN-D2e.jpg,

Consequently, Nigeria becomes the first country in Africa to launch the International Sustainability Standard Board (ISSB) sustainability financial reporting standard.

The roadmap for the adoption of the reporting standard was launched at a session with the chairman of ISSB/IFRS Foundation, Mr. Emmanuel Faber, organised by FRCN and NGX RegCo in Lagos.

Speaking, the chief executive officer, FRCN, Mr. Rabiu Olowo said, the launch of the roadmap asserts Nigeria leadership role in the adoption of the ISSB's sustainability standard.

Olowo revealed that President Bola Tinubu, during a visit of the ISSB's team to him in Abuja earlier, expressed affirmation in his commitment for the adoption of ISSB's proposition and framework for the sustainability standard in Nigeria.

He explained that the unveiling of the roadmap, is in line with ISSB's launch of its two inaugural sustainability standards, namely; IFRS S1, for disclosure of sustainability related financial information and IFRS S2 for climate related disclosure in June 2023.

Olowo said, sustainability financial reporting standard unlocks capital flow, improve transparency across value chains, leading to greater and healthy competitiveness for companies.

He noted that, the financial reporting standard also lead to increase Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), portfolio investment, job creation, promote economic and social resilience, in line with the economic policies of the present government.

The FRCN boss said the visit of Faber to Nigeria underscores the importance Nigeria attaches in aligning with global framework, especially as it affects corporate practices, of which sustainability has become a critical component.

The chairman of ISSB, Mr. Emmanuel Faber stated that, financial reporting must encompass sustainability standard which addresses climate change and transition risk, which is inevitable for businesses and nation.

He further said the ISSB sustainability financial reporting standard would help Nigeria community and corporations to becoming the most transparent and credible in supply chains and before investors, using appropriate metrics. Faber pledged that the ISSB would fully support Nigeria in the implementation of the roadmap of the sustainability standard to build business model for a more resilient and economic stability.

Also, the chief executive officer, NGX RegCo, Mr. Femi Shobanjo expressed optimism that all financial market stakeholders would remain committed to good Corporate Governance practices and abide by the rules of NGX and other extant laws in the country.

In a goodwill message, the president, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and also president, Nigeria Integrated Reporting Committee (NIRC), Dr. Innocent Okwuosa said, while the FRCN has put in place mechanism to ensure that the country get the implementation of the financial standard right, it is important to ensure that the capacity of the implementation is effective.",leadership.ng,news,Leadership,Olushola Bello,0.1058823529411765,448963581,1,https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FRC-NEW-LOGO.png-1200x600-1.png,

For 90 minutes last Wednesday, reportedly at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice, Democrats in the Maine Legislature attended a closed-door ""information session"" with James P. Vann, deputy director for enforcement programs and services at the ATF.

Their Republican colleagues, offered the same type of closed-door briefing, said no to the offer.

""We all agree that transparency is of the utmost importance, and we have no desire to meet with the ATF behind closed doors,"" Rep. Jennifer Poirier, R-Skowhegan, told the Press Herald. ""We're totally against any private meeting.""

Housing market crunch: The rise in interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve in recent years hasn't just put a strain on the broader housing market in the United States -- it's dealt a particularly heavy blow to those involved in home flipping, from small-scale contractors to well-known faces from reality TV.

Take Tarek El Moussa, for instance, known for his role in HGTV's ""The Flipping El Moussas"" and formerly co-hosting ""Flip or Flop."" El Moussa openly admits to taking a major hit financially due to the impact of interest rates on his ventures, stating bluntly, ""I got my ass kicked last year. I lost a lot of money.""

Flipping frenzy fades

Indeed, the fervour surrounding house flipping, which involves buying and often renovating properties with the aim of selling them at a profit, has seen a notable decline since the peak experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Figures from property data provider ATTOM Data Solutions indicate a nearly 39 per cent drop in the number of Americans participating in the housing market as investors between 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2023. Similarly, a report from real estate and mortgage firm Redfin highlights an 11 per cent year-over-year decrease in the share of homes purchased by investors over the same period.

Despite these declines, housing investors still have poured $32.3 billion into US properties in 2023. However, this marked a decrease from the $33.6 billion spent the previous year. Additionally, flippers found themselves grappling with a sluggish market characterised by limited inventory and tepid demand, a stark contrast to the frenetic activity seen during the initial stages of the pandemic.

For individuals like Elisa Covington, a Bay Area-based investor, the returns on investment that once soared to heights during 2021 have now tapered off to more modest levels, typically ranging between 30 per cent to 40 per cent. The reduced demand from homebuyers would theoretically ease the process for investors seeking single-family homes. Still, the persistent lack of inventory has posed a major challenge, impacting acquisition trends.

Construction suffers setback

Meanwhile, construction companies have also felt the pinch, with decreased home investment leading to a decline in new business activity. Ghulam Mustafa, owner of Sahara Builders in New York, reports a 40 per cent drop in profits since 2021 due to a reduction in full-gut renovation projects.

The repercussions extend to contractors as well, who find themselves contending with lower profit margins and reduced labour resources for renovations, consequently slowing down sales. Julio Martinez of JATS Properties in Los Angeles recounts having to let go of a full-time handyman, resulting in less attention dedicated to home-flip projects.

In response to these challenges, flippers are diversifying their strategies. Martinez has ventured into making property-secured loans to aspiring investors, while El Moussa has shifted his focus towards wholesaling home purchase contracts as a less risky alternative to traditional flipping.

Reality TV adapts

The impact of these market shifts is also reflected in the world of reality TV, with HGTV experiencing a decline in ad revenue from shows like ""The El Moussas."" To adapt, the network is exploring new show formats focusing on more approachable price points and alternative housing configurations to maintain viewer engagement.

China's automotive industry, elevated by a sizable push from the state, has seen a swift rise in electric vehicle technology, resulting in it becoming a frontrunner in EVs and related components, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

The revised policy initiative for India to become a hub for e-vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will result in a steep rise in dependence on auto component imports from China, as per the report.

India's auto component imports were $20.3 billion in 2022-23, with 30 per cent of them coming in from China.

With EVs gaining more attention in the country, auto component imports from China are likely to see further uptick since they have a greater hold over the supply chain of EV components. If estimates are to be believed, China has 75 per cent of the world's battery production capacity. Notably, battery comprises of 40 per cent of an electric vehicle's cost. It also accounts for over 50 per cent of global EV production and exports.

In the next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on India roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through Joint Venture with Indian firms, as per the report.

""China's EV exports to the European Union and the United States are declining due to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars/EV batteries,"" he said.

JSW MG Motor India, which is a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group, recently announced a capital infusement of Rs 5,000 crore to elevate production capacity and bring forth one new car every 3-6 months from September.

China's biggest automaker SAIC Motor also signed a joint venture with the JSW Group in November last year to accelerate the transformation and growth of MG Motor in India.

As per the JV, the merged entities aim to sell one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030, with the total market expected to reach 10 million units per year.

Notably, SAIC Motor is the parent company of British brand MG Motor. SAIC Motor is headquartered in Shanghai.

GTRI said that apart from SAIC Motors, other Chinese car companies like BYD Auto have positioned themselves in India by with options for electric vehicles encompassing buses, trucks, cars, and SUVs.

""Other Chinese companies, including Changan Automobile, Jinko Solar, and several bus and truck manufacturers like Zhongtong Bus and Foton Motor, also contribute to China's automotive presence in India,"" Srivastava said, adding that Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobile are also looking to enter the Indian market, indicating an increasing Chinese influence in India's automotive sector.

India's automobile industry contributes 7.1 per cent to the country's GDP, which has gone up from 2.8 per cent in 1992-93, the report highlighted.

It contributes to employment opportunities for over 19 million individuals directly and indirectly.

""The large-scale entry and market dominance of Chinese automakers in India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in EV value chain space, and battery import most parts and components from China,"" it underlined.

China has robust plans to elevate its passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle presence in India, after flooding the market with e-rickshaws and two-wheelers, it added.

The government and industry stakeholders are required to meticulously manage any risks of over-depending on foreign manufacturers and potential trade imbalances, the report suggested.

""India's decision to allow Chinese car makers in India and cutting import tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) will benefit Chinese manufacturers directly or indirectly being the dominant suppliers of EV batteries. Supply chain dependence on China will sharply increase even when non-Chinese companies (Tesla, Vinfast) set shop in India,"" Srivastava said.

Of late, India announced an EV policy which brings down import duty on electric vehicles (four-wheelers) from 70-100 per cent to 15 per cent in case of a foreign company investing a minimum of $500 million in the country in the sector.

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly made it clear within minutes of the passage of the NDP's motion on the Gaza war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that the government didn't regard it as just another non-binding opposition day motion that could be swiftly forgotten.

""This is clearly the intent of this government, to make sure that we follow what is written in this motion,"" she said. ""And that is why we've worked very hard to make sure that we could get to a text where we could abide by it.""

In fact, most of the original text in the motion was rewritten during last-minute talks between New Democrats and Liberals.

That extensive rewrite changed or toned down much of the substance of the original motion, and completely removed its most controversial clause -- the one calling for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, a move already taken by 139 other countries.

Disappointment among those who had pushed for a stronger motion coloured initial reactions to it. New Democrats countered that they had still won important concessions that would do more to protect Palestinian civilians in the short term.

""We were able to force the government to move on things that they had not supported before,"" said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. ""Things that will provide immediate relief to people on the ground in Gaza.""

NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson, the driving force behind the motion, pointed to specific achievements.

""We can now hold the government accountable for a ceasefire, for access, for humanitarian care, to make sure Canadians in Gaza are able to come home, to make sure that arms are no longer being sent to Israel,"" she said.

Neither one that night mentioned one of the few clauses in the deal that was not heavily rewritten during negotiations.

That clause may yet turn out to be the most significant part in the long run, said international law professor Mark Kersten of the University of the Fraser Valley, who in November testified before the Commons foreign affairs committee about Canada's legal position on the conflict.

""I was actually surprised that part stayed in the motion,"" he told CBC News, ""because it is one of the few things that I think is a diametrical shift in what the Liberals have said in the past, or what the government has ever said in the past.""

That part of the final text says Canada will:

Those simple words, if they're turned into policy, represent a reversal of Canada's previous positions, said Kersten.

""There's no statement from a senior government official ever that has said they would support the ICC in relation to the Palestinian situation,"" he said.

Kersten said that, according to what he's heard about the negotiations, the Liberals were reluctant to allow those clauses to go through.

""But it came down to the last five minutes and they had to say either go or no,"" he said. ""And it had already been watered down so much that that part survived.""

McPherson agreed that those clauses reverse Canada's previous positions on Israel.

""Our expectation, based on the motion the government supported, is a significantly changed approach to the International Criminal Court,"" she said. ""This meaningful step forward brings Canada in step with international law.

""Canada must support, and of course recognize, ICC/ICJ investigations and decisions.""

Canada has long argued that neither the ICJ -- which essentially sues governments -- nor the ICC -- which prosecutes individuals -- should have any jurisdiction over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because Israel has not accepted their jurisdiction, and Palestinians cannot ask for their protection or intervention because Palestine is not a recognized state.

Canada most recently reiterated that position at a UN-mandated ICJ hearing on Israeli policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in February.

But under the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada has gone much further. The government has sent letters to ICC prosecutors warning them not to pursue cases against Israel or Israelis -- while reminding them that Canada is one of the court's major sources of funding.

McPherson told CBC News the new motion should prevent those interventions.

""Now the Liberal government can't pick and choose when they'll support the work of the court, and when they'll interfere based on which countries are under investigation,"" she said.

Kersten said that while the Trudeau government's policy may have been intended to shield Israeli officials from legal accountability, it also has the effect of opposing the prosecution of leaders of Hamas for their well-documented war crimes against Israelis -- effectively placing the entire conflict under an umbrella of legal impunity that is the opposite of the rules-based international order the government says it supports.

James Kafieh, vice-president of the Palestinian Canadian Congress, called the two clauses ""a 180-degree reversal"" that was ""long overdue.""

""It does represent a real material change in Canadian policy"" toward the two international courts, he told CBC News. ""Canada has worked relentlessly to undermine these. And an obvious example is Canada sending regular briefs to the International Criminal Court to argue that Palestine has no jurisdiction, that the court had no jurisdiction to hear any complaints from the Palestinians, effectively giving Israel political cover.""

CBC News asked Global Affairs Canada about what that part of the motion would mean for Canadian policy, but received no response.

Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, who opposed the motion and says he is now reconsidering his future in the Liberal caucus, said the motion violated an understanding that the Trudeau government would follow Stephen Harper's famously pro-Israel approach to the conflict -- with one exception.

""This would be completely in violation of what the Liberal Party has promised in 2015, 2019, in 2021,"" he told CBC News, ""which is that Canada would be an ally of Israel and that our policy would be no different than the Conservatives with respect to Israel, other than the fact that we wouldn't make this a wedge issue.""

His reaction to his government's decision to back an amended version of the motion was mirrored by responses from the Israeli government and from Canadian pro-Israel organizations, some of whom focused on the damaging symbolism of prohibiting arms exports to Israel.

""By adopting such a one-sided and irresponsible motion, the House has expressed an appalling degree of disregard for Israel's right to defend itself,"" said David Granovsky of B'nai Brith Canada.

""It's regrettable that the Canadian government is taking a step that undermines Israel's right to self-defence against Hamas terrorists,"" tweeted Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz. ""History will judge Canada's current action harshly.""

Idit Shamir, Israel's consul-general in Toronto, went further. ""Now Canada is going to deny weapons to Israel?"" she asked in a tweet. ""That's going to be a moment that Canada's going to have to deal with now for 10, 20, 30, 40 years. That in Israel's darkest moment they abandon it. That's what they just did and frankly I think it's shameful.""

Palestinian advocates saw that part of the motion as a major victory, although a symbolic one.

""It's very significant not because Canada sells a lot of weapons to Israel. We're limited to about $20 million a year -- very little,"" Kafieh told CBC News.

""The real problem, as is witnessed in the Jerusalem Post's editorial about it, is that Israel is in a full panic because this essentially gives permission for other western allies that have historically aided and abetted Israel to take similar action. And that's the beginning of censure, the beginning of holding Israel accountable to international laws.""

Montreal-born Knesset member Dan Illouz, a member of the governing Likud party, sent a letter to Joly warning that the arms ban ""sends a dangerous signal to the world."" It comes as Israel faces warnings from other governments that its access to their arms could be limited.

British and Israeli media reported Friday that U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron has ordered a review of Israel's actions that could lead to a suspension of arms sales. Alicia Kearns, chair of the U.K. Parliament's foreign affairs committee, said a decision could come ""within the week"".

Cameron also warned Israeli officials they could face a Europe-wide ""arms embargo"" if they continue to deny Red Cross officials access to prisoners, as required by international law.

One arms contract that may yet cause problems for Canada is an Israeli order for 24,000 Armalite-style assault rifles that already has been the subject of a hold order from the U.S. government. Three-quarters of those rifles are to be supplied by Colt.

Colt's subsidiary Colt Canada (formerly Diemaco) manufactures small arms for the Canadian Forces and was expected to supply some of the Israeli contract.

Protests over the sale have targeted both the main Colt plant in West Hartford, Conn. and the Canadian plant in Kitchener, Ont.

But concerns haven't been limited to protesters. The U.S. State Department demanded reassurances from Israel that the rifles would not be given out to civilians or settlers as part of a large gun-giveaway program under the auspices of Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, head of the Jewish Power Party.

Ben Gvir, who has criminal convictions for supporting terrorism and inciting hatred, has held several such giveaways, pledged to issue 400,000 new civilian gun permits and recently boasted on X about arming 100,000 Israeli citizens since Oct 7.

Ben Gvir's opponents have warned that the guns are going to his far-right supporters, including violent West Bank settlers who use them to kill and displace Palestinian civilians.

Even Israel's defence minister has accused Ben Gvir of trying to create a private militia that could one day challenge the Israeli state.

CBC News asked Global Affairs Canada about the proposed sale but received no response.

Much of the rest of the motion was merely a reiteration of existing policies, or of measures the Liberal government already had announced it would back.

A commitment to sanction extremist settlers, who have dramatically escalated their attacks on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank under the current government, already had been made verbally by Joly on February 4 (although there has been no follow-up).

The call for an ""immediate"" ceasefire also changed little. Canada already voted for such a ceasefire at the UN back on December 12, 2023. It repeated that call in conjunction with Australia and New Zealand on February 14.

As for Palestinian statehood, recognition was replaced with the language that has guided Canadian policy through decades of Liberal and Conservative governments -- language that leaves it up to the two parties to negotiate a division of the land.

Kafieh said that language ""is a non-starter"" given the Netanyahu government's declared intention to continue to oppose a two-state solution.

""Even if people made good faith efforts to support it,"" he said, ""fundamentally you have Palestinians who are a subject people in a room with the Israelis who dominate them.

""How are you supposed to free them or negotiate a settlement that could be based on anything other than the massive power imbalance that exists between the two parties?""

But Kafieh said he is confident that the statehood issue will return. McPherson said the same on Monday night.

For now, she said, New Democrats will make sure the Liberal government is not allowed to forget that it has changed its posture on the international courts' jurisdiction over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

""This cannot be an empty promise from the Liberal government,"" she said. ""New Democrats will continue to do the hard work of holding this government's feet to the fire. We'll use the tools we have in committee and Parliament to ensure the government honours their commitment to this approach that respects the role of the ICC/ICJ.""'

Kersten said it's the pressure applied after the fact that will determine how significant the change is.

""Whether or not it has an impact depends on, do people expect it to have an impact?"" he said.

""If no one thinks it has an impact, then it's just a vacuous statement saying, 'Support the ICC.'""

Kersten said most people have focused on issues such as statehood and weapons sales and have failed to notice the important legal change.

""And if that continues and this ICC/ICJ part of the motion falls out the bottom as a result of that, then it can't really change much because the Liberals don't want to act on that,"" he said.

""I don't think this motion changes the fact that they do not want to act on that.

The South West Coastal Path, which starts in Minehead and ends in Cornwall, was found to be the walk that produces the biggest smiles among walkers worldwide.

The study, from outdoor holiday provider Inghams, analysed over 300 Instagram posts to reveal which walking trails make people smile the most.

Smile-recognition software was used to see which popular trails around the world are bringing the biggest smiles to walkers' faces.

The software analysed the scale of the smiles in pictures of people conquering trails and summits around the world, to generate a happiness score.

This score could then be recorded and compared, to reveal a tangible measurement of happiness for some of the world's most naturally beautiful walking spots.

The South West Coast Path came top of the list with an overall happiness score of 99.30.

The trail is the longest national path in England at 630 miles long, and takes walkers along the coastlines of popular English walking destinations such as Somerset, Devon, Cornwall and Dorset.

A spokesperson for Inghams said: ""A grin is sure to appear on walkers' faces as they explore this trail and admire some of Britain's most delightful beaches and clifftop views, hear the seabirds calling, smell the salty air and enjoy an ice-cream in a picturesque seaside village. ""

The Somerset path ranked above the Blue Mountains in Australia, which ranked third with a score of 98.38, as well as the Candian Rockies (93.67) and the Alps (93.66).",somersetcountygazette.co.uk,news,Somerset County Gaz,,0.6392156862745098,448963339,1,https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/resources/images/17878664/,

Situated in Lydiard Millicent, SN5, Selbrook House is detached among around two and a half acres of grounds.

The 'expansive' home is being marketed by McFarlane Sales for £1,950,000.

It was built 121 years ago and has been in the same ownership for many years with numerous extensions and updates taking it to 985 square feet.

The house itself has three baths, four double rooms and a garden room 'that boasts views of the expansive, lawned garden'.

The estate agent says: ""The property has been sympathetically, extended by the current owners to include a double storey extension and contemporary garden room.

""There is light and airy décor throughout with a spacious and accommodating feel.""

The master bedroom's ensuite bathroom features an inset Jacuzzi bath with separate walk in double shower cubicle.

Outdoors has an outdoor entertainment area, and a pond which apparently has an abundance of flora and fauna.

The listing says: ""There are extensive views to the rear over open countryside, there is also an expansive garden pond with an abundance of wildlife and habitation.

""The main lawn has mature tended borders with a bespoke covered timber outside entertainment area.""

Although this house might feel very rural, it is only a twelve minute drive from Swindon railway station, meaning that you could easily get to London or Bristol from this idyll.

However, you will need a car because the driveway alone is 100 yards long, accessed through wrought iron double gates with a detached double garage and workshop.

However, perhaps best of all is the separate outhouse, currently used as an office, but which the agent suggests could be turned into another house.

Although this place would set you back a bit, you could be getting two houses for the price of one.

The price of the house has dropped considerably from when it was first listed on March 29, 2023 for £2,200,000, with the price being reduced in December.

According to Zoopla, the average estimated value of a property in SN5 has dropped by nearly £34,000 in the last 12 months, with an average sale price of £394,151.",swindonadvertiser.co.uk,news,Adver Sport Desk,Ben Gardner,0.02745098039215677,448963217,1,https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17891368/,

The Diplomatic Bluebook for 2024 will also underscore that Tokyo ""cannot afford to waste even a moment"" to solve the long-standing issue of North Korea's past abductions of Japanese nationals as the victims' families continue to age, according to the draft obtained by Kyodo News.

""China has been continuing and intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force"" and ""military activities"" in waters surrounding Japan, including the South and East China seas, the draft paper said.

Such moves by China have put Japan in ""the most severe and complex"" security environment and should be addressed by collaborating with like-minded nations not only its close security ally the United States but also the Philippines, Australia and South Korea, the draft said.

With Beijing's territorial claims and expanding military activities in mind, Japan, the United States and the Philippines have been strengthening security collaboration in recent years.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to meet with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on April 11 in Washington, the first-ever trilateral summit for the countries. They are expected to agree on deeper cooperation.

In the draft police, Japan also urged China to immediately lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood products, which was introduced following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan's disaster-hit Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea that began in August, Kyodo news reported.

As for the abductions by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, Japan renewed its pledge to make efforts in realising the return of all the victims as soon as possible, according to the draft.

It would connect an additional 21GW of offshore wind off the coast of Scotland to the grid, delivering a world-leading offshore wind sector with more than 86GW of capacity in total. It is claimed that that the proposed investment in onshore and offshore network infrastructure would lead to a net benefit to consumers of up to £2.1 billion from avoiding the costs associated with network congestion. It's an ambitious programme which would involve some extensive grid upgrades on shore, but would also include a lot more undersea cabling- in all, three times more offshore than onshore by 2035, some of the new undersea grids being very long, linking north and south. There will be shoreline landing-point impacts for the subsea cables, and on shore links from them to the wider grid system, but in general, offshore location should avoid some local land use conflicts. However, undersea links are costly. NG-ESO note that subsea grids are up to 8 times more expensive than above ground tower mounted cables, which can carry 3 times more power. So there will still be some new land-based links, and we can expect some bitter local pylon siting battles. But on the socially positive side, the ESO claims the plan would create and sustain around 20,000 jobs annually, with 90% of the benefits occurring outside London and the South East, with, for example, a new electrical spine between Peterhead and Merseyside. Extra grids are not the only issue. NG-ESO says that, as renewables expand, 'one of the biggest problems Great Britain faces is the inability to easily store large volumes of electricity.' It notes that 'grid-scale storage is becoming increasingly important in managing peaks and troughs in the electricity system. Currently this is being done through large-scale batteries and hydro schemes, however it is unlikely that it can be built out in sufficient quantities to manage long-term fluctuations in output'. But it says that, as an alternative to storage, electricity can be used differently via Demand Flexibility Schemes, where 'customers are financially incentivised to reduce their electricity consumption to help manage the energy system at times of peak electricity demand.' NG-ESO warns that UK power demand may rise dramatically: 'In the future we will need to generate significantly more electricity. We project that by 2035, demand for electricity may rise by up to 65% and that by 2050 demand could more than double'. And it says that, while system flexibility, interconnection, storage and hydrogen production can reduce the stress on the, given the rise in demand, 'we will still need to redevelop parts of the transmission network'. is NG-ESO right that we will need many more new links, whatever the type, since power demand will rise rapidly? Presumably that projection is partly based on the assumption that the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps will boom massively. But they may not - there are in any case alternative transport and heating scenarios, e.g. with bioenergy and green synfuels playing more of role. And, even leading aside the big debate about moving to an 'energy sufficiency' demand-matching approach and the wider de-growth issues, the potential for energy saving in most sectors is huge. The NG-ESO plan is pretty relentlessly an electrification plan. As I argue in my next post (out after an Easter break), local heat nets linked to heat stores and fed via Combined Heat and Power plants, can also play a role, not least in helping to balance the increasingly renewables-based system.

The EU and its Member States are building out interconnectors to improve security of supply and affordability of electricity through the physical and economic linking of national energy markets into a single, synchronised European market. But each interconnector is expensive, complex and therefore risky. They can span long distances or natural obstacles such as mountains or seas. Significant network planning and adaptation is needed to account for the additional capacity when different markets are connected. Jean-Baptiste Vaujour at the Emlyon Business School reviews the landscape, and surveys the different ways interconnectors are being financed. The usual revenues, mostly congestion charges, are particularly risky: they are exposed to market developments on both sides of any border and to changes in price volatility as the penetration of renewables rises.

The roles are cyber incident investigation specialist, threat analysis specialist, ICT product manager, artificial intelligence (AI) applied researcher, AI/machine learning engineer, and development operations engineer and is open to foreign talent.

This is according to a report by the Singapore Department of Statistics (Singstat).

These roles are increasingly relevant as Singapore pursues its digital economy goals, forging strategic partnerships and initiatives to harness technologies like AI and promote business digitalization.

The addition of these roles is also to respond to the rising number of cyber threats targeting both businesses and individuals.

To meet the anticipated rise in demand for sustainability-related jobs, Singstat identified four occupations which have been introduced for the green economy.

These occupations are: environmental analyst, energy portfolio manager, sustainability project development/management professional, and environmental commodities trader.

Singstat's research also identified a growing need for carbon management services and associated job roles.

The inclusion of new codes addresses specific job functions and emerging industries' requirements. For instance, agriculturist and aquaculturist roles now have distinct codes, having previously been grouped under a residual code for less common occupational categories.

Additionally, new codes have been established for non-financial risk analysts, reflecting their evolving responsibilities compared to generic policy-planning professionals, and executive secretaries, acknowledging their increased skill requirements in supporting top executives with specialized organizational and administrative tasks.

These changes are among those in Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) 2024, which follows the last edition published in 2020.

SSOC classifies occupations based on the type of work performed.

This is why the country aims to address the impact of the pandemic-induced departure of foreign workers, by hiring 260,000 new professionals, compensating for the loss of 194,000 foreign workers.

Despite boasting one of the oldest working markets in the country, it is accepted that there has been a slow decline in Earlestown town centre and St Helens Council successfully bid for £20m from the government's Levelling Up Fund to address this.

The council has also committed to a further £8m to support the regeneration project, which is planned to redevelop the town's market square, refurbish the town hall, and improve the town's railway station.

However, although Earlestown businesses have been crying out for investment in recent years, market traders are not convinced that the regeneration project will deliver the transformational change that developers say it will, with some having strong aversions to certain aspects of the plans.

Trader's main concern? Vehicle access

Shoppers and traders at the Friday morning Earlestown market (Image: St Helens Star)

On a relatively busy Friday morning - but nowhere near as busy as the market has been in years gone by, as traders tell me - the main issue raised was the parking and vehicle access under the new market plans.

At present, every trader has their vehicle next to their stall so they can quickly unload their products, re-stock if necessary, and quickly pack up at the end of the day. Some traders, such as the butchers and fishmongers, work inside their vans as they keep stock refrigerated.

However, under the council's detailed planning application that was submitted earlier this month, there are more restrictions regarding vehicle access as council planners believe there is a ""lack of structure"" as to how traders currently access and park in the square.

An all-weather canopy is a big part of the plans (Image: St Helens Council)

With a new all-weather canopy set to provide space for 60 traders, planning documents state how access will be ""controlled through vehicle restraints including raised planters, seating blocks, street trees, built elements, fixed bollards, and manually removable bollards"".

The plans suggest that there will also be space for 40 outdoor traders, and the vehicle restrictions will provide ""greater opportunities for the square to feel and operate as a secure and flexible space"".

Concrete seating blocks will be installed to ""avoid vehicle access to the market canopy"", with the council believing that a lack of parking structure has prevented the market from being a fully ""safe and inviting space"".

The council says that it is ""committed to making sure traders can easily park in the vicinity of the market"", and is exploring options such as designated parking areas for stall-holders alongside facilities for disabled people.

However, it has not yet been confirmed where these potential parking areas may be.

'If they remove vehicle access, half the traders will go'

In a sentiment shared by many traders in Earlestown, Dennis said: ""If [the council] removes vehicle access, half the traders will go.""

""I work out of my van, as do all the traders here, and I'm here to make money.

""I don't want to be running back and forth to my van all day to restock my products when I could be losing business, or I could have my products nicked or be at the mercy of the elements.""

Many other traders raised this issue, including Lynne Coltas, a Fleetwood fishmonger whose family business 'Syd's Fisheries' has been operating at Earlestown market for the past 50 years.

Lynne said: ""Almost everybody works by themselves here so how can you keep a stall running if you're constantly going back to restock?

""If you ask any trader here, parking and vehicle access will be their biggest concern, and I know some traders who have left and others who are looking elsewhere because of this.""

Like Lynne at Syd's Fisheries, Jade and Mark at A&R Meats also need their van to refrigerate their stock.

One of the busier stalls on the market, Mark suggested he will fight to ensure vehicle access is part of the plans as they ""make too much money not to have [their van] here"".

Jade suggested that they may need to go elsewhere if permanent vehicle access is not an option.

Market decline and 'limited communication'

Other concerns raised by traders include a perceived lack of communication with the council regarding the regeneration plans, as well as the current state of the market.

Bob and Mark Isherwood, a father and son whose family flower stall has been on Earlestown market for 100 years, said: ""The market is fairly busy but it's nothing to what it once was.

""This used to be our flagship stall but now it's one of the most difficult stalls we travel to. The market isn't maintained well and it hasn't had any proper advertising for years.

""We both said that the vehicle and parking wouldn't work from the get-go, but [the council] hasn't listened. There is limited parking around the square now so where are all these traders going to park?""

As traditional markets have had to battle with the rise of supermarkets, online shopping, retail parks, and more recently the pandemic and cost of living crisis, it can be argued it is inevitable that many have struggled and this isn't a case specific to Earlestown.

However, there are certain market areas quoted to be thriving, such as Bury and Chorley market, and some traders feel that there is a discrepancy in how these markets and Earlestown have been run.

Em and Kay Barlow, whose clothes stall has operated in Earlestown for the best part of 30 years, said: ""We work at different market stalls, as other traders do, and it feels at many of these you are supported and the council works with you.

""Unfortunately, it feels like St Helens Council is working against you at times.

""We have very limited communication with them and receive a leaflet of the plans every now and again. I've worked here for 30 years so why wouldn't you come and ask me what I'd like to see?

""Half of the market coverings are falling to pieces and some don't have any at all. We have bought our own gazebo but we are provided one at other markets.

""We do work at some markets where there is no vehicle access, such as in Liverpool (Great Homer Street), so this could potentially work.

""But the business is so busy there that it makes up for it. We're also supported by the council and parking is around the corner so it isn't too bad.""

Valu Bentley, a Kiwi baker, similarly said he isn't convinced about the councils's regeneration plans, and added that he has had limited communication about the future of the markets.

This reported lack of communication is something that was also raised by independent councillors in the area last month, who said they had hit a ""wall of silence"" after asking for updates and queries about the regeneration plans.

In response, the council said that ward members have been ""briefed at every step of the process"", although there are not always answers until key planning milestones are reached.

Some elements of the plans may not initially be released publicly if it is commercially sensitive, a spokesperson added.

The council also points to the series of consultations held in Newton and Earlestown last year as evidence of listening to public concerns, with more than 240 people said to have given feedback.

So, will the plans work?

Obviously, with £28m being invested in Earlestown and lots of hard work going on behind the scenes, the council and developers believe that the regeneration plans will ""transform the area back into a thriving and bustling market town"".

The council also aims to utilise the square as more than just a market space, with plans to install play areas, safe spaces to relax, and the potential to hold special events.

The feedback from the public consultations is also reported to have had 80% of people in favour of the proposed market canopy, with 73% of respondents believing that the plans would benefit the town.

68% said that they were likely to spend more time in Earlestown as a result.

However, after speaking to several market traders, there seems to be more apprehension than positivity, and more pessimism as opposed to optimism.

In addition to the vehicle and parking concerns, traders criticised the proposals to demolish the current public toilet building and move this off-site.

There was also criticism that the canopy is not planned to be installed along the Market Street side of the square, which some believe could attract more passing trade, as well as concerns about increasing market rates and what will happen to traders when construction of the canopy begins.

With Earlestown possessing such a historical market, all of the traders are in agreement that it is in dire need of investment if it is to survive.

However, the jury is still out as to whether these multi-million pound plans will be the answer that traders are looking for.

Statement from St Helens Council

The council aims to utilise the square with more than just the market (Image: St Helens Star)

In response to questions from the Star, a spokesperson for St Helens Council and ECF, said: ""Our proposals will provide a better environment for traders and shoppers, helping to support and grow Earlestown's historic market long into the future and encouraging more people to spend time in the town centre through the ability to host events all year round.

""There is currently a lack of structure to how traders access and park in the square, which does not help to create a safe and inviting space.

""The square will benefit from controlled vehicle access at its four corners, including secure bollards with ample loading space for market traders.

""We are committed to making sure traders can easily park in the vicinity of the market and we continue to consider a range of options for this, providing further updates as options progress.

""This could include designated areas for stall-holder parking and servicing alongside facilities for disabled persons, to create a safer and more vibrant Market Square.

""The Market Square's current use for indiscriminate public parking on non-market days does not create a welcoming environment and is not sustainable.

""A comprehensive, parking survey is taking place as part of the planning process to assess the suitability of existing facilities across the town centre and inform the development of a parking strategy to ensure Earlestown has an appropriate and fit-for purpose operational parking estate. Stakeholders will be engaged to help inform this parking strategy.

""The council reviews fees and charges each year for all services, including its markets, with updates to the council's webpages on an annual basis, and we'll continue to do so.""",sthelensstar.co.uk,news,St Helens Star,Conal Cunningham,0.2705882352941176,448963040,1,https://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/resources/images/17891624/,

Well-intentioned policies do not always produce favourable outcomes. Governments frequently implement policy changes with the noblest of intentions but encounter a variety of unintended consequences, often more severe than the problems they sought to resolve.

The recent decision by the Karnataka government to cap fares for both traditional and app-based taxis exemplifies how good intentions can lead to poor results.

To potentially prevent price gouging, and more importantly, to create a more equal competitive landscape between traditional taxi operators and the new-age app-based taxi service providers, the Government of Karnataka issued an order on February 3, 2024, establishing a uniform fare structure for all taxis, both traditional and app-based.

All taxi operators must now follow the price specified by the Government, which is linked to the underlying value of their vehicles.

Traditional taxi operators have struggled to compete with new-age, app-based taxi operators. Naturally, they have long lobbied for Government intervention. Consumers who happily migrated to app-based taxi service providers, lured in by lower introductory prices, are now loath to pay surge prices.

The Karnataka government seeks to solve both of these problems by fixing prices. In the process, Karnataka risks upsetting its credentials as a business-friendly destination, seeking to attract a greater number of entrepreneurs to set up shop in India's Silicon Valley - Bangalore and other parts of the state. Equally, its intervention will hurt consumers.

The fixed price structure, based on the value of the vehicles, will prevent excessive pricing. Customers will no longer be at the mercy of dynamic pricing algorithms or conventional taxi operators who endeavour to maximise profits by exploiting customers' limited options during rush hours, late hours or at remote locations.

The fixed price structure introduced by the Karnataka government does not impose price limits while offering flexibility to taxi operators to charge lower prices. Instead, it establishes flat fares for the first 4 kilometres and a fixed per-kilometre rate for subsequent distances. These flat fares vary depending on the value of the vehicles.

In essence, the Karnataka Government has introduced both a cap on the fares and a floor- by specifying a flat rate for vehicles valued within the same band.

Specifying floor prices hurts consumers the most - it deprives them of the benefit of reduced prices when demand trails supply. New-age, app-based taxi operators solved this problem - by deploying algorithms mapping demand and supply on a real-time basis to discover the optimum prices for consumers. Riders in Karnataka will no longer benefit from this innovation.

Floor prices mimic outcomes which otherwise result from collusion among competitors. Absent the Karnataka government's intervention, to achieve uniformity in prices, all taxi operators would have had to collude - a conduct prohibited under the Competition Act, 2002.

When competitors agree to fix prices, consumers pay more or get less (poor quality). This is precisely what the Karnataka Government has helped achieve - in Karnataka riders will no longer benefit from lower prices when supply outstrips demand. They must always pay the price that the Government thinks is appropriate.

Distinctions like vehicle type (hatchback, sedan, or SUV), the hum of air-conditioning, and top-notch service will no longer be relevant for determining taxi fares in Karnataka. Moreover, Karnataka which has established itself as the business-friendly, startup capital of India and a hub for innovation will no longer allow innovative business models in the ride-hailing industry.

India's ride-hailing industry showcases a variety of business models addressing diverse customer preferences. Uber and Ola lead as convenient and affordable options, connecting passengers with independent drivers via their apps and earning revenue through ride commissions.

However, they have less stringent control over vehicle maintenance. BluSmart offers a distinct experience with its all-electric fleet and focuses on reliability. Though slightly pricier, they guarantee zero cancellations, superior vehicle quality, and professional drivers.

InDrive introduces a unique model where passengers propose fares, allowing drivers to accept, reject, or counteroffer. This platform also operates on a commission-based revenue model.

Each of these competing business models will now have to be re-imagined to meet the lowest common price dictated by the Karnataka Government. In essence, the lack of flexibility to charge different prices would end up reducing competition among taxi operators.

They would no longer be able to compete on price. The inability to moderate prices to reflect higher demand, would constrain app-based taxi operators' ability to invest in improving the quality of their services.

Fixed rates for taxis will entail certain consequences. The reduced profitability resulting from standardised pricing may significantly decrease returns on capital investments. This could potentially discourage new operators from entering the market. Equally, it could reduce the flow of funding for new taxi services.",inc42.com,news,Inc42 Media,,-0.02745098039215688,448962916,10,https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-34.png,

Starting from a presentation of the international context and historical legacies, the study investigates the almost three-year-long Slovenian theoretical, parliamentary, economic, political and public debates (1990-1992) concerning the choice of model and institutional framework for large-scale privatization. In particular the legislative and discursive shaping of the text of the Law on Ownership Transformation of Enterprises is analyzed. The thesis addresses the design of a property rights regime as a genuinely political meta-process of structuring that involves a redistribution of social assets, with important economic and social consequences for different groups in society, through which the conception of a just society is redefined. The study applies the heterodox institutional approach to analyze institutional choices in the ""transition to market"". Such a perspective questions the simple causal explanations of the mechanisms of diffusion and the role of dominant ideas and ideologies in shaping institutions. Furthermore, the conventional understanding of institutions and history as structural constraints is challenged in order to open for the exploration of the conditions, mechanisms and processes of institutional change in terms of actors' contingencies for development of new institutions and path shifts through learning and problem-solving processes, interaction and interpretation.

China will make greater efforts to diffuse debt risks of financing platforms, said Chinese premier Li Qiang in a meeting focusing on mitigating risks of local government debt on Friday.

China will resolutely block the path for irregular and disguised debts and strictly prevent the risk of newly-added debts, said Li.

The Commerce ministry said on Friday that foreign investment into China fell 19.9% in the first two months of 2024 from the amount in January-February last year to 215 billion yuan ($30 billion).

China on Tuesday unveiled new steps to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment, including expanding market access and relaxing some rules.

Overseas firms have turned sour on China since it enacted ultra-strict COVID curbs during the pandemic then suddenly abandoned them in late 2022, with concerns over the business environment, a shaky economic recovery and rising geopolitical tensions with the West weighing on confidence.

A series of prolonged regulatory crackdowns on sectors from technology to education have also rattled domestic and foreign investors, adding to unease over policy transparency in China.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last year that American businesses had told her that China was becoming ""uninvestible.""

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China shank 8% year-on-year.

Of the foreign investment in the first two months, 71.44 billion yuan, or a third of the total, went into China's high-tech industries, including high-tech manufacturing, the ministry said.

Foreign investment in China's construction sector rose 43.6% year-on-year, while investment in wholesale and retail industries grew 14.5%, it added.

In return, China's central government accelerated spending at the start of the year, a sign it's taking on more financing responsibility to support the economy and to avoid worsening local government debt risks, Bloomberg reported.

Its general public expenditure jumped 14% from a year earlier to 482.8 billion yuan ($66.8 billion) in January and February combined, the fastest pace for the period in five years, according to data provided by the Ministry of Finance.

Bloomberg said Beijing is gradually shifting the responsibility for supporting economic growth to central government from local officials -- a way to maintain the level of investment while defusing local debt risks.

Local governments have been struggling after a property crisis reduced a critical source of income from land sales, and a slowing economy weighed on tax revenues.

The latest data shows Beijing intends to ""underpin growth while preventing risks,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.

Central and local authorities spent almost 700 billion yuan in the first two months on agriculture, forest and irrigation-related issues, as well as urban and rural community development. This is up 22% from a year earlier.

In a separate development, China's securities regulator launched onsite inspections of some mutual fund companies as part of efforts to strengthen management of the industry, unnerving fund managers.

The securities watchdog, under newly appointed Chairman Wu Qing, vowed a week ago to set up a ""textbook-style"" supervision model to regulate China's $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry, according to Reuters.

The latest round of inspections, conducted without notice by branches of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), covered daily operations, training, and strengthening internal Chinese Communist Party functions, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday. It did not name the asset managers inspected.

In response to a Reuters query, CSRC said: ""It's regular on-site inspection that we conduct every year.""

The CSRC branches inspected fund companies based outside their regions, which the article said can prevent local interference.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period.

China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum.

He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week.

But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of US business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict Covid curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.",gdnonline.com,news,Gulf Daily News Online,,0.08235294117647052,448962489,1,https://www.gdnonline.com/gdnimages/20240324\20240324103620chinoiise.JPG,

The drones were downed over parts of central, southern and southeastern Ukraine, the country's military said.

Energy workers are still working to restore electricity to some Ukrainians, though, a day after Moscow launched what Kyiv said was the largest attack of the war on the country's power grid, authorities said Saturday.

The ""technical possibility for electricity supply"" had been restored in most affected regions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. But the situation remained difficult in the region of Kharkiv, which was hit particularly hard.

People in Kharkiv city, as well as the western Khmelnytskyi region, were still without power, national grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement.

The Russian assault killed at least five people and left more than 1 million people without power. It also struck Ukraine's largest dam.

On Saturday morning, meanwhile, two people were killed and seven were injured in Ukrainian air attacks on Russia's Belgorod region, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

""It's shaping up to be a difficult morning,"" Gladkov said in a post on Telegram.

An overnight drone attack by Ukraine on Russia's Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery.

In turn, Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday its forces had taken control of the village of Krasnoye in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.

The recent trend where Polygon dropped by 3.52% in one month may push the price lower, approaching the nearest support at $0.82. If the downtrend persists, the second support at $0.63 could be tested. However, the six months surge of 89.44% showcases strong bullish momentum that could regain strength, possibly aiming for the nearest resistance at $1.13 and beyond towards $1.27. Optimism could stem from the growth over half a year, indicating a robust interest and potential for a recovering trajectory.

Considering the all-time high of $3, the current price of $0.99 shows that Polygon has room to grow. Long-term prospects seem promising if the cryptocurrency markets stay positive, potentially targeting previous peaks. The historical climb implies an underlying strength that could propel prices upward in the future. On the flip side, failure to maintain support could see further declines in the short term, keeping long-term ambitions in check. A balanced view suggests watching for fluctuations around the simple moving averages at $1.07 and $0.92 to gauge future direction.

Looking at the latest figures, Optimism has faced a dip of 12.28% over the past month. Nevertheless, zooming out to the six-month view, there's a significant climb of 174.41%. With the highs reaching $4.87, there's potential for growth. The current price at $3.57 sits comfortably above the nearest support of $2.95, suggesting a steady footing. If the momentum that led to the six-month surge continues, we could see a move towards the near resistance at $4.32 and perhaps challenge the second resistance of $4.95.

However, we must also consider the short-term slip in price. Should the decline deepen, it might test the resilience of the support levels at $2.95 and potentially $2.20, marking a crucial junction for investors. Watching the Simple Moving Average (SMA), which currently hovers around $3.69 for the 10-days, and $3.50 for the 100-days, may provide insight into the price movement. This could indicate whether we're settling for a consolidation phase or if further slide is on the horizon. Balancing the sharp rise in the last half year with recent downward pressure, Optimism's path may see fluctuations, but the long-term possibility of rebounding to previous highs or beyond exists.

The price of Sei has shown a big drop of 12.82% in the past month but looking back six months, it jumped by 566.33%. Now, it sits at $0.81, below the nearest resistance of $1.05 but above the support at $0.60. This suggests that in the near future, the price could go up to test the resistance again, or it might fall to the support levels. If it goes past $1.05, it may go towards the higher resistance at $1.27. But if it slips below $0.60, it could drop to the lower support at $0.36. The 10-day and 100-day averages are $0.88 and $0.70, respectively, showing some stability around the current price.

In the long term, Sei's price has grown a lot since the beginning. The all-time high was $1.14. Considering this, the price has room to grow, and long-term investors might see this as a chance for gains. But, the market can change, and past growth does not always predict the future. Keeping an eye on the price near the closest support and resistance levels gives investors clues about where Sei might go next. If it stays above the 100-day average, this could suggest a strong position, but falling below could mean it's weakening.

Pyth Network's recent month-over-month growth of 56.52% and an impressive six months increase of 137.25% reveal a strong upward trend, despite today's price slightly pulling back to $0.91 from the near resistance level at $0.92. The all-time high of $1.16 suggests there is potential room for growth. If this trend continues, and as it approaches the second resistance level of $1.18, there's optimism for further gains. Long-term, the historical performance could hint at sustained future growth, yet prices may face fluctuations along the way.

However, considering the current indicators with a sell rating from MACD and a sell suggestion for the 10-days Simple Moving Average, it reflects some short-term risks that could lead to a decrease in price. With the nearest support level now at $0.38 and the second support level farther down at $0.1180, a dip below the current price may trigger a downward pressure. For cautious investors, these signs could indicate potential short-term setbacks.

In conclusion, while other cryptocurrencies exhibit potential with varied performance trends and the possibility of price rebounds, BlastUP clearly stands out with its remarkable early achievements. Despite the fluctuations and differing outlooks among competing coins, the comprehensive concept behind BlastUP, coupled with its foundation in the thriving Blast ecosystem, positions it at the forefront of the pack. The project's innovation and dedication to sustaining blockchain startups through an array of tools and incentives highlight its tremendous potential, making it a leading contender for those looking to invest in a crypto asset with high growth prospects. The bottom line is that BlastUP is a name to watch, generating buzz as the cryptocurrency is likely to soar highest amongst its peers.",bitcoinist.com,news,Bitcoinist.com,,0.3568627450980393,448962481,1,https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture83_3baf55.png,eng-9421268

The Indian government's push to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) may lead to large-scale entry of Chinese auto firms in the local market, a report by think tank GTRI said on Sunday. China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has grown rapidly in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

The renewed policy push to make India a hub for e-vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will lead to a sharp increase in dependence on auto component imports from China, the report said.

India's auto component imports were USD 20.3 billion in 2022-23 of which 30% came from China.

As the EVs are getting greater focus in the country, the auto component imports from China may increase further because it has a greater hold over the EV components' global supply chain.

According to estimates, China has 75% of the world's battery production capacity and battery accounts for 40% of the cost of an EV. It also accounts for more than 50% of global EV production and exports.

The report said that in the ""next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on India roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through Joint Venture with Indian firms"".

GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said that Indian market entry provides a much-needed relief to Chinese firms.

""China's EV exports to the European Union and the United States are declining due to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars/EV batteries,"" he said.

JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group, has recently announced an investment of Rs 5,000 crore to enhance production capacity and launch one new car every 3-6 months starting September.

Last year in November, China's largest automaker SAIC Motor inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with the JSW Group to accelerate the transformation and growth of MG Motor in India.

The JV aims to sell one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030 when the total market is expected to be 10 million units annually. MG Motor is a British brand owned by Shanghai-headquartered SAIC Motor.

GTRI said that SAIC Motors is not alone, as other Chinese car companies like BYD Auto have made their mark in India by offering electric vehicles, including buses, trucks, cars, and SUVs.

""Other Chinese companies, including Changan Automobile, Jinko Solar, and several bus and truck manufacturers like Zhongtong Bus and Foton Motor, also contribute to China's automotive presence in India,"" Srivastava said, adding that Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobile are also looking to enter the Indian market, indicating an increasing Chinese influence in India's automotive sector.

He said that China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has rapidly advanced in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components.

As per the report, the automobile industry in India contributes 7.1% to the country's GDP, up from 2.8% in 1992-93. It provides direct and indirect employment to over 19 million individuals.

""The large-scale entry and market dominance of Chinese automakers in India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in EV value chain space, and battery development,"" the report said, adding currently, nearly a quarter of India's auto component imports come from China.

The dependence on China will increase sharply as more Chinese firms making cars in India will import most parts and components from China, it noted.

""China has firm plans to increase its presence in India in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments, after flooding the market with e-rickshaws and two-wheelers,"" it added.

The report suggested that the government and industry stakeholders will need to carefully manage the risks of over-reliance on foreign manufacturers and potential trade imbalances.

""India's decision to allow Chinese car makers in India and cutting import tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) will benefit Chinese manufacturers directly or indirectly being the dominant suppliers of EV batteries. Supply chain dependence on China will sharply increase even when non-Chinese companies (Tesla, Vinfast) set shop in India,"" Srivastava said.

India has recently announced an EV policy. It has announced to cut down import duty on electric vehicles (four-wheelers) from 70-100% to 15% if a foreign company would invest a minimum of USD 500 million in the country in the sector.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.2784313725490195,448962462,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108746677,imgsize-29372,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/industry/indias-push-for-evs-may-lead-to-large-scale-entry-of-chinese-firms-in-domestic-market-gtri.jpg",eng-9418000

A separate report shows Swiss watch exports to China, a leading destination for high-end timepieces, tumbled last month

Fears of a slowdown in spending among Chinese shoppers have dogged the luxury industry for the better part of a year. Last week the scale of the problem hit home for one of fashion’s biggest but most exposed brands, Gucci.

French group Kering SA saw US$9 billion wiped off its market value after warning that sales of the Italian label’s products in China have slumped this quarter. The slowdown is also starting to show up in other corners of the luxury industry.

A separate report showed Swiss watch exports to the country – a leading destination for high-end timepieces – tumbled last month. Analysts, meanwhile, are predicting China’s luxury demand will cool further this year.

The spate of sobering news provides the latest evidence that an anticipated surge in spending by well-heeled Chinese freed from the world’s strictest Covid-19 lockdowns is failing to materialise. While some luxury companies are managing the fallout better than others, the rest could be forced to rethink how they do business in China, starting with Kering.

“I haven’t bought any Gucci bags myself for years,” said Wu Xiaofang, a 34-year-old banker living in Shanghai who was once so enamoured with the brand she bought three bags during a trip to Italy in 2016. “The new designs are bad.”

Wu is among a generation of Chinese luxury shoppers that has grown more selective about where to spend its cash. Rising unemployment and a property downturn have hurt consumer confidence, while deflationary pressures are fuelling concern about growth in one of the world’s largest consumer markets.

The bar to entice Chinese shoppers has therefore risen. Gucci has seen a significant drop in Chinese online sales in recent months, including from its official website and e-commerce platform on Tmall, according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.

Sabato De Sarno, who became Gucci’s creative director last year, has adopted a more minimalist aesthetic than the flamboyant designs of his predecessor, Alessandro Michele. It is too soon to say whether his sleeker and more subdued fashions will resonate with Chinese customers, as they have only recently appeared in stores.

Yet some shoppers may find them less distinctive than before, said fashion consultant Mark Liu, and too similar in style to the likes of Valentino, Prada and Celine. Kering said early ready-to-wear products from the latest Ancora collection by De Sarno have been well received.

Gucci has long been one of the most volatile of the major luxury brands, its fortunes rising and falling based on buzz around designers like Michele and a predecessor, Tom Ford. That makes Kering highly vulnerable to shifts in taste, especially as the Italian brand accounts for about half of its sales and more than two-thirds of profit.

Gucci “seemed to have turned itself into a streetwear brand for a while, then tried to shift back to a high-end brand,” said Wu. “Now I don’t know who it wants to target.”

Kering stunned investors with its March 19 announcement that Gucci sales have fallen nearly 20 per cent this quarter, led by the Asia-Pacific region. The share price fell the most in three decades.

The group started taking action to boost its struggling label two years ago when it named a new fashion head for Gucci in China and Hong Kong. Gucci then parted ways with Michele and hired De Sarno, a lesser-known designer from Valentino. Kering also replaced Marco Bizzarri, who’d headed Gucci for about eight years, with Jean-Francois Palus, a long-time lieutenant of CEO Francois-Henri Pinault.

More changes could be needed to reassure investors.

“Despite Kering’s insistence that Palus is the right interim CEO for Gucci, the market does not agree,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania in a note Friday. “With financial performance deteriorating, the case for appointing a new figurehead with a proven track record would be welcome in our view, as it may enable faster pace of change and new external ideas.”

Kering did not respond to a request for comment.

The slowdown in China is affecting brands aside from Gucci as well, if not as dramatically. While top luxury houses such as Rolex, Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton saw double-digit growth in 2023 in Hong Kong. a popular destination for Chinese shoppers, those sales slowed as early as October, said a person familiar with the matter. Second-hand prices for premium watches plunging 40 per cent in January from the year before.

Few luxury goods are more exposed to changes in Chinese consumer sentiment than Swiss watches. Exports to China plunged by 25 per cent in February from the year before, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said last week, while shipments to Hong Kong dropped by 19 per cent.

Together, exports to those two destinations surpass the US, the biggest single market for Swiss timepieces.

“There is a slowdown,” said Nick Hayek, the chief executive officer of Swatch Group, whose brands include Omega and Tissot. China accounted for a third of the company’s sales in 2023.

Shoppers in China and Hong Kong are visiting Swatch Group brand stores but they are more hesitant to pull the trigger on a major purchase, the CEO said. “They have the money, but they are more critical on when to spend and how to spend it.”

Representatives for Rolex and Chanel declined to comment, while LVMH and Hermes did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The ills are n0t limited to China. After a recent two-week trip to Asia, HSBC luxury analysts led by Erwan Rambourg said in a note Friday that the demand situation in China is “proving tough.” But disappointment also came from lacklustre trends in Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore as Chinese tourists, although coming in greater numbers, don’t seem to be spending much, they wrote.

Some brands may be forced to find ways to reduce their reliance on China. Growth in luxury sales there this year is forecast to slow to the mid-single-digits, compared with 12 per cent in 2023, according to a report from Bain & Company, a consulting firm. But that growth will be driven by high-net-worth individuals, or those with investible assets of more than 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million).

Some luxury labels have bucked the slowing trend. Prada SpA, which owns the brand Miu Miu, saw retail sales rise 32 per cent last quarter in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. Earlier this month, CEO Andrea Guerra said he was satisfied with trends in January and February. Hermes International also saw double-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter.

In uncertain times, Chinese consumers tend to prefer luxury items that are more likely to maintain their value over time, said Bruno Lannes, a co-author of the Bain report. That is why brands with those products fared better than those rolling out seasonal goods, he said.

American cosmetics giant Estee Lauder, which owns labels including La Mer and Tom Ford, is continuing to bet big on China because of its long-term growth prospects and to avoid ceding ground to local upstarts. The volatility will eventually ease as the expansion of the Chinese middle class keeps pushing per capita consumption higher over time.

“That trend is not changing,” CEO Fabrizio Freda said at a UBS conference in New York this month.

Some luxury brands, however, are reconsidering their Asia strategy to look beyond China for future growth, said Angelito Perez Tan, Jnr, co-founder and CEO of RTG Group Asia, which operates businesses including a luxury consultancy. India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East are seen as having great potential in the longer term, he said.

“Executives have looked at it more holistically in terms of that there’s more to Asia than just China,” said Tan. “Luxury brands in general have realised that some of them were too reliant on the Chinese consumer. They realised that they cannot put all their eggs into one basket any more.”",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,-0.1372549019607843,448962456,1,,eng-9421603

The Diplomatic Bluebook for 2024 will also underscore that Tokyo ""cannot afford to waste even a moment"" to solve the long-standing issue of North Korea's past abductions of Japanese nationals as the victims' families continue to age, according to the draft obtained by Kyodo News.

""China has been continuing and intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force"" and ""military activities"" in waters surrounding Japan, including the South and East China seas, the draft paper said.

Such moves by China have put Japan in ""the most severe and complex"" security environment and should be addressed by collaborating with like-minded nations not only its close security ally the United States but also the Philippines, Australia and South Korea, the draft said.

With Beijing's territorial claims and expanding military activities in mind, Japan, the United States and the Philippines have been strengthening security collaboration in recent years.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to meet with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on April 11 in Washington, the first-ever trilateral summit for the countries. They are expected to agree on deeper cooperation.

In the draft police, Japan also urged China to immediately lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood products, which was introduced following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan's disaster-hit Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea that began in August, Kyodo news reported.

As for the abductions by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, Japan renewed its pledge to make efforts in realising the return of all the victims as soon as possible, according to the draft.

On Friday, March 22, Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a substantial net outflow of $51.6 million, while GBTC alone recorded a single-day outflow of $169 million. In contrast, BlackRock's ETF (IBIT) observed minimal net inflows, mitigating some of the negative impact.

Despite Bitcoin's price facing pressure, currently trading at $64,051 with a market cap of $1.259 trillion, analyst Michael van de Poppe sees BlackRock's consistent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs as a positive sign of ongoing institutional buying activity, suggesting the market cycle is far from over.

GBTC's persistent outflows continue to dent the Bitcoin ETF market, with Thursday, March 21, marking another substantial outflow of $359 million, totaling $1.8 billion for the week. Moreover, Bitcoin ETF outflows accelerated, reaching $95 million on March 21 and $261 million on March 20, summing up to $742 million over three days.

While GBTC faced a notable single-day outflow of $386 million on Wednesday, March 20, IBIT saw a significant inflow of $49.28 million, lifting its total historical net inflow to $13.09 billion. However, concerns over central bank actions have led to drying up of ETF inflows this week.

With Bitcoin ETFs experiencing consecutive days of outflows, totaling $326 million on Tuesday, March 19, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Institutional investors seemed cautious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision on March 20, which reflected in subdued inflows across most ETFs.

GBTC's woes persisted with a massive $444 million outflow on Tuesday, exacerbating its losses. On the contrary, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF regained momentum on Monday, March 18, recording $451.5 million inflows, contrasting with minimal inflows for other ETFs.

The event, which began at 8 a.m. and saw the Wajima morning market's characteristic orange tents being erected at the venue near a fishing port in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, drew around 13,000 visitors despite the rain, according to organizers.

Around 30 shops participated in the morning market event, selling products such as seafood and traditional local crafts, with the organizers also providing spaces for visitors to eat.

Mutsumi Michishita, a 57-year-old shop owner, prepared sundried octopus caught off the shores of Wajima just for the event. ""I'm happy to have a place to talk with customers again after such a long time,"" she said.

A 73-year-old woman from Wajima came to the event after being invited by people involved with the market that she had met at her evacuation site in Kaga, southwestern Ishikawa Prefecture.

""The liveliness is nostalgic, and it makes me really want to return (to Wajima),"" she said.

At a ceremony before the event, Nagatake Tomizu, who heads an association supporting the market, vowed to do his best to ""ensure that visitors return home with smiles.""

""It may take time for the market to fully recover, but we appreciate your continued support,"" he said.

Members of the association had been preparing dried seafood and other items for the event since early March. They plan to hold another run in May during the Golden Week holidays and have also received numerous requests from outside the prefecture.

According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, the blaze in Wajima gutted about 49,000 square meters and destroyed around 240 buildings, including residences. The agency surmised the fire spread rapidly due to the high concentration of old wooden buildings in the area.

Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako on Friday made their first visit to the area since the Jan. 1 earthquake to meet with evacuees, during which they also observed a moment of silence in front of the burned rubble where the morning market once stood.",japantoday.com,news,Japan Today,,0.3019607843137255,448962347,1,,

Governor Peter Mbah of Enugu State has pledged to continue disbursing wage awards to state workers until the committee on the new minimum wage completes its deliberations.

This commitment was made during a Town Hall meeting with the people of Enugu held at the Old Government House on Saturday.

Last December, Governor Mbah initiated payments ranging from N10,000 to N25,000 as part of the wage awards to state employees, aiming to mitigate the impact of fuel subsidy removal.

Representatives from various sectors, including civil society organizations, women, students, youth, business owners, traders, and transport unions, attended the town hall meeting.

Governor Mbah assured that his administration would prioritize the welfare of workers and strive to foster an environment conducive to their growth.

""We will continue to distribute wage awards until the conclusion of negotiations on the new minimum wage,"" he affirmed.

Governor Mbah highlighted his administration's efforts to address outstanding pension and gratuity arrears for retired civil servants, emphasizing prompt action to resolve these issues.

""We are currently focused on clearing arrears owed to primary school teachers and Local Government workers,"" he stated.

Governor Mbah underscored its pivotal role in combating poverty in education, announcing plans to establish SMART Schools across all 260 wards by September 2025.

""These SMART Schools will introduce modern teaching methods, incorporating technology such as tablets for students and smart boards for teachers. Our curriculum will also include subjects like artificial intelligence and robotics,"" he explained.

The governor revealed initiatives to enhance healthcare infrastructure, including constructing level two Primary Health Centres across all wards to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates.

""We have already awarded contracts for 30 health centres and plan to award an additional 100,"" he disclosed.

Governor Mbah addressed the electricity issue, outlining efforts to generate and distribute power to households and businesses in the state.

(Captured from Samsung Electronics Executive Vice President Han Jin-man's social media)

The race for leadership in the burgeoning high bandwidth memory chips market is growing fiercer, as Nvidia revealed its plan to secure orders for the cutting-edge component from Samsung Electronics, the Korean chip giant seeking to outsmart crosstown rival SK hynix.

At a media briefing last week, Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, openly endorsed Samsung Electronics and unveiled the company's plan to use the Korean chipmaker's HBM chips in the future. US-based Nvidia is the biggest buyer of advanced HBM chips, which have become a key component for artificial intelligence graphics processing units.

""HBM memory is very complicated and the value added is very high. We are spending a lot of money on HBM,"" Huang said at a media briefing held as part of the company's annual GPU technology conference Tuesday in San Jose, California.

""I am not using Samsung's HBM3E yet. I am currently verifying it,"" he added. ""Samsung is very good, a very good company.""

Huang was also seen visiting Samsung's showroom set up at the GTC event. There he left a short comment of ""Jensen approved"" on the side of Samsung's 12-stack HBM3E, raising speculations that Nvidia is carrying out qualification tests on the latest model. The Nvidia chief did not visit SK hynix's booth.

Over Huang's open endorsement of Samsung, industry officials explained Nvidia would likely want to take a multivendor strategy to reduce the risks of having just one supplier.

""In the buyer's perspective, having only one supplier for a key component in their product would feel unsafe. They would want to work with multiple vendors to secure higher leverage in purchase deals,"" an industry official explained under condition of anonymity.

""(The Nvidia CEO's) mention of Samsung could be interpreted differently, since it means Samsung's product has not yet passed the qualification tests.""

When new memory chips are developed, they go through a qualifying test process to verify their compatibility with the client's product. When a chip is qualified, it means it is ready to start mass production.

HBM chips have come into the spotlight as a novel technology, stacking DRAM chips vertically to increase data processing speed. HBM3 is currently widely used, but chipmakers are introducing the extended version, HBM3E.

SK hynix is expected to be the first supplier to deliver eight-stack HBM3E to Nvidia, as it announced that it has started mass production and plans to supply the advanced chips to Nvidia by the end of this month.",koreaherald.com,news,The Korea Herald,Jo He-rim,0.2470588235294118,448962344,1,https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/03/24/20240324050156_0.jpg?1,

The Indian government's push to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) may lead to large-scale entry of Chinese auto firms in the local market, a report by think tank GTRI said on Sunday.

China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has grown rapidly in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

The renewed policy push to make India a hub for e-vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will lead to a sharp increase in dependence on auto component imports from China, the report said. India's auto component imports were USD 20.3 billion in 2022-23 of which 30 per cent came from China.

As the EVs are getting greater focus in the country, the auto component imports from China may increase further because it has a greater hold over the EV components' global supply chain.

According to estimates, China has 75 per cent of the world's battery production capacity and battery accounts for 40 per cent of the cost of an EV. It also accounts for more than 50 per cent of global EV production and exports.

The report said that in the ""next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on India roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through Joint Venture with Indian firms"". GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said that Indian market entry provides a much-needed relief to Chinese firms.

""China's EV exports to the European Union and the United States are declining due to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars/EV batteries,"" he said.

JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group, has recently announced an investment of Rs 5,000 crore to enhance production capacity and launch one new car every 3-6 months starting September.

Last year in November, China's largest automaker SAIC Motor inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with the JSW Group to accelerate the transformation and growth of MG Motor in India.

The JV aims to sell one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030 when the total market is expected to be 10 million units annually. MG Motor is a British brand owned by Shanghai-headquartered SAIC Motor.

GTRI said that SAIC Motors is not alone, as other Chinese car companies like BYD Auto have made their mark in India by offering electric vehicles, including buses, trucks, cars, and SUVs.

""Other Chinese companies, including Changan Automobile, Jinko Solar, and several bus and truck manufacturers like Zhongtong Bus and Foton Motor, also contribute to China's automotive presence in India,"" Srivastava said, adding that Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobile are also looking to enter the Indian market, indicating an increasing Chinese influence in India's automotive sector.

He said that China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has rapidly advanced in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components.

As per the report, the automobile industry in India contributes 7.1 per cent to the country's GDP, up from 2.8 per cent in 1992-93. It provides direct and indirect employment to over 19 million individuals.

""The large-scale entry and market dominance of Chinese automakers in India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in EV value chain space, and battery development,"" the report said, adding currently, nearly a quarter of India's auto component imports come from China.

The dependence on China will increase sharply as more Chinese firms making cars in India will import most parts and components from China, it noted.

""China has firm plans to increase its presence in India in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments, after flooding the market with e-rickshaws and two-wheelers,"" it added.

The report suggested that the government and industry stakeholders will need to carefully manage the risks of over-reliance on foreign manufacturers and potential trade imbalances.

""India's decision to allow Chinese car makers in India and cutting import tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) will benefit Chinese manufacturers directly or indirectly being the dominant suppliers of EV batteries. Supply chain dependence on China will sharply increase even when non-Chinese companies (Tesla, Vinfast) set shop in India,"" Srivastava said.

India has recently announced an EV policy. It has announced to cut down import duty on electric vehicles (four-wheelers) from 70-100 per cent to 15 per cent if a foreign company would invest a minimum of USD 500 million in the country in the sector.",zeebiz.com,news,Zee Business,,0.3098039215686275,448961988,1,https://cdn.zeebiz.com/sites/default/files/2024/03/24/285312-dojwukrkunp43lx6k4so4frewi-1.jpg,eng-9418000

The altcoins are, in general, also less volatile today, with a few exceptions like Dogecoin, which has surged by around 7%.

BTC Calms

Last business week started on a highly unfavorable note for the primary cryptocurrency, which had recovered most of the losses from the end of the previous one. The asset stood at $69,000 on Monday but quickly dropped by five grand.

Tuesday saw even more declines when BTC slipped to a two-week low of under $61,000. This was primarily driven by profit-taking by certain investors and uncertainty in regard to the upcoming FOMC meeting that took place later that day.

Once the US Federal Reserve said it would not pivot from its current monetary strategy, Bitcoin went on the offensive, jumped by 4% immediately, and soared past $68,000 by Wednesday morning.

Nevertheless, that rally was short-lived, and BTC started losing ground in the next few days. As of now, the cryptocurrency trades at around $64,000 after failing to overcome $66,000 yesterday. Its market cap is flat at $1.260 trillion on CG, and its dominance is just slightly above 49%.

DOGE Goes Up

Most altcoins have also calmed on a daily scale. Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Coin have charted insignificant losses, while XRP, ADA, SHIB, and DOT have jumped by about 1-2%.

In contrast, Dogecoin has emerged as the top performer of the 15 largest crypto assets, having gained 7% overnight. This means that the OG meme coin now sits above $0.17.

Bitcoin Cash, ICP, and OKB are the other impressive gainers, with price increases of up to 8% in the case of OKB.

The total crypto market cap, though, has declined slightly on a daily scale and sits at just over $2.560 trillion on CoinGecko.

""The average age of the buildings at the Flower Market area has exceeded 50 years, and they are inevitably ageing and deteriorating over time. Imagine if these buildings were not systematically rebuilt by the URA but developed independently by different private developers as individual projects. What level of impact would this have on the integrity of the Flower Market?"" he said.

""Shop tenants would not only lack compensation assistance from the URA but also transitional or relocation options. In this scenario, how would the atmosphere and characteristics of the Flower Market be preserved and continued?""

He noted that the URA had conducted a survey of over 100 florists and 700 visitors to the Flower Market before starting the project.

""The survey found that the three major problems faced by flower shop operators are a lack of space to display goods, a lack of loading and unloading areas and a lack of parking spaces.""

In the fast-paced artificial intelligence (AI) world, the quest for fairness has become crucial. The need for equitable and just deployment becomes paramount as AI technologies permeate various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, achieving fairness in AI is no small feat, as researchers, developers, and policymakers grapple with the complexities and nuances inherent in this pursuit.

Fairness in AI is not merely a moral imperative but a foundational element for fostering trust, inclusivity, and responsible technological advancement. Ethically, fairness ensures that AI decisions affecting individuals' lives, such as hiring algorithms, are made without bias or discrimination. Socially, fair AI systems have the potential to mitigate historical biases, promoting inclusivity and diversity. Moreover, embedding fairness in AI aligns with legal frameworks to combat discrimination and uphold equality.

Despite its importance, achieving fairness in AI presents multifaceted challenges. Fairness is inherently subjective and culturally influenced, making it difficult to define and measure objectively. Various definitions of fairness exist, each with mathematical formulations and underlying philosophies, often conflicting. Moreover, fairness encompasses a spectrum of considerations, including equality of opportunity, treatment, and impact, further complicating the matter.

Unintended consequences in AI development

The complexity of fairness in AI is compounded by the myriad of constraints encountered throughout the development process. From computational resources to privacy concerns, these constraints can significantly impact the fairness of AI systems. For instance, computational efficiency requirements may lead to oversimplifications that overlook or misrepresent marginalized groups. Privacy-preserving techniques, while essential, can obscure data necessary for identifying and mitigating biases, disproportionately affecting certain groups.

In a recent study on network pruning, researchers discovered that this method, aimed at reducing the size and speed of machine learning models, can unfairly impact specific demographic groups. Similarly, privacy measures such as adding noise to data to protect privacy can lead to unfair resource allocation, exacerbating existing inequalities. These constraints often intersect, compounding their impact on fairness and necessitating a comprehensive approach to privacy and fairness in AI development.

Continuous improvement and collaboration

Addressing fairness challenges in AI requires a commitment to continuous learning, adaptation, and collaboration. While achieving perfect fairness may be unattainable, striving for continuous improvement is imperative given the pervasiveness of bias in society. Researchers, developers, and users of AI must integrate considerations of fairness into every stage of the AI pipeline, from conception and data collection to algorithm design, deployment, and beyond.

Ensuring fairness in AI is a complex yet essential endeavor. As AI technologies continue to shape our society, we must address biases and inequalities to build trust, promote inclusivity, and uphold ethical standards. By recognizing the challenges, collaborating across disciplines, and committing to continuous improvement, we can strive towards a future where AI serves all members of society equitably and justly.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Brenda Kanana,0.2549019607843137,448960842,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Default_computing_1.jpg,eng-9419058

China's new regulation: Premier Li Qiang of China disclosed plans to implement fresh regulations concerning market access and cross-border data flows during his address to a gathering of global CEOs and Chinese policymakers on Sunday.

In his speech at the China Development Forum in Beijing, Li stressed China's commitment to welcoming companies from across the globe to invest and expand their presence within the nation.

He highlighted China's ambition to nurture emerging sectors such as biological manufacturing while also prioritising advancements in artificial intelligence and the data economy.

The announcement follows Beijing's recent relaxation of certain foreign investment restrictions, a move aimed at bolstering investment inflows following a notable decline in the early months of the year.

Additionally, China's cyberspace regulator has eased some security regulations concerning data exports, addressing concerns raised by foreign companies operating within China.

Premier Li underscored China's relatively low inflation rate and manageable central government debt burden, indicating room for further macro policy adjustments.

He cited previous measures implemented to mitigate property and debt risks, including the issuance of 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in ultra-long special treasury bonds to stimulate investment and stabilise economic growth.

Despite challenges such as a property crisis, local government debt, industrial overcapacity, and cooling foreign investment, China remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering a favourable business environment.

The annual China Development Forum serves as a platform for dialogue between global business leaders and Chinese policymakers, with prominent figures like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio regularly in attendance.

While Premier Li does not have plans for a meeting with foreign CEOs at this year's forum, reports suggest President Xi Jinping intends to meet with a group of U.S. business leaders afterward, signalling China's ongoing efforts to attract foreign investment.

Concerns among overseas firms have arisen following the relaxation of COVID restrictions in 2022, prompting a new action plan aimed at revitalising foreign investment.

The plan seeks to level the playing field for foreign companies, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, telecommunications, and healthcare.

Despite a solid start to the year, analysts view Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ambitious given ongoing challenges such as the property crisis and sluggish household consumption.

It comprises three journal articles and four design proposals in which I have taken an active part. The point of departure for this thesis is the renewed emphasis on social-ecological interaction and resilience that is currently taking place within ecological systems science, and the opportunities that these paradigmatic insights in turn have opened up within urbanism and design. The thesis argues that although they are promising, these emerging integrative frameworks are seldom brought into mainstream planning and urban design practice. Instead, the structuring of ""nature"" and ""city"" into a dualistic balance relationship still permeates not only the general planning discourse, but also makes its way into planning documents, notably influencing distinctions between professions. In response, this thesis sets out to rethink and explore more integrated approaches to human/nature relationships, through the utilization of design-based and transdisciplinary research methods. While this core aim of the thesis remains the same throughout the work, the task is approached from different perspectives: through different constellations of collaborative work as well as through parallel case-based explorations that emphasize the relational, anti-essentialist and situated articulation of values of urban natures and how these forces come into play. The work has been propelled through workshop-based, site-specific, and experimental design processes with professionals and researchers from the fields of e.g. systems ecology, natural resource management, political ecology, urban design, architecture, and landscape design, as well as planners, developers, local interest groups, and NGOs.

Prof. Ezenwaji disclosed this during the commemoration of this year's International Water Day, with the theme ""Water For Peace"".

The event was held at Igwebudu Primary School Urum, Awka North Local Government Area of Anambra State, where a water borehole is to be constructed in conjunction with the Borehole Drillers Association of Nigeria, Anambra State Chapter.

According to him, ""when Nigeria gets the issue of public water supply right, most of the sicknesses will become history.

""This is because seventy percent of the sicknesses are caused by lack of potable water. What we're doing is basic but very important because it is primarily targeted at the school children"".

Professor Ezenwaji while stressing the need for all tiers of government to marshal out sustainability plan for all their water projects, explained that the choice of Igwebudu Primary School, Urum for the borehole project was strategic having existed without water since inception.

""We will hand it over to a committee that will manage, operate and maintain the water. If this is not done, it will not be sustainable. I want the community to take ownership.

""At the Centre, we have discovered that lack of capacity is a gap which must be filled"".

""The theme of the day, 'water for peace' is very apt because when you fall sick as a result of no access to potable water, you will not be at peace even with yourself. You can't go to work or do your business.

""In fact, you are incapacitated. That's why we're here to see that a borehole is sunk here and we provide an elevated tank for seamless hand washing,"" he said.

Prof. Ezenwaji also lauded the state Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo for the ongoing effort to revamp water schemes across the state.

In a remark, the President General of Urum, Mr. Aloysius Tabansi, represented by Chief Dr Damian Iliemenam appreciated the Centre for addressing the greatest challenge confronting the school.

Scientists confirmed 2023 as the hottest year on record; projections suggest this year might be even hotter.

As climate change threatens livability and increases the likelihood of natural disasters, some Aerospace engineers and physicists, including an Israeli researcher, propose a solution: a giant parasol in space to shade the planet.

Prof. Yoram Rozen, director of the Asher Space Research Institute at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, explained that the idea is to design a sunshade and position it strategically between Earth and the sun to block enough solar radiation to mitigate global warming.

The ability to return to pre-Industrial Revolution temperatures

Rozen suggested blocking just 2% of the sun's radiation could cool the planet by 1.5 degrees Celsius, returning us to pre-Industrial Revolution temperatures.

Rozen and his team say scientists already have ""all the pieces needed"" to create such a shade. Therefore, they plan to build a prototype that proves this.

Rozen told The Jerusalem Post that it would take $10 million to $20 million and about three years to build a 10-square-meter prototype. Then, the plan would be to send it into space to a point called ""Lagrange 1"" or ""L1."" Lagrange points are ""positions where the gravitational pull of two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object to move with them,"" NASA explained on its website.

The points are named for Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Rozen explained that a satellite or rocket could launch the prototype into space. Once deployed, the parasol would oscillate between the L1 point and another nearby equilibrium point.

The sail would adjust its angle, alternating between facing the sun directly and being perpendicular to it every three or four months. This movement strategy would maintain satellite stability without requiring a propulsion system. Advertisement

Rozen added that the parasol could be made of any lightweight, weather-resistant fabric, like those blankets given to marathon runners.

The prototype would be a partial solution. According to Rozen, to get the job done, such a shade - or an ensemble of smaller shades - would need to be around 2.5 million square kilometers and something invested in by the whole world, not just the Technion.

Global warming explained

""Why do we have a problem with global warming?"" Rozen asked. ""The sun is heating the air all the time - for billions of years. The Earth has to get rid of the heat, or it will heat and heat endlessly. So, it radiates it out.""

But since the Industrial Revolution, and especially in the last few decades, Rozen explained, an increase in greenhouse gases has impeded heat loss from Earth's atmosphere to space.

""Now, temperatures are 1.2 to 1.3 degrees higher than we want them to be, and the result is what we see happening with our weather,"" Rozen said. ""We want the temperatures to go back a bit.

""Even if we completely stop emissions - let's say there is not a single car on the road, no flights, no cows - we will stay at the current temperature, which is pretty bad,"" Rozen continued. ""We don't think making a sunshade will be too difficult. We think we have a solution.""

Rozen and his team are just some of the scientists who have proposed sunshade solutions. In 2021, for example, Swedish scientists published a paper titled ""Realistic Sunshade System at L1 for Global Temperature Control,"" suggesting that sunshades could be constructed on Earth using future solar sail technology and reach the L1 point within two years through solar sailing. They estimated the cost to be a few trillion dollars.

There was also a similar suggestion by American researcher Robert Angel in 2006, who wrote the ""Feasibility of cooling the Earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near the inner Lagrange point (L1).""

There is even a foundation called the Planetary Society focused on how to shade the Earth, which has also examined the possibility of space parasols.

However, scientists at Wichita State University recently pushed back on the idea.

""You hear a lot of big-name people talking about some ideas, like, 'Let's have a space shield to block out some of the sun -- cool the planet with some shadows,'"" said Dr. Nickolas Solomey in an article published over the weekend on the Wichita State University website. ""From a science point of view, there are some questions.""

Working with graduate student Kelly Kabler, Solomey calculated that to cool the Earth by 1.5 degrees Celsius, a 10% to 15% reduction in sunlight would be necessary. Rozen's shade would only reduce sunlight by around 2%.

Kabler calculated that the shade would need to be around 900 miles wide and would take between 12 and 15 years to achieve its goal -- and the effects of the shade would only last as much as 60 years.

The Kansas research will be presented next month at the Innovation in Climate Resilience conference in Washington.

""The final answer was that [a sunshade] is not totally plausible as the sole mechanism for slowing down climate change. There would have to be other things that come into play to help with it,"" Kabler said. ""It's not very practical.""

The Indian government's push to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) may lead to large-scale entry of Chinese auto firms in the local market, a report by think tank GTRI said on Sunday. China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has grown rapidly in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

The renewed policy push to make India a hub for e-vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will lead to a sharp increase in dependence on auto component imports from China, the report said.

India's auto component imports were USD 20.3 billion in 2022-23 of which 30 per cent came from China.

As the EVs are getting greater focus in the country, the auto component imports from China may increase further because it has a greater hold over the EV components' global supply chain.

According to estimates, China has 75 per cent of the world's battery production capacity and battery accounts for 40 per cent of the cost of an EV. It also accounts for more than 50 per cent of global EV production and exports.

The report said that in the ""next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on India roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through Joint Venture with Indian firms"".

GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said that Indian market entry provides a much-needed relief to Chinese firms.

""China's EV exports to the European Union and the United States are declining due to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars/EV batteries,"" he said.

JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group, has recently announced an investment of Rs 5,000 crore to enhance production capacity and launch one new car every 3-6 months starting September.

Last year in November, China's largest automaker SAIC Motor inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with the JSW Group to accelerate the transformation and growth of MG Motor in India.

The JV aims to sell one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030 when the total market is expected to be 10 million units annually. MG Motor is a British brand owned by Shanghai-headquartered SAIC Motor.

GTRI said that SAIC Motors is not alone, as other Chinese car companies like BYD Auto have made their mark in India by offering electric vehicles, including buses, trucks, cars, and SUVs.

""Other Chinese companies, including Changan Automobile, Jinko Solar, and several bus and truck manufacturers like Zhongtong Bus and Foton Motor, also contribute to China's automotive presence in India,"" Srivastava said, adding that Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobile are also looking to enter the Indian market, indicating an increasing Chinese influence in India's automotive sector.

He said that China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has rapidly advanced in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components.

As per the report, the automobile industry in India contributes 7.1 per cent to the country's GDP, up from 2.8 per cent in 1992-93. It provides direct and indirect employment to over 19 million individuals.

""The large-scale entry and market dominance of Chinese automakers in India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in EV value chain space, and battery development,"" the report said, adding currently, nearly a quarter of India's auto component imports come from China.

The dependence on China will increase sharply as more Chinese firms making cars in India will import most parts and components from China, it noted.

""China has firm plans to increase its presence in India in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments, after flooding the market with e-rickshaws and two-wheelers,"" it added.

The report suggested that the government and industry stakeholders will need to carefully manage the risks of over-reliance on foreign manufacturers and potential trade imbalances.

""India's decision to allow Chinese car makers in India and cutting import tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) will benefit Chinese manufacturers directly or indirectly being the dominant suppliers of EV batteries. Supply chain dependence on China will sharply increase even when non-Chinese companies (Tesla, Vinfast) set shop in India,"" Srivastava said.

India has recently announced an EV policy. It has announced to cut down import duty on electric vehicles (four-wheelers) from 70-100 per cent to 15 per cent if a foreign company would invest a minimum of USD 500 million in the country in the sector.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.3411764705882352,448960261,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108746021,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-29372,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",eng-9418000

China may expand far faster than the current quo with a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva's statement on Sunday.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding $3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum, calling for steps to improve the sustainability of the property sector, reduce debt risks and focus more on domestic consumption.

According to her, taking firm action to lower the supply of unfinished houses and create greater room for market-based corrections in the real estate sector might hasten the resolution of present issues in the industry and increase investor and consumer confidence.

China will continue to optimise its property policies, Premier Li Qiang said on Friday in his most recent public statements about the housing industry. Li stated earlier this month that he wanted to grow the company by about 5% annually, which some analysts thought was a lofty objective.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilize economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

This excess in storage, coupled with a decline in gas production, influenced the market. The reduction in output, about 4% over the past month, was driven by reduced drilling activities from major firms like EQT and Chesapeake Energy. Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. gas rig count had dropped to its lowest since January 2022, reflecting this decrease in production.

Supply and Demand Trends

LSEG data showed a drop in gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states to 100.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, down from 104.1 bcfd in February. However, gas demand, including exports, is expected to rise in the short term with cooler weather, before decreasing as conditions become milder. Gas flows to major U.S. LNG export plants also decreased, further influencing market dynamics.

Natural Gas Producers' Outlook Amid Low Prices

Despite the current low prices, energy executives remain optimistic about the future of LNG. They anticipate a surge in demand from new LNG plants, which could balance the market and increase prices. However, concerns about oversupply, infrastructure constraints, and the evolving energy landscape pose challenges. There's a growing focus on renewable energy sources, yet the growing energy demands from sectors like AI and digital technologies could bolster natural gas usage.

Weekly Forecast

Considering the recent trends in storage levels, production cutbacks, and fluctuating demand, the natural gas market appears to be in a state of flux. The short-term outlook suggests a bearish trend due to the current oversupply and reduced export capacities. However, the potential increase in demand from cooler weather and the longer-term prospects of new LNG facilities could gradually stabilize and uplift the market. In the coming week, prices are expected to remain under pressure, reflecting these mixed influences.",fxempire.com,news,FXEmpire.com,James Hyerczyk,0.04313725490196085,448959929,1,https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/03/Natural-Gas-Industry-5.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700,eng-9421715

China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has grown rapidly in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

The renewed policy push to make India a hub for e-vehicle manufacturing and efforts of the private sector will lead to a sharp increase in dependence on auto component imports from China, the report said.

India's auto component imports were USD 20.3 billion in 2022-23 of which 30 per cent came from China.

As the EVs are getting greater focus in the country, the auto component imports from China may increase further because it has a greater hold over the EV components' global supply chain.

According to estimates, China has 75 per cent of the world's battery production capacity and battery accounts for 40 per cent of the cost of an EV. It also accounts for more than 50 per cent of global EV production and exports.

The report said that in the ''next few years, every third electric vehicle and many passenger and commercial vehicles on India roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through Joint Venture with Indian firms''.

GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said that Indian market entry provides a much-needed relief to Chinese firms.

''China's EV exports to the European Union and the United States are declining due to anti-subsidy probes and increased trade restrictions over the export of subsidised cars/EV batteries,'' he said.

JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between China's SAIC and Indian conglomerate JSW Group, has recently announced an investment of Rs 5,000 crore to enhance production capacity and launch one new car every 3-6 months starting September.

Last year in November, China's largest automaker SAIC Motor inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with the JSW Group to accelerate the transformation and growth of MG Motor in India.

The JV aims to sell one million units of passenger electric vehicles in India by 2030 when the total market is expected to be 10 million units annually. MG Motor is a British brand owned by Shanghai-headquartered SAIC Motor.

GTRI said that SAIC Motors is not alone, as other Chinese car companies like BYD Auto have made their mark in India by offering electric vehicles, including buses, trucks, cars, and SUVs.

''Other Chinese companies, including Changan Automobile, Jinko Solar, and several bus and truck manufacturers like Zhongtong Bus and Foton Motor, also contribute to China's automotive presence in India,'' Srivastava said, adding that Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobile are also looking to enter the Indian market, indicating an increasing Chinese influence in India's automotive sector.

He said that China's automotive industry, buoyed by substantial state support, has rapidly advanced in electric vehicle technology, making it a leading exporter of EVs and related components.

As per the report, the automobile industry in India contributes 7.1 per cent to the country's GDP, up from 2.8 per cent in 1992-93. It provides direct and indirect employment to over 19 million individuals.

''The large-scale entry and market dominance of Chinese automakers in India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in EV value chain space, and battery development,'' the report said, adding currently, nearly a quarter of India's auto component imports come from China. The dependence on China will increase sharply as more Chinese firms making cars in India will import most parts and components from China, it noted.

''China has firm plans to increase its presence in India in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments, after flooding the market with e-rickshaws and two-wheelers,'' it added.

The report suggested that the government and industry stakeholders will need to carefully manage the risks of over-reliance on foreign manufacturers and potential trade imbalances.

''India's decision to allow Chinese car makers in India and cutting import tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) will benefit Chinese manufacturers directly or indirectly being the dominant suppliers of EV batteries. Supply chain dependence on China will sharply increase even when non-Chinese companies (Tesla, Vinfast) set shop in India,'' Srivastava said.

India has recently announced an EV policy. It has announced to cut down import duty on electric vehicles (four-wheelers) from 70-100 per cent to 15 per cent if a foreign company would invest a minimum of USD 500 million in the country in the sector.

Hanoi (VNA) - Vietnam's ambition to elevate its stock market from ""frontier"" to ""emerging"" status by 2025 faces two key hurdles, including pre-trade margin requirements for foreign investors and foreign ownership ratios in certain sectors, said Deputy Director of the Securities Market Development Department under the State Securities Commission (SSC) Pham Thi Thuy Linh.

Despite successfully meeting 7 out of the 9 established criteria for the upgrade, the two other requirements remain considerable roadblocks.

To tackle the pre-trade margin requirement challenge, Linh revealed ongoing discussions with international rating agencies are being conducted to seek viable solutions. Additionally, the SSC has proposed regulatory amendments and supplements to the Ministry of Finance (MoF). These revisions, if implemented, would eliminate the need for a 100% cash margin requirement for foreign institutional investors, provided they can demonstrate a secure payment process.

Regarding the foreign ownership ratios, the SSC is collaborating with the MoF and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to conduct a comprehensive review across various industries. The SSC has proposed that the MPI work alongside other relevant ministries and agencies to expand foreign ownership limits in non-essential sectors. This critical information, translated into English, is expected to be publicly available soon.

The SSC is also making efforts to improve information disclosure regulations, specifically for public and large-scale listed companies. The proposed amendments, once approved by the MoF, would mandate English disclosure for both regular and irregular information updates. The implementation timeline for these changes would see English disclosures become mandatory for regular information and large-scale company listings starting January 1, 2025. Irregular information disclosures would follow suit by January 1, 2026, with the requirement encompassing all public companies by January 1, 2028.

The Diplomatic Bluebook for 2024 will also underscore that Tokyo ""cannot afford to waste even a moment"" to solve the long-standing issue of North Korea's past abductions of Japanese nationals as the victims' families continue to age, according to the draft obtained by Kyodo News.

""China has been continuing and intensifying its attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force"" and ""military activities"" in waters surrounding Japan, including the South and East China seas, the draft paper said.

Such moves by China have put Japan in ""the most severe and complex"" security environment and should be addressed by collaborating with like-minded nations not only its close security ally the United States but also the Philippines, Australia and South Korea, the draft said.

With Beijing's territorial claims and expanding military activities in mind, Japan, the United States and the Philippines have been strengthening security collaboration in recent years.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to meet with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on April 11 in Washington, the first-ever trilateral summit for the countries. They are expected to agree on deeper cooperation.

In the draft police, Japan also urged China to immediately lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood products, which was introduced following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan's disaster-hit Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea that began in August, Kyodo news reported.

Asked about the Chattogram development co-ordination meeting, Dr Hasan said there was a detail discussion on the drainage project and ""we have given importance to the coordination of the drainage project.""

Hasan said, ""We also discussed the importance of regular maintenance of this project as two and a half years are left for the completion of the project.""

The foreign minister said that the Chattogram Port Authority has informed that the Prime Minister has already handed over five hundred acres of land to the Chattogram Port Authority free of cost for the Bay-Terminal.

""They will get more three hundred acres of land, for which the port authority has applied. Chattogram Port has already signed MoU with DP World and Singapore Port Authority,"" the minister added.

The need for equitable and just deployment becomes paramount as AI technologies permeate various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, achieving fairness in AI is no small feat, as researchers, developers, and policymakers grapple with the complexities and nuances inherent in this pursuit.

Fairness in AI is not merely a moral imperative but a foundational element for fostering trust, inclusivity, and responsible technological advancement. Ethically, fairness ensures that AI decisions affecting individuals' lives, such as hiring algorithms, are made without bias or discrimination. Socially, fair AI systems have the potential to mitigate historical biases, promoting inclusivity and diversity. Moreover, embedding fairness in AI aligns with legal frameworks to combat discrimination and uphold equality.

Despite its importance, achieving fairness in AI presents multifaceted challenges. Fairness is inherently subjective and culturally influenced, making it difficult to define and measure objectively. Various definitions of fairness exist, each with mathematical formulations and underlying philosophies, often conflicting. Moreover, fairness encompasses a spectrum of considerations, including equality of opportunity, treatment, and impact, further complicating the matter.

Unintended consequences in AI development

The complexity of fairness in AI is compounded by the myriad of constraints encountered throughout the development process. From computational resources to privacy concerns, these constraints can significantly impact the fairness of AI systems. For instance, computational efficiency requirements may lead to oversimplifications that overlook or misrepresent marginalized groups. Privacy-preserving techniques, while essential, can obscure data necessary for identifying and mitigating biases, disproportionately affecting certain groups.

In a recent study on network pruning, researchers discovered that this method, aimed at reducing the size and speed of machine learning models, can unfairly impact specific demographic groups. Similarly, privacy measures such as adding noise to data to protect privacy can lead to unfair resource allocation, exacerbating existing inequalities. These constraints often intersect, compounding their impact on fairness and necessitating a comprehensive approach to privacy and fairness in AI development.

Continuous improvement and collaboration

Addressing fairness challenges in AI requires a commitment to continuous learning, adaptation, and collaboration. While achieving perfect fairness may be unattainable, striving for continuous improvement is imperative given the pervasiveness of bias in society. Researchers, developers, and users of AI must integrate considerations of fairness into every stage of the AI pipeline, from conception and data collection to algorithm design, deployment, and beyond.

Ensuring fairness in AI is a complex yet essential endeavor. As AI technologies continue to shape our society, we must address biases and inequalities to build trust, promote inclusivity, and uphold ethical standards. By recognizing the challenges, collaborating across disciplines, and committing to continuous improvement, we can strive towards a future where AI serves all members of society equitably and justly.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1372549019607843,448958768,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9419058

From soil analysis to post-harvesting techniques, the tools play a pivotal role in every phase of agricultural production.

At the heart of agricultural success lies the soil. Understanding its composition and health is paramount for farmers who wish to maximize their yields. Modern soil analysis tools empower farmers to assess nutrient levels, pH balance, and potential contaminants, thus allowing for precise and targeted interventions, said Dr Alamgir Khan, Coordinator Faculty of Biosystem, Engineering and Technology, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture.

He said, ""With this knowledge, farmers can effectively manage the fertilization and irrigation practices for crops' growth"". Mechanized plows, seed drills, and cultivators streamline the process with minimum time and effort, Dr Khan stated.

From precision irrigation systems to crop monitoring drones, modern technologies benefit farmers in managing their fields with precision and foresight. Real-time data on moisture levels, pest infestations, and crop health enable proactive decision-making, mitigating risks and optimizing resource allocation, said Khan. ""One key aspect is the deficiency of organic matter within Pakistani soil, standing at a mere 0.5 percent compared to over 6.5 percent in high-yield countries"", he added.

Dr. Khan also pointed out the lack of designated traffic zones for heavy machinery in Pakistani fields, leading to soil compaction and structural damage that hinders crop growth. The developed countries have special traffic zones for movement of tractors and other heavy machinery on the soil, he informed. He also underscored the significance of proper plowing techniques, concerning the prevalent practice of crop residue burning, which kills beneficial microorganisms.

Dr. Khan advocated for the adoption of modern plowing tools, citing innovations like the windrow turner developed by Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture Multan (MNSUAM), which facilitates composting on a large scale, converting farm waste into valuable resources.

Investment in the compost market, Dr. Khan suggested, could be lucrative, with the global market potentially reaching five to seven billion Dollars. He also stressed the importance of soil moisture retention and advocated for the use of rippers to break hardpan soil layers as it enabled better water absorption.

The agriculture scientist also reported a global decline in phosphorus reservoirs and also attributed it to the increasing prices of DAP fertilizers. He proposed utilizing animal manure as a phosphorus source through modern agricultural machinery.

However, acknowledging the significance of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems, Dr.

Khan maintained that healthy soil preparation according to modern standards not only conserves water but also contributes to bumper crop yield. He also highlighted the potential of drone sprayers and modern fertilizer application techniques in resource conservation which ultimately led to profit generating farming.

Similarly, he stated, ""the post-harvesting tools play a crucial role in preserving the quality and quantity of agricultural produce. Efficient harvesting machinery reduces losses and ensures timely collection while minimizing waste and multiplying the profits.

Similarly, the modern storage facilities equipped with temperature and humidity control mechanisms prolong the shelf life of perishable crops and facilitate market access, he remarked. To a query, he stated that the world was moving towards nano-technology, nano-fertilizers and some other modern practices to achieve goals of food security.

Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ateel stated ""Although agriculture tools are very important but we cannot term all tools as essential for bumper produce. He added that sometimes heavy machinery conveyed loss.

""We need to promote such modern tools which work with precision and offer more profit"", Saqib maintained. Efficient machines at all stages of crop growth, right from soil preparation to post harvest management, must be utilized amicably.

In traditional farming practices, farmers waste 70 percent of pesticides, and fertilizers, however, they could avoid by utilizing modern spray tools. Now, drones are the latest tools for spray.

These contain sensors and manage spray at affected areas only, said Saqib. Similarly, there emerged some more latest but efficient tools which harvest only the ripe fruits, etc. Apart from this, there were some machines also available for accurate and precise use of fertilizers.

When fertilizers used traditionally, about 70 percent could not yield the required results. However, the latest machines are the solution to our different agricultural problems.

Saqib Ateel also suggested prioritizing investment in these transformative technologies for sustainable agriculture.

The role of machinery cannot be denied, he said, adding that a huge portion of peasants lacked access to machinery due to limited sources. He stated that the government should come forward and provide machinery to small farmers through reverse engineering.

Agriculture department officials Abdul Samad and Rrashid Sidhu, while commenting on farm mechanization, stated that the Punjab government was offering subsidies on 56 agri-tools of different nature to facilitate the farming community.",urdupoint.com,news,UrduPoint,Fahad Shabbir,0.2705882352941176,448958688,1,https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png,eng-9421260

Naira Gains Strength In Parallel Market, Trading At N1,470 Per Dollar

The Nigerian naira experienced a notable appreciation in the parallel foreign exchange market on Friday, trading at N1,470 per dollar, marking a 2 percent increase from the N1,500 rate on March 20.

Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in Lagos, the country's commercial hub, have set the buying rate of the American currency at N1,430 and the selling rate at N1,470, yielding a profit margin of N40.

According to conversations with currency traders by TheCable, the naira's recent surge in value has led to a decline in customer demand.

The traders attributed the reduced patronage to the strengthened local currency, which has lessened the frantic rush for dollars that typically characterizes the parallel market.

The steel industry employs tens of thousands of people in central and eastern Europe, Fábián said, and cited the head of the European Steel Association as saying that every direct steel industry job adds seven more indirect jobs on the industry value chain.

The state secretary said that after Friday's meeting it had become clear to the EC as well that more resources were needed to make the steel industry greener, and that these programmes needed to be streamlined so that they are easier for stakeholders to access.

The viral infection was passed from a patient to a doctor, but the doctor's symptoms have improved, the NIID said earlier this week.

The doctor, a man in his 20s, attended to a patient in his 90s who had been diagnosed with SFTS after visiting the emergency room last April due to deteriorating health, the institute said.

The doctor performed various procedures on the patient who later died, including removing his catheter post-mortem, during which the doctor reportedly wore a face mask and gloves but no goggles.

Approximately nine days after the patient's death, the doctor developed symptoms of fever and headache, and was diagnosed with SFTS upon medical examination, it added.

Fliteboard, a leading player in the eFoil industry, has just unveiled its thrilling 2024 product lineup, promising to take water adventures to soar new heights.

We took a couple of Fliteboards out for a spin last year, and it's safe to say we were hooked from the moment the eFoil left the water to hover over the sea like a magic carpet. As such, we're super excited about the brand's new models.

In case you're unfamiliar, eFoils are like surf boards on steroids. Using an underwater motor unit and handheld controller, these puppies let you ride the waves effortlessly.

The latest offerings from Fliteboard include the fourth-generation Fliteboard and Fliteboard PRO, boasting exciting new features like a high-performance Aluminium eFoil propulsion system with a titanium conical wing interface.

The new board also has a Marc Newson-designed hand controller sporting a larger, brighter colour screen.

Also making a splash is the durable Soft Top EVA board range, designed for extra resilience.

A brand new addition to the range is the ULTRA L2, hailed as the world's lightest production performance eFoil, tailored for the most skilled riders out there.

Weighing in at a mere 40 pounds, it's light as a feather and comes packed with a carbon fibre mast, a wave tracking feature, and a sleek design for ultimate manoeuvrability.

According to David Trewern, the CEO and Founder of Fliteboard, ""Every year since we announced the original Fliteboard in 2017, we've brought new, industry-leading innovations to the world.""

And 2024 is no exception, as the latest Flite range promises something for everyone, from beginners to pros, at accessible and premium price points. Of course, 'accessible pricing' means different when it comes to eFoils - an average model sells for $4,500.

That said, there are cheaper boards available, and the Fliteboard community continues to grow at a rapid rate, as nearly 11,000 Fliteboards have been sold in over 90 countries. There is clearly a market for eFoils!

This statement was made by Rafael Frankel, director of Public Policy for Southeast and South Asia at Meta Group, at a recent press conference announcing the Vietnam Innovation Challenge (VIC) 2024.

He said there are many reasons why he remains optimistic and believes that the nation will turn into a ""dragon"" in AI.

The Meta Group representative said that the first time he came to the country was 23 years ago. Since then, the Vietnamese economic picture has changed markedly and the nation's economic growth over the past generation can be seen as being very strong.

People have great determination and have shown a start-up spirit, while many businesses have become trusted partners of US firms, he added.

Frankel said he will continue to support Vietnamese enterprises in developing innovation, as well as promoting AI and semiconductors, thereby enabling them to become partners of US businesses.

According to Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Duy Dong, alongside the development of AI technology, the country has also taken strong steps in promoting AI research, application, and human resource development.

In 2021, the Vietnamese Government issued the National Strategy on AI research, development, and application until 2030.

After two years of implementation, the country has achieved encouraging achievements, noting that in 2022 it ranked 55th out of 180 countries and territories in the AI readiness index, up seven places compared to 2021, according to a report by Oxford Insights.

The nation also has businesses that have recorded significant achievements in research and application of AI, such as FPT, Viettel AI, VNPT AI, and VIN AI. This further proves the capacity and position of engineers and Vietnamese experts in research and development of AI technology applications, Deputy Minister Dong stated.

Vu Duy Thuc, co-founder of New Turing Institute & VietAI, underlined the need to determine the specific value that AI brings in order to fully consider developing products which have superior features for users.

Meanwhile, Phung Viet Thang, country director of Intel Vietnam, said that with Vietnamese advantages, making the best use off semiconductor and AI technology needs a clear strategy and support from the Government.

Encouraging innovation and development in all high-tech, semiconductor, and AI industries will therefore create plenty of opportunities for local businesses as the country has the advantage of abundant resources and readiness.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20 per cent in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan (RM655 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's US$18 trillion (RM85 trillion) economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of US business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict Covid curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5 per cent as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market. -- Reuters",malaymail.com,news,Malay Mail,,0.1372549019607843,448957891,1,https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/400x400/197019.jpg,eng-9416958

However, a significant portion of farmers are still facing limited access to modern agricultural tools, which are indispensable for achieving bumper crop yields. From soil analysis to post-harvesting techniques, the tools play a pivotal role in every phase of agricultural production.

At the heart of agricultural success lies the soil. Understanding its composition and health is paramount for farmers who wish to maximize their yields. Modern soil analysis tools empower farmers to assess nutrient levels, pH balance, and potential contaminants, thus allowing for precise and targeted interventions, said Dr Alamgir Khan, Coordinator Faculty of Biosystem, Engineering and Technology, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture.

He said, ""With this knowledge, farmers can effectively manage the fertilization and irrigation practices for crops' growth"". Mechanized plows, seed drills, and cultivators streamline the process with minimum time and effort, Dr Khan stated.

From precision irrigation systems to crop monitoring drones, modern technologies benefit farmers in managing their fields with precision and foresight. Real-time data on moisture levels, pest infestations, and crop health enable proactive decision-making, mitigating risks and optimizing resource allocation, said Khan. ""One key aspect is the deficiency of organic matter within Pakistani soil, standing at a mere 0.5 percent compared to over 6.5 percent in high-yield countries"", he added.

Dr. Khan also pointed out the lack of designated traffic zones for heavy machinery in Pakistani fields, leading to soil compaction and structural damage that hinders crop growth. The developed countries have special traffic zones for movement of tractors and other heavy machinery on the soil, he informed. He also underscored the significance of proper plowing techniques, concerning the prevalent practice of crop residue burning, which kills beneficial microorganisms.

Dr. Khan advocated for the adoption of modern plowing tools, citing innovations like the windrow turner developed by Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture Multan (MNSUAM), which facilitates composting on a large scale, converting farm waste into valuable resources.

Investment in the compost market, Dr. Khan suggested, could be lucrative, with the global market potentially reaching five to seven billion dollars. He also stressed the importance of soil moisture retention and advocated for the use of rippers to break hardpan soil layers as it enabled better water absorption.

The agriculture scientist also reported a global decline in phosphorus reservoirs and also attributed it to the increasing prices of DAP fertilizers. He proposed utilizing animal manure as a phosphorus source through modern agricultural machinery.

However, acknowledging the significance of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems, Dr. Khan maintained that healthy soil preparation according to modern standards not only conserves water but also contributes to bumper crop yield. He also highlighted the potential of drone sprayers and modern fertilizer application techniques in resource conservation which ultimately led to profit generating farming.

Similarly, he stated, ""the post-harvesting tools play a crucial role in preserving the quality and quantity of agricultural produce. Efficient harvesting machinery reduces losses and ensures timely collection while minimizing waste and multiplying the profits.

Similarly, the modern storage facilities equipped with temperature and humidity control mechanisms prolong the shelf life of perishable crops and facilitate market access, he remarked. To a query, he stated that the world was moving towards nano-technology, nano-fertilizers and some other modern practices to achieve goals of food security.

Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ateel stated ""Although agriculture tools are very important but we cannot term all tools as essential for bumper produce. He added that sometimes heavy machinery conveyed loss.

""We need to promote such modern tools which work with precision and offer more profit"", Saqib maintained. Efficient machines at all stages of crop growth, right from soil preparation to post harvest management, must be utilized amicably.

In traditional farming practices, farmers waste 70 percent of pesticides, and fertilizers, however, they could avoid by utilizing modern spray tools. Now, drones are the latest tools for spray.

These contain sensors and manage spray at affected areas only, said Saqib. Similarly, there emerged some more latest but efficient tools which harvest only the ripe fruits, etc. Apart from this, there were some machines also available for accurate and precise use of fertilizers.

When fertilizers used traditionally, about 70 percent could not yield the required results. However, the latest machines are the solution to our different agricultural problems.

Saqib Ateel also suggested prioritizing investment in these transformative technologies for sustainable agriculture.

Shahid Hameed Bhutta, the known mango grower, also shared his experiences and stated that machinery was essential for smart agriculture practices and gaining more production.

Similarly, there is a dearth of labor in the agriculture field.

The role of machinery cannot be denied, he said, adding that a huge portion of peasants lacked access to machinery due to limited sources. He stated that the government should come forward and provide machinery to small farmers through reverse engineering.

Agriculture department officials Abdul Samad and Rrashid Sidhu, while commenting on farm mechanization, stated that the Punjab government was offering subsidies on 56 agri-tools of different nature to facilitate the farming community.",app.com.pk,news,Associated Press Of Pakistan,Nnps Desk,0.3411764705882352,448957642,1,https://www.app.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fall-Back-Image-2.png,eng-9421260

Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of €211m and statutory earnings per share of €1.54. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

See our latest analysis for init innovation in traffic systems

After the latest results, the twin analysts covering init innovation in traffic systems are now predicting revenues of €254.3m in 2024. If met, this would reflect a major 21% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 13% to €1.74. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €246.8m and earnings per share (EPS) of €1.89 in 2024. Overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest results. Although there was a a major to revenue, the consensus also made a small dip in its earnings per share forecasts.

Curiously, the consensus price target rose 5.8% to €50.25. We can only conclude that the forecast revenue growth is expected to offset the impact of the expected fall in earnings.

One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that init innovation in traffic systems' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 21% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 6.9% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.4% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that init innovation in traffic systems is expected to grow much faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.

Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have analyst estimates for init innovation in traffic systems going out as far as 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

Take Gurgaon-based Paracoat Products, which makes parts that dampen noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) in automobiles. Typically, such parts are made of plastic or wood. Now, the company is experimenting with jute sticks.

Even as India surges ahead in the adoption of clean-energy vehicles, a quiet recycling revolution is happening in parallel, complementing the race to a greener future. The world's third largest automaker is taking the first steps towards reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products.

Corporate-run scrap yards are coming up, creating a new industry of sorts of recyclable parts, while component manufacturers are replacing metal and plastic with innovative biodegradable material. Take Gurgaon-based Paracoat Products, which makes parts that dampen noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) in automobiles. Typically, such parts are made of plastic or wood. Now, the company is experimenting with jute sticks. Navin Banka, COO of Paracoat, says as the transition to electric mobility kicked in three years ago, automakers and their part suppliers were forced to look at alternative materials that could lead to a reduction in NVH and the overall weight of vehicles.

""That is when we started using agro waste like jute sticks, which are either discarded or burnt,"" he says. The new material was on display at the Bharat Mobility Expo in Delhi recently.

THE AFTERLIFE

Alongside small initiatives like Paracoat's at the components level, there is some momentum at aggregate level as well, with the establishment of scrapping centres for end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). In September 2021, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) came up with rules for registered vehicle scrapping facilities (RVSF) to promote a legally compliant vehicle-dismantling and -scrapping industry. Over 50 RVSFs are now operational in various states and 60-70 more will be coming up in the next five years, with an estimated investment of '10,000 crore, according to Nomura Research Institute.

In a country where 3.2 million new vehicles, on average, are sold every year, the importance of creating an ecosystem -- for scrapping old vehicles in an organised manner and recycling them with maximum extraction of material to minimise waste -- cannot be understated. It is also critical for import substitution. Nomura estimates India will have more than 22 million ELVs by 2025, which translates into a potential scrap value of '32,700 crore. These scrapping centres -- which are established either by automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki or independent companies -- have received a slow response so far, says Kartick Nagpal, president, Rosmerta Recycling. Even as sustainability has become a buzz word across the value chain, it has been a slow start to vehicle scrapping.

Most RVSFs, including the one set up by Rosmerta, are grossly underutilised. Rosmerta's 70,000 sq ft facility in Haryana's Manesar -- the largest in north India -- has the capacity to scrap 28,000 vehicles a year. Though Rosmerta's RSVF is doubling production every quarter -- from 155 tonnes in Q1 FY24 to an estimated 1,200 tonnes by the end of Q4 -- it has utilised only 15% of its capacity. That has not dissuaded Nagpal. His firm is looking to launch one unit each in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat in the current fiscal. ""We are confident that this will pick up in two-three years once vehicle owners have better clarity,"" says Nagpal, who adds that most owners either hesitate to scrap their vehicles or go to unauthorised centres that give them a better value.

BEYOND METAL

The use of alternative materials will go up multiple times when India's vehicle scrappage policy becomes mandatory, says Banka of Paracoat.

Metals constitute 86% of total material in an ELV while plastics, glass and rubber constitute 9%. About 5% are non-recyclable, disposable items, according to Nomura Research. With its jute sticks, Paracoat has been able to bring down weight by 12- 15%. ""It is helping everyone. These parts are recyclable, it will reduce our dependence on virgin plastics and will also help the farming community,"" says Banka.

The share of agricultural waste in the company's raw material basket is only 1-1.5%. But Banka expects this to climb to 10% in the next couple of years as carmakers step up the use of alternative materials in their forthcoming models. Banka claims his firm is the only one to have commercialised composites made from agricultural waste: jute sticks are powdered or granulated and then mixed with various additives and polymers.

This agro-based composite is then used for moulding components for sheeting, calendaring, etc, which are then used to make various interior parts of a vehicle like a parcel shelf (the tray behind the rear seat of a car). In line with their net-zero goals, automakers have started using alternative materials in their future EV models. The Mahindra Thar.e, an electric variant of the Thar SUV, which is expected to hit the roads in a year, will use recycled PET bottles in 50% of seat fabric. All uncoated plastic in it will be recyclable, too, said the company while showcasing the vehicle last year.

Mahindra claims to be among the first automobile companies to use recycled and recyclable components in India. Pratap Bose, chief of design, M&M, told ET Auto recently that the company's design, engineering and material procurement team is taking a close look at parts that can be used without painting so that it is easier to recycle. ""If it has paint, that has to be stripped off. So small steps like these reduce complexities, making the material recyclable,"" he said.

Mahindra's plan to incorporate interior fabric made from plastic bottles in its upcoming EV range is a step in the green direction. However, when the company started work on this, it realised that it didn't have a tier-1 supplier to deliver sustainable parts. M&M then asked suppliers to make it their focus. ""The supplier base has now developed and they are able to come up with these materials specifically for us and you will see this in our Born EV range,"" Bose said.

Be it a small initiative like choosing to paint parts frugally or using recyclable material, the push from a vehicle manufacturer can have a multiplier effect on the entire value chain. ""A lot of global automakers that have India in their sourcing network are asking for it (parts made from alternative materials) as a prerequisite,"" says Shradha Suri Marwah, president, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association.

She expects the cost of parts made from recyclable materials -- which are currently at a premium compared with traditional ones -- to come down as the volume goes up. An enhanced focus on lightweight by automakers amid tightening regulation on emission fuel efficiency and electrification trend will only accelerate the efforts, she says.

Today, Jossou uses computer simulations for rational materials design, AI-aided purposeful development of cladding materials and fuels for next-generation nuclear reactors. As one of the shared faculty hires between the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and departments across MIT, his appointment recognizes his commitment to computing for climate and the environment.

A well-rounded education in Nigeria

Growing up in Lagos, Jossou knew education was about more than just bookish knowledge, so he was eager to travel and experience other cultures. He would start in his own backyard by traveling across the Niger river and enrolling in Ahmadu Bello University in northern Nigeria. Moving from the south was a cultural education with a different language and different foods. It was here that Jossou got to try and love tuwo shinkafa, a northern Nigerian rice-based specialty, for the first time.

After his undergraduate studies, armed with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, Jossou was among a small cohort selected for a specialty master's training program funded by the World Bank Institute and African Development Bank. The program at the African University of Science and Technology in Abuja, Nigeria, is a pan-African venture dedicated to nurturing homegrown science talent on the continent. Visiting professors from around the world taught intensive three-week courses, an experience which felt like drinking from a fire hose. The program widened Jossou's views and he set his sights on a doctoral program with an emphasis on clean energy systems.

A pivot to nuclear science

While in Nigeria, Jossou learned of Professor Jerzy Szpunar at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who was looking for a student researcher to explore fuels and alloys for nuclear reactors. Before then, Jossou was lukewarm on nuclear energy, but the research sounded fascinating. The Fukushima, Japan, incident was recently in the rearview mirror and Jossou remembered his early determination to address his own country's energy crisis. He was sold on the idea and graduated with a doctoral degree from the University of Saskatchewan on an international dean's scholarship.

Jossou's postdoctoral work registered a brief stint at Brookhaven National Laboratory as staff scientist. He leaped at the opportunity to join MIT NSE as a way of realizing his research interest and teaching future engineers. ""I would really like to conduct cutting-edge research in nuclear materials design and to pass on my knowledge to the next generation of scientists and engineers and there's no better place to do that than at MIT,"" Jossou says.

Merging material science and computational modeling

Jossou's doctoral work on designing nuclear fuels for next-generation reactors forms the basis of research his lab is pursuing at MIT NSE. Nuclear reactors that were built in the 1950s and '60s are getting a makeover in terms of improved accident tolerance. Reactors are not confined to one kind, either: We have micro reactors and are now considering ones using metallic nuclear fuels, Jossou points out. The diversity of options is enough to keep researchers busy testing materials fit for cladding, the lining that prevents corrosion of the fuel and release of radioactive fission products into the surrounding reactor coolant.

The team is also investigating fuels that improve burn-up efficiencies, so they can last longer in the reactor. An intriguing approach has been to immobilize the gas bubbles that arise from the fission process, so they don't grow and degrade the fuel.

Since joining MIT in July 2023, Jossou is setting up a lab that optimizes the composition of accident-tolerant nuclear fuels. He is leaning on his materials science background and looping computer simulations and artificial intelligence in the mix.

Computer simulations allow the researchers to narrow down the potential field of candidates, optimized for specific parameters, so they can synthesize only the most promising candidates in the lab. And AI's predictive capabilities guide researchers on which materials composition to consider next. ""We no longer depend on serendipity to choose our materials, our lab is based on rational materials design,"" Jossou says, ""we can rapidly design advanced nuclear fuels.""

Advancing energy causes in Africa

Now that he is at MIT, Jossou admits the view from the outside is different. He now harbors a different perspective on what Africa needs to address some of its challenges. ""The starting point to solve our problems is not money; it needs to start with ideas,"" he says, ""we need to find highly skilled people who can actually solve problems."" That job involves adding economic value to the rich arrays of raw materials that the continent is blessed with. It frustrates Jossou that Niger, a country rich in raw material for uranium, has no nuclear reactors of its own. It ships most of its ore to France. ""The path forward is to find a way to refine these materials in Africa and to be able to power the industries on that continent as well,"" Jossou says.

Jossou is determined to do his part to eliminate these roadblocks.

Anchored in mentorship, Jossou's solution aims to train talent from Africa in his own lab. He has applied for a MIT Global Experiences MISTI grant to facilitate travel and research studies for Ghanaian scientists. ""The goal is to conduct research in our facility and perhaps add value to indigenous materials,"" Jossou says.

Adding value has been a consistent theme of Jossou's career. He remembers wanting to become a neurosurgeon after reading ""Gifted Hands,"" moved by the personal story of the author, Ben Carson. As Jossou grew older, however, he realized that becoming a doctor wasn't necessarily what he wanted. Instead, he was looking to add value. ""What I wanted was really to take on a career that allows me to solve a societal problem."" The societal problem of clean and safe energy for all is precisely what Jossou is working on today.",nuclearpowerdaily.com,news,Nuclear Power Daily,,0.4509803921568627,448956904,1,https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/molecule-modification-improves-reprocessing-spent-nuclear-fuel-hg.jpg,

Arranging distribution of personal effects,"People doing their estate planning, and estate planning professionals, tend to focus on the big-ticket items -- real estate, investment accounts, funds in retirement plans, proceeds from life insurance policies, motor vehicles, etc. They pay less (or no) attention to personal effects -- that is, items of tangible personal property such as photo albums, jewelry, grandma's china, fishing rods, school yearbooks, baseball card collections, etc.

Although these assets are often of little economic value, their sentimental value can be enormous, and emotions within a family can run high when the time comes to divide them up. In fact, research has shown that the distribution of personal effects at death is responsible for more family acrimony than just about anything else (with the possible exception of disinherited children).

The Colorado Probate Code addresses this issue by allowing tangible personal property, other than money, to be distributed in accordance with a written statement left by the decedent at the time of death. A properly prepared will authorizing this procedure is necessary.

However, the formalities required of a will are not applicable to a personal property distribution statement. The decedent is permitted to prepare, and to change from time to time, a list of who gets what, with no witnesses or notaries required. The only requirements in addition to a will authorizing the procedure, are the statement must be in the decedent's handwriting or signed by the decedent, and the statement must describe the items of personal property, and who is to get them, with reasonable certainty.

No special form for this statement is required. However, lawyers who do estate planning are likely to have a form they like and will provide this form to their clients, along with basic instructions for its use.

If a decedent drops the ball and doesn't leave a list, or leaves only a partial list, the will is likely to contain a ""default"" instruction, such as all tangible personal property to surviving spouse, all to Uncle Ted, all to Salvation Army, all to local landfill, etc.

Another default instruction in a will might say that all tangible personal property not disposed of by a disposition statement becomes a part of the decedent's ""residuary estate"" -- that is, what's left after specific gifts are made from the estate. In that event, the personal representative for the estate will try to monetize (sell) these assets, with the proceeds distributed in accordance with the rules set out in the will for distribution of the residuary estate.

Also, the default instruction could be that the personal representative for the estate is given discretion to divide up the decedent's tangible personal property not disposed of by a statement as the personal representative sees fit.

In that case, the personal representative distributes these assets in a manner he or she thinks would be in keeping with the decedent's wishes (and has the best chance of keeping peace in the family). Under this strategy, unhappy relatives can be angry at the personal representative more than the decedent.

In all events, the distribution of tangible personal property at death is a matter to be taken seriously. And, if family peace is an estate planning objective, distribution decisions should be made in a considerate, thoughtful and sensitive manner.

Otherwise, seeds might be planted for post-mortem acrimony and additional estate administration legal expense.

🐙 Thanks to our sponsor OctoAI. Mixtral on OctoAI: 12x lower costs, 30% faster speeds vs GPT-4-Turbo.

Sunday chart: Will agents drive the next breakthrough in business adoption of AI?

Andrew Ng has said that ""AI agentic workflows will drive massive AI progress this year -- perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models"". His team shows that by employing iterative refinement techniques, the performance of language models like GPT-3.5 on coding tasks can improve dramatically from 48% to over 95%. Notably, the performance of GPT-3.5 in these workflows is very close to GPT-4.

As computational resources continue to expand -- as seen with NVIDIA's recent announcement of its next-generation Blackwell GPUs -- the feasibility of applying agentic workflows to a wider range of tasks will likely grow. At a system level, NVIDIA claims the new GPUs outperform the previous generation of H100s by over 30 times for inference. This will undoubtedly make agentic workflows more accessible and cost-effective. This increased computational capacity will enable users to apply agentic workflows to larger-scale tasks, such as iterating over an entire book instead of just a single chapter, at around the same cost.

Back in EV#458, we covered a study that found only 23% of vision tasks are worth automating at current costs. We questioned whether this finding would extend to large language models. Given the rate at which computation resources are expanding, combined with advancements in agentic workflows, I increasingly doubt that it does. As agents become drastically more cost-effective, they'll become no-brainers for businesses.

OctoAI is the fastest, most affordable option to run Mixtral 8x7B, and the engineering effort to switch is negligible as the API formatting is the same as OpenAI. Customers making the move see comparable quality, 12x savings, and 30% lower latency when switching from GPT-4-Turbo.

The new oil. Anticipating a future where their black gold may lose its lustre to renewable energy, Gulf monarchies UAE and Saudi Arabia are positioning themselves as essential players in the AI sector. The UAE has taken a comprehensive approach under its impressive AI Minister, Omar Al Olama: supporting the open-source AI model, Falcon; building computes capacity with Nvida and Cerebras; making use of low energy prices; and using access to health and industrial data. Saudi Arabia has plans for a $40 billion AI investment fund, making it the industry's largest investor. Along with other countries, they've endeavoured to entice AI talent from the EU, where the AI Act imposes the world's most stringent AI restrictions aimed at safeguarding the welfare of citizens (whether that's detrimental or beneficial to AI development). The world is getting spikier.

Markets: Morals are optional. In a thought-provoking critique, Nobel laureate Angus Deaton challenges the foundations of mainstream economics, suggesting it would benefit from some long-overdue introspection, especially at a time when exponential technologies are achieving great efficiencies and consolidating power. Economics has become overly focused on market efficiency, he argues, while neglecting the crucial roles of power and ethics. A recent NBER paper explores scenarios for the transition to AGI, with the unsurprising conclusion that wages are likely to collapse. Although not imminent, this scenario highlights the importance of considering the distribution of benefits, not just efficiency gains. Human well-being should be the primary concern, says Deaton, calling for economists to engage with ideas from other fields and adopt greater humility. (Similarly, in the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, 71% of Brits rejected the five-decade consensus view that companies should only focus on shareholder outcomes.)

Fractured projections. In 2023, climate change made its presence known to the public in a tangible way, with record-breaking temperatures that even climate modellers failed to predict accurately. Prominent NASA scientist Gavin Schmidt acknowledges that despite considering all existing theories, a large 0.2-degree discrepancy remains in explaining the unexpected warmth. While climate change sceptics often criticise the complexity of climate models, this knowledge gap ironically supports their argument, albeit in the opposite direction. Schmidt suggests two possible implications: either the climate has already shifted more rapidly than anticipated, or statistical inferences based on historical data are less reliable than previously believed.

What ever happened to the humans?1 Plummeting global fertility rates will lead to a demographically divided world, says a Gates-funded study in the Lancet. It recommends urgent action and innovative solutions to navigate these complex challenges. Countries with ageing populations may face labour shortages and pressure of social security programmes to the point that nations might implement pro-natal policies. Youth-heavy societies are in the regions with most chaotic institutions and facing the greatest climate challenges. It is a difficult mix. And I think the study poses an ever harder set of questions. By 2075, our whole species might, on average, be below the population replacement rate. Could the future belong to communities that maintained high fertility rates during the 22nd and 23rd centuries?

The chief executives of Nissan Motor Company and Honda Motor Company appeared together at a news conference in Tokyo to announce that Japan's second and third biggest automakers will look into areas with a potential for collaboration.

The details of the non-binding agreement are still being worked out, both sides said. The executives said the companies will develop core technologies together, but their products will remain different.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida stressed that speed is crucial for the companies in developing technological solutions.

""We don't have time,"" he said. ""It is significant that we have reached this agreement based on a mutual understanding that Honda and Nissan face common challenges.""

Honda President Toshihiro Mibe said the companies share common values and could create ""synergies"" in facing their formidable rivals.

The world's automakers are rapidly shifting toward electric vehicles, focusing on batteries and motors instead of gas engines, as concerns grow about emissions and climate change.

But Japanese automakers have fallen behind rivals such as Tesla of the United States and BYD of China in developing EVs, partly because they have historically been so successful with combustion engine vehicles.

Toyota Motor Corp, the world's largest automaker, has often said the world is not ready for a complete shift to EVs, in part because of the lack of a charging infrastructure, and instead has pushed hybrids, which have a gas engine in addition to an electric motor.

But Toyota is also expected to aggressively deliver on an EV push in coming years.

Nissan is relatively ahead in EVs among Japanese automakers because it was among the first to come out with an EV with its Leaf, which went on sale in late 2010.

High expectations for the Nissan-Honda agreement were reflected in sharp increases in the stock prices of both companies on Thursday after a Japanese media report said such a deal might be in the works.

Their shares continued to rise Friday, with Nissan finishing 3.2 per cent higher Friday and Honda rising 1.7 per cent. The agreement was announced after trading closed in Tokyo.

The executives said no mutual capital ownership is involved in the agreement for now, but the companies may look into the possibility down the road.

The pub, according to agents Halls Commercial, is offered for sale only due to the retirement of its existing proprietors.

Dating back to the 19th century, the inn is named after a historical drinking vessel made of leather with a silver mounted inscribed band around the rim known as 'the jacorra'.

With a large restaurant with seating for around 160, an open plan bar and a five-bedroomed residential accommodation on the first floor, Halls says the size and potential of the Olde Jack Inn ""can only be appreciated by undertaking an inspection"".

The outside of the pub includes an attractive seating area to the front, with seating for around 40, and a garden area to the side that can be used for a marquee or functions.

The pub also comes with a large car park. In total, the site covers a space of around half an acre.

The business is fully licensed and is free of tie, and according to the listing, it had a turnover for the financial year ending March 2023 of approximately £436,500 with a gross profit of approximately 65 per cent.

He underscored the importance of seizing this opportunity to forge a brighter future, noting that such a chance may only arise once in a lifetime.

""There may not be a third or fourth chance, so seize this opportunity to increase income and ensure you do not fall back into the financially vulnerable category,"" he told Bernama during a recent interview.

The Second Chance Policy is a government initiative designed to protect the welfare of individuals burdened by small-scale debts, that provides a pathway out of bankruptcy under specific criteria, effective from March 1, 2023.

During the tabling of the 2024 Budget last year, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar unveiled the extension of the Second Chance Policy to encompass individuals under 40 years old with debts not surpassing RM200,000, effective this year.

Anwar noted that nearly 14,000 bankruptcy cases involving minor debts under RM50,000 had been discharged as of July 2023.

Mohamad Fazli, also the Dean of the Faculty of Human Ecology at Universiti Putra Malaysia, underscored the initiative's capacity to mitigate the emotional burden and societal stigma attached to financial hardships culminating in bankruptcy filings.

He highlighted that many young bankrupt individuals often overspend in pursuit of extravagant lifestyles, and thus suggested that the government should monitor discharged individuals to prevent them from sliding back into debt.

""There should be continuous educational programmes to enhance financial literacy, particularly in managing debts and loans,"" he added.

Jaishankar's recent remarks on the situation in riot-hit Manipur state while addressing the Indian community in the South Korean capital Seoul must be understood from political as well as geo-strategic perspectives.

""Distressing is a very mild word ... for what is happening in Manipur,"" he told the Indian diaspora on March 5. It's been 10 months since the violence began in the northeastern state bordering crisis-ridden Myanmar. Officially 219 people have been killed so far, most of them Christians.

The pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state has dubbed it an ethnic conflict, but Christian leaders have accused it of siding with the majority Hindu Meitei community which is at odds with the tribal Christian Kuki-Zo people.

""In terms of ... how did this happen? How did the government let this happen? You know there cannot be anybody who would not regret what is happening there,"" the foreign minister said.

He sounded critical of the BJP government in Manipur. But Jaishankar is a member of the same party and a federal minister who has Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ears.

Manipur was one of multiple questions about India raised by the diaspora, and, in all probability, Jaishankar had the nod from the Prime Minister's Office for making those remarks.

Before coming to Manipur, the minister dwelt on how the Modi government brought the mere talk about ""Look East and Act East"" -- first devised in 1991 -- into actual practice and implemented several projects that benefit the entire northeast region.

""If you look at how difficult it was to travel, if you see the sort of level of business, the attention given, the resources given, it [the Manipur riot] was actually very disturbing. And that has been one of the changes of the last 10 years,"" he asserted.

He then stressed how he felt that ""in many respects, the northeast itself can act as a bridge, but it has both a cultural side to it and a physical contiguity side too.""

His explanation of what happened there was ""the close intermingling of communities"" leading to ""this degree of violence, which becomes very difficult to head off.""

The foreign minister was well aware that Korea has a substantial Christian population and the ethnic conflict in Manipur could draw criticism of the BJP governments in both New Delhi and in Manipur.

Tribal Christians, including Nagas and Kukis, form around 41 percent of Manipur's 3.6 million people. They primarily inhabit the hill districts.

The Meiteis make up some 53 percent of the population and reside in the Imphal Valley.

And then there are about 6,000 refugees from Myanmar taking shelter in the state.

Analyst Ashutosh Talukdar, who is based in the northeastern state of Assam, observed that a foreign minister ""would avoid making any remark on internal or domestic matters, leave aside a disturbing situation, on foreign soil.""

But Jaishankar could not have avoided northeast India as it is a bridge to neighboring countries such as Myanmar and other Southeast and East Asian countries.

New Delhi is well aware that violence and instability in Manipur can harm its long-term strategic interests and derail the ""Look East and Act East"" policy.

The minister's remarks thus have to be viewed through this perspective.

The situation in Manipur has not only embarrassed Modi and the BJP but may also derail the progress achieved since 2014, when Modi became prime minister, in developing economic cooperation and strategic relationships with countries in the wider Indo-Pacific region.

The Modi dispensation is keen on moving forward at bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels to enhance political, economic, cultural and people-to-people relations in the region.

Modi's critics point out that for four months after the riot broke out on May 3 last year, he did not utter a word and broke his silence only in August after a video went viral on social media showing two Christian Kuki women being sexually assaulted and paraded naked in the streets of Manipur.

Federal Home Minister Amit Shah told the Indian Parliament on Aug. 9 that, ""people crossing over from Myanmar"" were responsible for the distressing situation in the state.

Even Jaishankar echoed him when he said that the open border with Myanmar was one of the issues. ""We have decided now to suspend that [open border] and, actually, in a way, harden the border situation,"" he explained.

The bilateral Free Movement Regime allowed people from India and Myanmar to travel up to 16 kilometers into each others' territory without travel documents. That will stop now.

But Jaishankar's utterances in Korea must also be seen as a late application of balm on the festering wounds of Manipur, ahead of a general election this summer.

Modi is seeking a third term as prime minister and Manipur remains a weak spot for him.

The prime minister avoided campaigning in neighboring Mizoram during the state election in November-December 2023. But can he afford to skip the northeastern states now?

We ""would like to see law and order return,"" Jaishankar said while adding, ""This is not the India, and certainly not the northeast, which anybody is hoping for.""",southasiajournal.net,news,South Asia Journal,,-0.1764705882352942,448956159,1,,

The defence ministry's refusal to grant permission to Metro Railway to shift a market to build the proposed Esplanade station is the latest in a series of setbacks the Joka-Esplanade corridor has suffered.

The Esplanade station would have been the terminal station of the 16km corridor, which is now functional on an 8km elevated stretch between Joka and Majerhat. The 6km underground section is from Mominpore to Esplanade.

The Esplanade station is scheduled to come up where BC Roy Market now stands. The Metro authorities had planned to shift the traders to an upcoming complex above the Esplanade station of the East-West Metro (Green Line).

""The defence ministry has refused to grant us permission to build a station. The army is the custodian of the entire area. They are refusing permission since BC Roy Market is unauthorised,"" Metro general manager P. Uday Kumar Reddy said on Friday.

The project was conceived in 2010. Work on the 16km corridor had started in July 2011 but the project soon ran into land logjams.

It was stalled since 2011 because of a stand-off between the railways and defence ministry and construction could take place only between Joka and Majerhat.

Initially, the plan was to build a viaduct but the army, which is the custodian of the Maidan, objected to the plan. The defence ministry had agreed to allow tracks of the Joka-Esplanade Metro to go through the Maidan in 2015 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention.

However, there were issues such as additional cost and the army had objected to construction of entry and exit points for the underground Victoria Memorial and Park Street stations.

The breakthrough came in July 2019, after multiple meetings initiated by the state government. The railway ministry then allocated Rs 2,825 crore for the underground section.

Construction at Majerhat was also stalled for six months in the wake of the collapse of the Majerhat bridge in September 2018.

A PIL was filed in Calcutta High Court, seeking a ban on construction near the Victoria Memorial. It was only in February 2022 that the army informed the high court that it had no objection to construction under the Maidan.

A parcel of the Maidan has been barricaded for construction of the Victoria station. Some clubs around Park Street have been vacated for the construction.

The latest setback comes just when construction had gained momentum.

Esplanade is being built as a multi-modal transport hub connected to three Metro links -- North-South (Blue Line), East-West (Green Line) and Joka-Esplanade (Purple Line).

On Friday, Metro officials said if the permission for Esplanade station of the Purple Line does not come, then the Metro link from Joka would have to terminate at Park Street.

But a senior official told Metro on Saturday: ""The Purple Line has to reach Esplanade. There is no other way. The state government also wants the multi-modal transport hub at Esplanade. Rites has already done a detailed study in this regard. At Park Street, only two corridors (Blue and Purple lines) can be linked.""

A section of Metro officials blamed the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, the executing agency of the Purple Line.

""The RVNL rushed to award the tender for the construction of the underground section. The tender should have been awarded after all these things were taken care of,"" said an official.

The main problem in shifting BC Roy Market is allegedly unauthorised traders. ""We can rehabilitate only authorised shopkeepers. But more than half of the stall owners in the market are unauthorised,"" the official said.

Rajesh Shaw, general secretary of the traders' association in the market, said: ""There are around 500 shop owners here. They have valid papers. We do not have any direct link with the Metro Railway or the army. We are under the PWD (of the state government).""

A PWD official said the market was set up after a lease between the Centre and the state government in the 1950s. ""The lease period was a little over 20 years. So, it ended some time in the 1970s and was never renewed. So, the army has dubbed the entire market illegal,"" the official said.

A railway official doubted if all the drawings and detailed reports were shared with the army. ""The RVNL has messed things up. We have to go back to the drawing board and look at ways to resolve this,"" he said.

Amit Ray, executive director of RVNL, did not answer calls.

""There has been a problem. But we are hopeful of being able to sort it out,"" said Metro general manager Reddy.",telegraphindia.com,news,The Telegraph,Debraj Mitra,0.0117647058823529,448956121,1,https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/Mar/1711233492_new-project-1.jpg,

Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection.

At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets.

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla.

Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal will be held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1.

The excitement around space in India is attracting talent from around the world and inspiring them to start businesses and contribute to the growth of the sector, a senior World Economic Forum (WEF) official said.

The Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), a platform of the WEF, launched the space technology programme in India last week to forge global collaborations among various stakeholders as the private space sector takes wings in the country.

''India is seen as a role model, a lighthouse for smaller, aspiring space nations, which also look to India for support. This is something the WEF would like to facilitate, an exchange between large and emerging space nations in the interest of growing the space sector overall in an inclusive and responsible manner,'' Sebastian Buckup, member, Executive Committee, C4IR told PTI in an interview.

He said there was immense interest among entrepreneurs keen on leveraging the space sector.

''The fact that India is investing into shared infrastructure, for instance, launch infrastructure for small satellites, could eventually become an equivalent of the digital public infrastructure and what it has done for digital entrepreneurship,'' Buckup said.

He said if India managed to create a ''space public infrastructure'', it could be a cause for a boom when it comes to space entrepreneurship.

Buckup, during his India visit, had meetings with various stakeholders from the space sector, including officials from INSPACe, ISRO, and representatives of space start-ups and established players.

''I think many people outside of India are still describing India as an emerging space nation. The reality is that India has arrived in the top section of space actors, and there is an opportunity to shift the narrative and help the world understand what India has really achieved,'' he said.

Buckup said India's strides in the space sector also provided an opportunity to share its best practices and achievements ''We see a lot of momentum also in the private space sector in India, and we see a big focus on application, making space actually valuable on Earth. We want to work with stakeholders across India and leverage that excitement and connect it also with the rest of the world,'' he said.

On future trends for the space industry, Buckup said the space sector would soon emerge as a trillion dollar industry with virtually every company having some interest in the sector.

''I think it is fair to say that at some point, every economy will become a space economy and every company will become a space company. So, these economies and these companies should be ready for that,'' he said.

''There will be more and more applications that will focus on hard, difficult to solve problems on earth, in areas from communication to navigation to earth observation,'' Buckup said.

He said the growing interest in the space sector would also drive down costs and spur innovation that would be of economic and societal value.

According to the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the Indian space economy is valued at around nine billion dollars with a two per cent share in the global space economy. As per IN-SPACe's projection, India's space economy has the potential to reach 44 billion dollars by 2033 with about 8 per cent of the global share.

Mahindra & Mahindra plans to roll out five new electric SUVs by 2025, while Maruti Suzuki is investing in high-spec EVs with a 550 km range. Luxury automakers like Mercedes-Benz and Audi are also expanding their EV lineup. The government's new EV policy offers duty concessions to attract global players like Tesla, helping accelerate the EV ecosystem in India.

The Indian auto industry is gearing up to roll out an array of electric vehicle models over the next few years amid a renewed push by the government to encourage environment-friendly mobility solutions with the unveiling of a new policy.

Mass market players like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors are lining up new models to cater to the demand across segments.

Mahindra & Mahindra CEO Automotive Sector Nalinikanth Gollagunta told PTI that starting January 2025, the company will be rolling out five new battery electric vehicles in the coming years.

''These electric SUVs will be built on Mahindra's innovative INGLO platform and aim to cater to a variety of consumers through their diverse range. The launch of these SUVs is part of Mahindra's broader strategy to lead in the electric vehicle sector, and we expect 20-30 per cent of our portfolio to be electric by 2027,'' he noted.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) Rahul Bharti said the auto major is making serious investments in EVs.

''We will start production of a high-spec EV designed-fresh as an EV with 550 km range in FY24-25 and will have about six EV models in the next 7-8 years,'' he noted.

Bharti, however, noted that in order to cut carbon and oil imports, the country will require many more technologies like hybrid-electric, CNG, Bio-CNG, Ethanol flex fuel etc.

''We are committed to work on all such technologies also,'' he added.

Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said the automaker was among the first OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to introduce a fully long-range electric SUV KONA in India in 2019.

Last year, the company launched the IONIQ 5, its premium electric SUV.

Garg noted that as per multiple industry estimates, EVs are projected to contribute around 20 per cent of India's automotive market by 2030.

''With the Indian government's steadfast focus on electric vehicles and the supportive policy framework, we are confident that EVs will soon become mainstream, driving a sustainable automotive future for India,'' he added.

The company plans to invest around Rs 26,000 crore over 10 years in Tamil Nadu. This investment will also include setting up a battery assembly plant in the state.

A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company aims to have 10 EVs by 2026.

The company plans to introduce four more EV models this year, including Curvv EV and Harrier EV.

Luxury carmakers are also gearing up to enhance their EV lineup in the country.

''We are invested in the market, having an aggressive product strategy with more than 12 new products planned for debut in 2024, of which three will be new BEVs,'' a Mercedes-Benz India spokesperson said.

This well-defined roadmap will help the automaker deepen its BEV footprint, offering customers the best of luxury and technology, he added.

''Mercedes-Benz remains strategically focused and tactically flexible, as we believe customer preferences and market conditions will determine the pace of BEV transition,'' the spokesperson stated.

Audi India expects 50 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles by 2030.

The automaker, which sells four electric models in the country, plans to expand the product range to achieve its ambitious sales target.

Earlier this month, the government approved an electric-vehicle policy, under which duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like US-based Tesla.

Mahindra & Mahindra's Gollagunta stated that the policy reinforces the Make in India momentum, with requirements of bank guarantees, minimum investment commitment, and local value addition.

''This will help accelerate the EV ecosystem in India,'' he stated.

Artificial intelligence or AI branding is the most successful marketing campaign in history. But as everyone grapples with AI, technology leaders need to come up with new, more exciting and spooky brands to break out of the noise. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is on the horizon, and proclaiming that your company is at the forefront of the race to get there attracts rare AI talent and the attention of investors, policymakers, and world leaders. Collect.

Following a threat to sue companies involved in AI laundering, the SEC has fined two investment advisers for allegedly making false statements about their use of AI. Because the SEC is a regulatory agency, it is obsolete by definition. In 2024, AI will be a major part of earnings calls for all types of companies, regardless of what AI actually means, and it will be everywhere. In this overhyped environment, technology leaders need to accelerate and upgrade their marketing efforts from AI to his AGI. At this point, the SEC should actually investigate AGI washing, or false statements about the current or very near future existence of human-level artificial intelligence or even superintelligence.

Those who make these false statements use different definitions of AGI, even if they bother to provide one, and their definitions are usually not easily reconciled. for example,

Nvidias Jensen Huang: Software or computer that can complete tests that reflect basic intelligence comparable to that of a normal human. Coming within the next five years.

OpenAI: This decade will see the emergence of highly autonomous systems that can outperform humans at the most economically valuable tasks. Or AI systems that are generally smarter than humans, which Altman says will arrive in January 2024, and in the fairly near future.

Elon Musk's legal brief for OpenAI states that machines with human-like intelligence for a variety of tasks will be created in the form of GPT-4, an AGI algorithm that is better at reasoning than the average human. It has already appeared in .

Why are we talking so persistently about poorly defined AGI? Why is its arrival promised to be imminent?

The main driver of AGI washing is intense competition for scarce AI talent. How do you attract talent who can command up to $1 million in compensation? You can expect Mark Zuckerberg to be upfront about it. ""We need to build for general intelligence, and I think it's important to communicate that because a lot of talented researchers want to work on more ambitious problems.""

Venture capital firms want to invest in more ambitious solutions that promise higher returns. If you have millions of dollars itching to enter the startup economy and are suffering from severe existential FoMO or fear of missing out, OpenAI promises to Why not throw it at something that promises to change the limits, and maybe even the limits of personal bank accounts? For people like Zuckerberg who don't need VC anymore, AGI's talk is , helps ensure stock market investors don't miss out on the next big opportunity.

The final reason to promote AGI is to attract attention. Not the attention that comes from algorithms like the seminal paper that launched the generative AI race, ""Attention is All You Need,"" but the attention that people like Musk and Altman, as well as celebrities and wannabe celebrities, need. . The negative aspects of the AGI brand, dire prophecies about humanity's demise, elevate the status of the new masters of the universe, those who hold the secret keys to the power to uplift or degrade humanity. I guarantee you that.

AGI's inspiration is why a figure like Altman, whose charisma was limited to Silicon Valley until ChatGPT's late 2022 launch, would do so in the following year to captivate political leaders around the world. This explains why he was able to spend as much time as possible.

But one might wonder why Altman and other AGI advocates are so interested in spreading fake news about the impending extinction of humanity, rather than calling for government regulation. Yes, they do it. Technology industry leaders are well aware that government regulation favors incumbent companies and is certain to deter and slow new competition, including companies that insist on open sourcing their AI models (like Facebook). Masu.

Of course, many AGI proponents have not actually developed AGI or even AI. For them, the rewards that come with grants, interviews, speaking engagements, or even just being the center of attention for 15 minutes, or even just 15 seconds in modern times, are also in the spotlight.

AGI is a product of human imagination, delusion, and hallucinations, supported by modern religion and belief in modern materialism that humans are gods. If the brain is a computer, and humans created computers, then it is only a matter of time before we endow machines with human cognition and superpowers. AGI has been around since he coined the term artificial intelligence in 1955, but before that it was a persistently popular delusion as thinking machines.

The term AGI is relatively recent, being coined in 2007. In the next installment of his AGI Cleaning series, we will briefly discuss the history of this subject.

The discount markets for foodstuff (Ounje Eko) are part of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu's measures rolled out to cushion the effect of petrol subsidy removal on residents.

Mixed reactions had trailed the prices and other logistics at the markets when residents visited them on their first Sunday of operation.

The pilot scheme began with sales of discounted food items, such as rice, beans, garri, bread, eggs, and perishables like tomato, pepper and onions.

Omotosho said that activities in each market were being coordinated by government officials, youth volunteers and private sector payment solution providers, to ensure seamless operations.

He reiterated that Gov. Sanwo-Olu rolled out the initiative, amongst others, to impact lives in various sectors of the economy.

The commissioner said that a new market location had also been introduced in Lekki Phase 1 to cater to the needs of residents within the area.

He said that the detailed locations of Ounje Èkó markets could be found on all Lagos State Government social media platforms.

Residents had on March 17 trooped out in large numbers to the centres of ""Ounje Eko,"" Lagos Discounted Food programme, to purchase food items at cheaper prices.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that residents arrived as early as 6.00 a.m. at Lagos Progressive Junior Secondary school, Surulere, to benefit from the discounted food programme.

The programme, which was meant to start at 11.00 a.m., started one hour late due to unavailability of vouchers.

Mrs Abimbola Kanwei, 70 year-old, urged the government to adopt a better approach going forward as residents queued under the sun for hours before they could buy the food items.

NAN correspondent, who visited one of the centres in Ikorodu, reports that there were queues of prospective buyers, who were unable to make payment due to the inadequate number of machines.

NAN also reports that activities at the market did not start until 1.00 p.m due to lateness of some officials responsible for collection of money.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20 percent in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5 percent as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.",thestandard.com.hk,news,The Standard,,0.1372549019607843,448955385,1,https://www.thestandard.com.hk/images/instant_news/20240324/20240324134743contentPhoto1.jpg,

They have a tendency to be swayed by public opinion, which might be orchestrated by opposition parties, unions or the media. This government has followed this tradition rather zealously given that one of President Christodoulides' election pledges was that he would listen to the people.

A worrying aspect of this approach has been the constant state intervention in the market economy, which has created the impression that this is a government obligation, ostensibly to protect people. Continuous protests about 'expensiveness' - the populist term used for inflation - led the government to scrap VAT on a range of products, supposedly to protect purchasing power while keeping in place, by public demand, the reduced consumer tax on petrol long after the world price of crude oil had fallen.

Paradoxically, while inflation was rising, the government also decided to increase the percentage of CoLA paid, which pushed prices further up, while a little later the minimum wage was increased by more than 10 per cent, affecting some 25,000 workers. Although these measures made no difference in making the 'expensiveness' more manageable, they silenced the government's critics, to a large extent, while promoting the idea that state intervention in determining wages was a good thing.

This thinking was reinforced by the theatrical attempts by Finance Minister Makis Keravnos to persuade the banks not to increase interest rates in line with ECB rates so as to help people with housing loans. The banks ignored his public pleas and letters to go against the ECB policy aimed at fighting inflation across the euro zone, but the point that this government was prepared to interfere in the workings of the market was made yet again. Now it appears to have become a given and is expected to happen all the time.

Keeping with the spirit of the times, on Tuesday Labour Minister Yiannis Panayiotou, while reviewing his first year in office, boasted about all the restrictions he had imposed on the labour market. He appears to be on a mission to prevent the law of supply and demand determining wages, to the obvious delight of the unions he closely works with. He pledged to step up inspections of illegal workers by 65 per cent, carry out a census of all workers and give a say to unions about the employment of third country nationals.

All this at a time when we are close to full employment and by Panayiotou's own admission there is a need for some 150,000 foreign workers to cover the market's labour needs. Hoteliers, meanwhile, are complaining that they will not have enough staff to open for the tourist season. A pragmatic minister would have cut businesses some slack at a time of acute labour shortages, but Panayiotou is turning the screw on them, regardless of the harm he would cause the economy.

Panayiotou, to be fair, is not a renegade minister who has declared war on the market economy - the government has set the agenda. Apart from the above-mentioned cases, a couple of weeks ago, the council of ministers approved a bill that would allow the commerce minister to fix prices for products of broad consumption at specific points of sale. Explaining the decision, minister George Papanastasiou gave as an example bottled water at ports and airports. It was a disingenuous example, considering the price of bottled water at airports hardly merited control through legislation. We suspect there is a hidden agenda and the government would use this law to set maximum prices on other products.

Giving itself more powers to intervene in the market is a very dangerous path, putting at risk the operation of the market economy, to which Cyprus owes its growing prosperity. Living standards have steadily risen because, since joining the EU, the market has opened up and the old restrictions were scrapped. It is thanks to a smoothly functioning free economy that Cypriots enjoy such a good standard of living today. It is certainly not thanks to meddlesome bureaucrats and politicians interfering and placing restrictions on the market's operation to curry favour with interest groups. There are enough union imposed imperfections in the market, which create costly distortions, without the government adding to them.",cyprus-mail.com,news,Cyprus Mail,Our View,-0.04313725490196074,448955358,1,https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/christo-1024x677.jpg,

After the signing ceremony, Hur and Pascucci toured the flagship Paris Baguette store in southern Seoul, as well as the Lab of Paris Baguette, located in the IT Valley of Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province.

As the economy continues to show signs of strength, investors are shifting their focus away from growth and technology stocks towards other sectors such as financials, industrials, and energy. This shift comes as the Federal Reserve signals a more dovish approach and expresses confidence in addressing inflation, potentially even cutting interest rates this year.

The S&P 500 has seen gains across various sectors this year, with financials up 10.1%, industrials up 9.9%, and energy up 10.3%. This broadening rally has reduced concerns about the market's reliance on a small group of megacap stocks, with more S&P 500 stocks outperforming the benchmark compared to last year.

Despite the reassuring economic outlook, some investors anticipate potential market volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios at the end of the first quarter. This contrast in market dynamics from last year, when uncertainty favored megacap stocks, has investors looking beyond the usual suspects for investment opportunities.

While some still see potential for continued growth, others are wary of a possible pullback after recent market gains. Chase Investment Counsel, for example, has been selling off megacap holdings and investing in other sectors due to the broadening market trend.

Although small caps have remained subdued for now, some believe they could benefit from the Fed's outlook on interest rates. However, challenges could arise if the economy falters or overheats, potentially impacting the market's broadening trend.

Overall, the market's performance indicates a shift in investor sentiment, with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence boosting shares of companies like Nvidia, while tech giants such as Apple and Tesla face setbacks.

AKD Securities Ltd said the outgoing week commenced with the State Bank of Pakistan's Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Monday, where the central bank maintained its policy rate at 22 per cent for the sixth consecutive review, though the decision did not impact the market as it was already expected and priced-in.

Furthermore, talks with the IMF mission on the SBA's final review concluded on Tuesday with an SLA, resulting in infused positivity into the equity market and international investors as well as appreciation in dollar bonds hitting a two-year high and the benchmark KSE 100-share index staging a robust rally.

As discussions progressed, prerequisites for the next medium-term programmes have surfaced, primarily focusing on broadening the tax base. News has circulated about a new plan to collect taxes from retailers through electricity bills, which has been shared with the IMF.

Additionally, IMF has recommended eliminating general sales tax exemptions on petroleum products and other taxes, whereby, despite easing weekly inflation, an increase in gas price (as sought by Sui companies) and implementation of 18pc GST on POL products pose risks to the inflation outlook.

On the economic front, the current account for February turned positive, with a surplus of $128m, narrowing the current account deficit to just below the $1bn mark in 8MFY24. With a controlled current account balance, SBP's reserves position also increased by $105m reaching $8.0bn during the week ended on March 15.

With the IMF's smooth review, market participation improved by 13pc WoW, with the daily traded volume averaging at 323m shares compared to 287m shares in the previous week.

Arif Habib Ltd said the stock market remained mixed since the investors maintained a careful stance in the outgoing week.

On the other hand, foreign direct investment (FDI) declined by 17pc year-on-year in the 8MFY24, arriving at $821m. The rupee closed at Rs278.14 against the greenback, strengthened by Rs0.60 or 0.22pc week-on-week.

As a result, the market closed at 65,152 points after adding 335 points or 0.52pc week-on-week.

Sector-wise positive contributions came from fertiliser (475 points), commercial banks (309 points), paper & board (34 points), automobile assemblers (29 points) and tobacco (21 points).

Meanwhile, the sectors which negatively contributed were cement (244 points), oil & gas exploration companies (156 points), technology & communication (40 points), refinery (30 points) and food & personal care products (24 points).

Scrip-wise positive contributors were Dawood Hercules (212 points), Meezan Bank Ltd (172 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (164 points), National Bank of Pakistan (105 points) and MCB Bank (77 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (117 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (115 points), Habib Bank Ltd (84 points), Systems Ltd (77 points) and Lucky Cement (76 points).

Foreign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $2.0m compared to a net buy of $2.7m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($0.8m) and exploration & production ($0.6m). On the local front, selling was reported by companies ($9.0m) followed by banks/DFIs ($5.0m).

AKD Securities Ltd noted that with the aforementioned tax reforms, price increases, particularly with the imposition of GST on POL products, could pose a risk to the CPI-based inflation outlook and potential delay in interest rate cuts, resulting in restrained market performance.

However, successful implementation of tax reforms would have a positive impact on long-term economic stability.

Additionally, with the SBP's real effective exchange rate increasing to 102.2 in February, there is a risk of currency devaluation, especially in case of increased smuggling or imports.

In a statement released on Saturday, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, informed residents about the price differences expected across different locations as the markets resume operations this Sunday, following their debut on March 17.

Naija News recalls that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu introduced these discount markets, known as ""Ounje Eko,"" as part of a broader initiative to alleviate the economic impact on Lagosians.

The initiative saw mixed reactions from residents concerning the prices and logistical setup during its first operational Sunday.

The scheme aims to make essential commodities more affordable for the masses by starting with a variety of discounted food items, including rice, beans, garlic, bread, eggs, tomatoes, peppers, and onions.

The operations within each market are overseen by a combination of government officials, youth volunteers, and private-sector payment solution providers to ensure smooth transactions and accessibility for all residents.

Mr. Omotosho highlighted the government's commitment to positively impacting lives across various sectors, emphasizing the importance of the ""Ounje Eko"" initiative in this endeavor.

He also announced the addition of a new market location in Lekki Phase 1, expanding the reach of the programme to cater to more residents. Information on the locations of the Ounje Èkó markets is available on all Lagos State Government social media platforms.

The initial launch of the programme attracted large crowds, with residents gathering as early as 6:00 a.m. at the Lagos Progressive Junior Secondary School, Surulere, to take advantage of the discounted prices.

Despite the programme's intended start time at 11:00 a.m., operations were delayed by an hour due to the unavailability of vouchers, leading to lengthy queues and discomfort under the sun.

This has prompted calls from the public, including a plea from 70-year-old Mrs. Abimbola Kanwei, for the government to refine the approach for future iterations of the market.

Furthermore, some residents have expressed dissatisfaction with the commodity prices at the discount markets in Badagry, prompting the Lagos State Government to address these concerns and ensure a more uniformly beneficial experience across all market locations.",naijanews.com,news,Naija News,Ayomide Emeka Joseph,0.1215686274509804,448955005,1,https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gbenga-Omotosho.jpg,eng-9421150

Just like jewel boxes, when you open the door to a tiny home, you anticipate finding something beautiful and unique inside. In these compact dwellings, simplicity meets elegance and every square foot serves a purpose, as there is no room for things that are just there to take up space. 14 photosPhoto: Havenn Tiny Homes The Clair tiny house model takes the idea of living simply and with fewer possessions to a luxurious new level with an incredibly open and thoughtful layout, quality materials, and beautiful furnishings and finishes.

This elegant micro-home was crafted by Havenn Tiny Homes, an Australian builder based in Melbourne, Victoria, that was founded in 2021. It's a relatively new player in the tiny house market and only has a handful of models in its lineup. Nonetheless, each of their models is elegantly designed and highly functional, challenging traditional perceptions of small-space living and ensuring that reducing your living space doesn't mean losing out on comfort or style.

Through its creations, Havenn aims to prove that tiny houses are ""not just a place to live but a pathway to a more sustainable, financially liberating, and aesthetically pleasing lifestyle."" To that end, the builder uses materials that are good for the environment, renewable energy, rainwater collection systems, composting toilets, and more to allow for a truly eco-friendly way of living.

Photo: Havenn Tiny Homes The Clair tiny home is proof that you can live a simpler yet more fulfilled and more sustainable life in a diminutive dwelling. It measures 28 feet (8.5 meters) in length, 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) in width, and 14.1 feet (4.3 meters) in height and boasts a design that prioritizes versatile functionality to ensure it can cater to diverse needs and lifestyles.

Built on a Duragal steel tri-axle trailer, this compact house boasts a modern, industrial aesthetic from the outside due to the dark steel siding and roof, with some timber accents softening up the look.

The modern, open-design interior layout with a spacious living room, an impressive kitchen, and a sleeping loft makes it ideal for couples and small families, as it can sleep up to four individuals in a queen loft and ground-level queen daybed.

The interior feels cozy and comfortable while also exuding luxury and class through an eclectic combination of quality materials, soft textures, and neutral colors. From the moment you step inside, you can't help but notice that every detail has been meticulously curated, from the exquisite furniture pieces to the kitchen fixtures and decor items, to create a refined and inviting atmosphere. The sleek lines, functional layout, and simple color palette dominated by neutral tones contribute to creating a clutter-free ambiance.

Photo: Havenn Tiny Homes What's more, the design is focused on practicality, with all the amenities one needs to live comfortably and sustainably. As you enter, you are greeted by a luminous lounge and dining area that invite conviviality. A cozy daybed with integrated storage is strategically placed next to an oversized window to allow those inside to take in the surrounding views, while the double glass doors ensure a seamless indoor-outdoor flow, which is a staple of Aussie tiny homes.

Next to the daybed, a dining table set for two creates the perfect setting for tranquil, romantic dinners, but there seems to be enough space for a larger table if you want to host family dinners.

The adjacent kitchen is all about functionality and style, with a timeless black-and-white aesthetic, a large pass-through window, and modern appliances. Sleek, high-gloss cabinets combine beautifully with white subway tiles, brass hardware, and the black-framed bi-fold window to enhance the classic elegance of this cooking space. In terms of functionality, it is well kitted out with a full-size fridge, a two-burner cooktop, an oven, a range hood, a dishwasher, and a deep sink. The washer/dryer combo is also located in the kitchen area.

Photo: Havenn Tiny Homes Opposite the kitchen counters, a sleek staircase leads up to the cozy sleeping loft. With its high vaulted ceiling, a black accent wall, and large windows that invite plenty of natural light in, it evokes a sense of tranquility. The space is roomy enough to fit a queen-size bed and a couple of nightstands and offers beautiful views of the downstairs as it's completely open, with just a simple railing for protection.

Clair also benefits from a nice bathroom space that is surprisingly modern and elegant. It's compact but cleverly designed to include a walk-in shower cabin, a stylish wall-mounted vanity with a circular sink basin and large oval mirror, and a toilet. It is completely private, hiding behind a sliding barn door, and the all-white design gives it a pristine look.

Sneaky storage solutions can be found in key areas of this tiny home, increasing its functionality, including built-in storage under the lounge daybed, storage stairs, and plenty of cabinetry in the kitchen.

Designed for the minimalist who doesn't want to compromise on luxury and comfort, the Clair tiny home is a masterpiece of style and functionality. It costs AUD $119,000 (approx. USD $79,350), and its versatility makes it perfect for various uses, from a permanent abode to a cozy vacation retreat to a chic Airbnb rental.",autoevolution.com,news,autoevolution,Ancuta Iosub,0.5215686274509803,448954951,1,https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/this-luxury-tiny-home-offers-a-perfect-fusion-of-luxury-practicality-and-sustainability-231252_1.jpg,

The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets?

VOV.VN - The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to contribute trillions of US$ to the global economy annually, with Vietnam being forecast to become an ""AI dragon"", thereby helping to further promote AI development in Southeast Asia.

This statement was made by Rafael Frankel, director of Public Policy for Southeast and South Asia at Meta Group, at a recent press conference announcing the Vietnam Innovation Challenge (VIC) 2024.

He said there are many reasons why he remains optimistic and believes that the nation will turn into a ""dragon"" in AI.

The Meta Group representative said that the first time he came to the country was 23 years ago. Since then, the Vietnamese economic picture has changed markedly and the nation's economic growth over the past generation can be seen as being very strong.

People have great determination and have shown a start-up spirit, while many businesses have become trusted partners of US firms, he added.

Frankel said he will continue to support Vietnamese enterprises in developing innovation, as well as promoting AI and semiconductors, thereby enabling them to become partners of US businesses.

According to Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Duy Dong, alongside the development of AI technology, the country has also taken strong steps in promoting AI research, application, and human resource development.

In 2021, the Vietnamese Government issued the National Strategy on AI research, development, and application until 2030.

After two years of implementation, the country has achieved encouraging achievements, noting that in 2022 it ranked 55th out of 180 countries and territories in the AI readiness index, up seven places compared to 2021, according to a report by Oxford Insights.

The nation also has businesses that have recorded significant achievements in research and application of AI, such as FPT, Viettel AI, VNPT AI, and VIN AI. This further proves the capacity and position of engineers and Vietnamese experts in research and development of AI technology applications, Deputy Minister Dong stated.

Vu Duy Thuc, co-founder of New Turing Institute & VietAI, underlined the need to determine the specific value that AI brings in order to fully consider developing products which have superior features for users.

Meanwhile, Phung Viet Thang, country director of Intel Vietnam, said that with Vietnamese advantages, making the best use off semiconductor and AI technology needs a clear strategy and support from the Government.

Encouraging innovation and development in all high-tech, semiconductor, and AI industries will therefore create plenty of opportunities for local businesses as the country has the advantage of abundant resources and readiness.

However, readiness will not bring about long-term advantages without a national vision strategy, Thang emphazised.

The Indian stock market witnessed a notable rebound in the week ending March 22, buoyed by a strong recovery in the latter half of the week. The resurgence was fueled by a dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve and robust buying activity by domestic institutions, countering the selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs).

Initially, the market exhibited caution ahead of the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. However, sentiment turned bullish after the US Federal Reserve revised its economic growth forecast for 2024 upward to 2.1% and signalled a possibility of three rate cuts this year, despite inflation surpassing its long-term target of 2%.

The BSE Sensex closed 0.3% higher at 72,832, while the Nifty 50 also rose by the same margin to reach 22,097. Notably, the broader markets showed resilience, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index climbing 1.3% and the Smallcap 100 index surging 1.4% after experiencing significant corrections in the previous week. While most sectors participated in the market's upswing, technology and FMCG sectors lagged behind.

Looking ahead to the upcoming week, experts anticipate the market to remain range-bound and volatile due to the monthly derivative contracts' expiry and reduced trading volume owing to holidays. All eyes will be on the US GDP numbers, which are expected to influence global investor sentiment.

Here are some key factors that are likely to dominate discussions on Dalal Street in the coming week:

US GDP Data: Investors globally will closely monitor the quarterly US GDP final data scheduled for release on March 28. The speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on March 29 will also be scrutinized for insights into the timing of rate cuts and the inflation outlook.

Global Economic Data: Apart from US GDP numbers, market participants will focus on various economic indicators, including new home sales, durable goods orders, jobs data, PCE prices, and personal income & spending data from the US. Additionally, data from the Bank of Japan's monetary policy meeting minutes, UK GDP numbers for Q4-2023, and China's current account data for Q4-2023 will be watched.

Domestic Economic Data: On the domestic front, attention will be on current account and external debt numbers for Q3FY24, fiscal deficit and infrastructure output data for February, and foreign exchange reserves for the week ended March 22.

FII & DII Flow: Market watchers will track the flow of funds from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs). Despite subdued FII inflows, strong buying by DIIs has been supporting the market.

Oil Prices: The trajectory of oil prices, influenced by geopolitical tensions and global economic factors, will continue to impact market sentiment. While oil prices experienced some cooling towards the end of the week, experts maintain a bullish outlook in the short to medium term.

IPO Activity: The primary market is expected to witness significant activity, particularly in the SME segment. Several IPOs are scheduled for launch, including SRM Contractors in the mainboard segment and offerings from Trust Fintech, Vruddhi Engineering Works, Blue Pebble, Aspire & Innovative Advertising, and GConnect Logitech and Supply Chain in the SME segment.

F&O Expiry: Volatility is expected as the market approaches the monthly F&O expiry on March 28. Options data indicates key support and resistance levels for the Nifty 50.

India VIX: The India VIX, a measure of market volatility, fell during the week, providing some relief to investors. Continued stability in volatility could bolster confidence among market participants.

While the market demonstrated resilience amid global economic uncertainties, investors should remain vigilant and monitor key indicators to navigate potential volatility in the week ahead. With a mix of domestic and international factors at play, prudent risk management strategies will be crucial for market participants.

The Lyn Family/Island Grill Scholarship in Technology, as it is named, was announced at the ICHS Hall of Fame Alumnae Induction benefit gala at Jamaica Pegasus on Saturday, March 16, 2024.

Held under the theme 'Learn, Lead, Lift,' the gala raises money to enable ICHS maintain its tradition of academic excellence, by ensuring the school is equipped for learning and that as many students as possible have the opportunity to follow their dreams and surpass their goals.

Lyn, who was the first inductee at inaugural Hall of Fame gala in 2013, is known for her philanthropy and passion for empowering young women.

At this year's event she lauded the school for producing outstanding graduates for more than 166 years, and ensuring they have access to a stellar cadre of role models, mentors and an invaluable network of 'Big Sisters' to support them as they embark on their varied career paths.

This year's Hall of Fame inductees are Margaret Campbell for her service in the field of education; Donette Chin-Loy Chang for community leadership and philanthropy; Cathrine Sani for social services and volunteerism; and Michelle Gyles-McDonnough for international relations and public service.

Steven Woodham received the President's Award for outstanding service.

Established in 2013 to recognise and honour outstanding ICHS alumnae, the gala is one of the largest networking fund-raisers of the Alumnae Association. This year's event has an ambitious target of raising $10 million for scholarships.

""Generational success means national success. It means sustainability and security for our nation and generations to come. This is exemplified by ICHS as a pillar of the Jamaican society,"" Lyn said at the gala.

""There is immeasurable value in paying it forward. Nation building is incumbent on us remembering on whose shoulders we stood, lifting others on ours as we carry them on that path, illuminated by four Ps: passion, perseverance, planning and purpose.

""Big congrats to our ICHS Alumnae Association for embodying all four Ps in the execution of this gala and by continuously working on projects at our alma mater,"" she said.

Island Grill Senior Marketing Officer Denille Ashwood Bahadosingh, who is also an ICHS alumna, said the education she received at the high school laid the perfect foundation for her academic and career growth.

""Our 'Big Sisters' from our alumnae, like Mrs Lyn, always aim for the stars

-- Ad Astra, Per Apera

-- and also stretch out a helping hand along the way, for which I'm extremely grateful,"" she said.

Ashwood Bahadosingh committed two of her monthly Island Grill Marketing Voucher allotment to ninth grader Zoelle Jamel who will represent Jamaica at the upcoming Carifta Games.

""We had to ensure that this outstanding student, just named to the national team and heading to the Carifta Games, will 'Eat Good, Live Good',"" Ashwood Bahadosingh said, utilising the Island Grill tagline.

Unlocking success in the Asian market, especially China, demands a smart strategy that weaves together cultural smarts, tailored localisation, strong relationships, adaptability and a dash of sustainability.

Recent economic vulnerabilities highlight the importance of diversifying export markets. To enhance economic resilience SA must not only enter new markets but also expand and consolidate its presence in existing ones.

The success of entering and expanding in Asian markets, particularly China, requires a nuanced approach. Prioritising cultural fluency, sustainability, innovation and strategic partnerships is essential for businesses aiming to thrive in the dynamic and diverse Asian market.

Trade has been a linchpin for supporting both rural and urban communities in SA, bolstering incomes and creating jobs. Given its significance, it's imperative that we maintain a steadfast focus on expanding our export markets.

In particular, the agricultural sector, a cornerstone of the Western Cape economy, relies heavily on international trade to sustain farm profitability and spur job growth. About half of the country's produce is designated for export, emphasising the importance of global markets for economic prosperity.

However, recent economic challenges have emerged due to geopolitical tensions and an overreliance on a limited number of markets. Take, for example, a large chunk of our agricultural exports, which now go mainly to a handful of Asian countries and the EU. To boost our economic resilience it's crucial that we embrace a strategy to diversify our export destinations.

This strategy goes beyond just entering new markets; it involves both expanding into new territories and consolidating our presence in existing ones. The aim is to reduce our vulnerability to unexpected changes in trade terms and ensure a steady flow of export revenues. To achieve this, it's crucial that we enhance the efficiency of our logistics, both for domestic transportation and exports. This becomes even more important as we strive to solidify our standing in current markets and smoothly venture into new ones.

Despite challenges in SA's ports, railway lines, and roads -- as pointed out by Agricultural Business Chamber chief economist Wandile Sihlobo -- it is important not to let logistical setbacks deter our efforts in export and international marketing. Instead, those responsible for logistics and infrastructure need to intensify their efforts to overcome existing obstacles (""Agricultural exports hit record despite logistical bars"", February 28). Simultaneously, trade and agricultural authorities should actively explore and open up new export markets, as rightly emphasised by Sihlobo. It's a collective effort to ensure our economic growth improves and stays resilient.

Wesgro, the agency tasked with promoting exports, facilitating trade deals for businesses in Cape Town and the Western Cape and nurturing exporter development, is doubling down on its efforts to open up new export avenues. Specifically, we are homing in on key Asian markets such as China, to maximise opportunities for local businesses. This involves participating in international trade missions, such as trade exhibitions and outward selling missions.

Throughout the year, Wesgro hosts a series of events aimed at promoting and developing Western Cape-based exporters. In addition, the organisation co-ordinates meetings and site visits for procurement teams from foreign companies interested in doing business with local producers and manufacturers. This proactive approach aligns with the broader goal of boosting economic growth and sustainability through diversified trade initiatives.

Asia's allure -- taking a closer look at China's influence

In today's ever-changing global business landscape China stands out as a compelling combination of challenge and opportunity. China, being the world's second most populous country after India and a rapidly expanding economic powerhouse, has consistently surpassed global GDP per capita growth since the late 1970s. This trend is also observed in other Asian economies. Impressively, annual gains have for the most part exceeded 5% since 2000, making the region an attractive prospect for businesses eyeing expansion.

What further emphasises China's importance in the global economic landscape is its role as the world's leading exporter of goods since 2007, and it holds the position of the second-largest importer globally, after the US.

China holds a pivotal position as a core market for the Western Cape, SA's agricultural powerhouse responsible for more than 50% of the country's primary agricultural exports. In 2023 China emerged as the top Asian export market for the province, with an export value totalling R16.1bn. The Asian region as a whole constitutes the third-largest export destination for the Western Cape, valued at R48.3bn and experiencing a remarkable 14% average annual growth from 2018 to 2023.

On a national level SA's exports to China have seen a significant surge, making it the largest export destination since 2009, reaching a high of R227.83bn in 2023. In addition, China stands out as one of SA's major trading partners within the Brics bloc.

Looking beyond China, Southeast Asian countries -- collectively known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- present substantial growth opportunities. Comprising Brunei Darussalam, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ASEAN has become one of the fastest-growing economic blocs globally.

With a combined GDP of $3.24-trillion and a population of 679.45-million people in 2022, the region's urbanisation and rising nonfarm income levels offer promising avenues for the expansion of SA's agricultural exports, creating a broader horizon for market diversification.

Market entry and expansion

Now, the question arises: how can we optimise on opportunities in China and the broader Asian market? To thrive in the Asian market, especially in China, a nuanced approach is crucial, encompassing cultural, economic and regulatory factors. Businesses aiming for growth must prioritise cultural fluency, adaptation, innovation, partnerships and sustainability. Success depends on understanding diverse cultures, particularly in China, and tailoring strategies accordingly. This involves investing in cultural training, language proficiency and grasping local nuances.

Navigating China's regulations requires astute government relations and compliance strategies, a principle applicable across much of Asia. Embracing corporate social responsibility initiatives aligned with local values is increasingly vital, enhancing reputation and consumer resonance. Sustainability is paramount, especially given China's commitments to reduce carbon intensity and expand renewable energy.

Prioritising sustainability and corporate social responsibility resonates with environmentally conscious Asian consumers, enhancing success prospects. Succeeding in the Asian market, notably in China, demands a culturally attuned strategy emphasising innovation, adaptability, and understanding consumer preferences.",businesslive.co.za,news,BusinessLIVE,,0.584313725490196,448954621,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VIFwTGOCKzpKdoMooNK3fdKyr4AYReNUflHSv7XTJWH_vYfib90z96zB9JMLHrghiBGMG1jBgEW7ID-CwMbYXph6cx7-2veRih1JnvDrb0nRRg=s1000,

On Friday, investors took further heart from a 21 per cent debut gain for EQT-owned Galderma, which also priced its shares at the top of its range. The Swiss dermatology giant raised 2 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) in the biggest European float since Porsche's debut two years ago.

A sustained reopening of the IPO market could boost dealmakers' animal spirits more generally as well as ease strains on private equity firms that typically rely heavily on IPOs as a means of exiting investments. One banker described the success of the Galderma deal as ""a sigh of relief"" for private equity.

Deal flow, however, is likely to be more of a steady stream than the flood seen in the past boom, which ended early in 2022.

""There is fundamental demand from investors but only at the right price and for companies with good stories,"" said Achintya Mangla, JPMorgan's global ECM head. ""To build a really good foundation for the IPO market, we still need to see this year's IPOs perform three, six months out.""

Since 2021, when companies sold shares worth $US154 billion in the US as the wider market roared higher, IPOs in New York have raised only a combined $US36 billion, according to Dealogic data. Deals have been smaller too, raising an average $US151 million, less than half the $US388 million of 2021.

Confidence in the potential for IPOs has been helped by the recent market rally. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 19 per cent in six months, while volatility - a threat to would-be floats - has remained low. This week the Federal Reserve lifted its economic growth outlook, adding to investor confidence that corporate profits could continue to grow.

""To move forward with an IPO, management have to be confident in the economic backdrop and the expected performance of their business - that confidence is starting to improve,"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of Americas ECM for Morgan Stanley.

Companies expected to go public soon include cold storage chain Lineage Logistics, which is seeking a valuation above $US30 billion, and cybersecurity provider Rubrik, valued at $US4 billion last year.

Healthcare payments software group Waystar filed publicly for an IPO in November, but ultimately held back.

Listings expected soon in Europe include Permira-backed Golden Goose, the Italian luxury sports shoe brand, and Puig, the Spanish beauty and fashion group behind brands including Charlotte Tilbury.

Bigger US prizes down the line include Nvidia-backed software group Databricks, valued at $US43 billion in a funding round last year and payments group Stripe, worth about $US50 billion.

Investors have so far shown the most interest in more mature companies that are profitable or can convince would-be buyers that they will be soon.

David Ludwig, global head of ECM at Goldman Sachs, said investors were still being careful over valuations.

""The amount of time they are spending with quality companies ahead of potential listings is constructive,"" he added.

""Companies need to show growth and a path to profitability. Investors are very willing to deploy capital, but they're still very disciplined and they're providing us with very detailed valuation thoughts,"" said Keith Canton, Americas head of ECM at JPMorgan.

Preparing to go public takes several months, meaning companies only just starting the process could at best debut in the autumn. If there is volatility around November's US presidential election, that could push some into 2025.

""If the market remains constructive, it will pull more companies into the IPO process,"" said a senior ECM specialist. ""We've been expecting a gradual reopening in 2024 and then if activity continues to accelerate, we will head into 2025 with a deeper pool of companies and a more normalised IPO market.""",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.4509803921568627,448954516,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8011%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_157%2C$y_239/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/e345b82b06c3e19a5fb3a36a951655125e9903a1,eng-9421689

MANILA, Philippines: The Department of Energy (DoE) said Sunday the Luzon grid could suffer a slight power shortage beginning next month that could trigger yellow alerts.

The DoE said based on simulations, there could be yellow alerts in April and May because hydroelectric power plants may run below capacity levels due to El Niño.

Yellow alerts are issued when the operating reserve is not enough to meet the transmission grid's contingency requirements but these do not usually result in power outages.

""The summer period exerts significant pressure on electricity demand due to increased cooling needs, leading to peak demand shifts in consumption and infrastructure strain,"" Secretary Raphael Lotilla said.

""We are therefore closely coordinating with all the stakeholders to carefully manage and plan for the effects of the summer period and the ongoing El Niño to ensure reliable and sustainable electricity supply,"" he added.

Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection.

At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets.

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union Minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Mr. Barla was replaced with the party's Assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union Minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Mr. Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 Assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Mr. Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Mr. Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the State, has also been trying to pacify Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Barla.

Mr. Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30% of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Mr. Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union Territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Mr. Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP State president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal will be held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1. Results will be announced on June 4.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding $3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum.

Decisive steps to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and giving more space for market-based corrections in the property sector could accelerate a solution to current property sector problems and lift up consumer and investor confidence, she said.

China will carefully study issues of market access and cross-border data flows and will soon issue new regulations in these areas, Premier Li Qiang told an audience of global CEOs and Chinese policymakers on Sunday.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilize economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

The word START in today's title alerted me to look at the beginning of the theme answers in search of theme material. When I uncovered SHOT GLASSES and realized it hinted at JUMP SHOT, my theory was confirmed. ROPE LADDERS is my favorite of today's theme answers. I've always been a fan of treehouses, though I find ROPE LADDERS a bit tricky to navigate. Thank you, Taylor, for this enjoyable puzzle.

Astronomers have identified two ancient streams of stars - named after the Hindu deities Shakti and Shiva - that appear to be among the Milky Way's earliest building blocks, offering new insight into how our galaxy came together long ago. These structures, found using observations from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope, may be relics of two distinct galaxies that merged roughly 12 billion years ago with the Milky Way's primordial pieces during the galaxy's infancy, the scientists said.

This is part of reforms that the markets regulator and other stakeholders are implementing to inject fresh interest in the bourse, which attracted a quick succession of listings during President Mwai Kibaki's administration.

CMA through legal notice tightened the rules for electronic IPOs to ensure fair and equitable allocation of shares to investors and prevent recurrence of trading malpractices.

NSE Vice-Chairman Paul Mwai said the use of electronic processes in IPOs will hasten transactions, reduce costs and eliminate challenges related to refunds.

""Electronic IPOs are more efficient. You know the IPO process is quite cumbersome -- that is the reconciliation process and the refunds process and all those kinds of things. If this process can be automated, it becomes quite quicker and cleaner. It is very welcome.

It also gives you an opportunity, in some cases, what they do is you can actually do a first come, first served basis and help to eliminate the issues of refunds,"" Mr Mwai said.

""But the problem is that not all Kenyan investors are tech-savvy, but they can be assisted in terms of the brokers and the agents can help them to put the electronic applications.""

Electronic IPOs give firms the opportunity to trade through the Internet or in other electronic or automated means or media, wholly or partially, where investors subscribe to the offer of securities by submitting applications electronically or the applications and allotments are processed and completed electronically.

Last year, Uganda became the first country in the East African region to conduct an electronic IPO through the offer of Airtel Uganda shares to the public.

This made it easier for foreign investors, including residents of other East African countries, to participate in the transaction.

In 2008, Kenya's CMA allowed partial use of electronic means in the Safaricom IPO -- only in the application process.

Through a gazette notice, CMA said firms seeking to offer shares in an electronic format will be required to ensure that the information memorandum is disclosed in the same form and content approved by the regulator.

The results of the electronic offer will also be published in the same manner as the information memorandum.

""An issuer of securities shall establish and disclose in the information memorandum a fair and equitable allocation policy for the allocation of the securities in a public offer,"" CMA said.

""An issuer of securities shall establish mechanisms for sensitisation of investors to invest in the issue of the issuer's securities."" Issuers will also be required to notify the CMA and, where there is a listing, the NSE at least 24 hours before the publication of the result of the offer.

Beyond IPOs, automated processes have recently been applied in major transactions as companies and investors take advantage of technology to increase convenience and cut costs.

Investors, for instance, last year had the option of tendering their shares electronically to ICEA Lion Asset Management Ltd when it acquired 36.58 million shares of property fund Ilam Fahari I-Reit.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.",mvariety.com,news,Marianas Variety News & Views,Reuters,0.1372549019607843,448953575,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mvariety.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/2e/f2e1ce78-e99b-11ee-acfb-4f453f1e26e5/65ffb4b77a135.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 30.4% over the same period. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 30%.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank still plans to cut rates this year, perhaps as much as three times, expecting inflation to be sustainably on its way to 2 % per year.

There appears to be consensus that the first reduction will take place in June.

And sure enough, the shares then skyrocketed.

If you search the Internet, you will find many prognosticators claiming that tech stocks are in a bubble and that a crash or at least a significant pullback is imminent.

Given the strong recovery since October, this concern is understandable.

However, so far, markets as a whole are not buying into these fears.

What we often hear is enthusiasm for everything related to artificial intelligence. The Bulls say the development of AI represents the biggest technological change since the advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s.

And AI may be sparking a surge not unlike what we saw in the late 1990s.

2024 is also a presidential election year, where stocks typically rise about 6%.

That helps explain why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 indexes hit record highs on Thursday, while the Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 indexes hit record closes on Friday.

This fuels interest in Reddit (RDDT) . The social media company went public at $34 late Wednesday, and its shares jumped 48% to $50.44 Thursday, its first day of trading. On Friday, however, Reddit rose 8.8% to $46.

Perhaps the worst scenario that can be found among those who have observed the markets is that of Jeffrey Hirsch, editor in chief of The Stock Traders' Almanac.

Hirsch thinks stocks could stagnate over the next few months because it's time. Stocks typically see their best gains between November and April and take a break until the fall, he notes.

Jon Markman, a Seattle Financial Planner who is bullish on the foreseeable future, likes small-cap stocks in general and the iShares Russell 2000 exchange fund (IWM) and energy stocks for the rest of the year.

What's happening this week

This week could provide a hint of what's to come, as investors and traders will have to make decisions largely outside of major market-moving events. It's a four-day week as US markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So if momentum is driving markets, you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before first-quarter trading ends. It's Thursday.

The only report investors should pay attention to

The Commerce Department releases its monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report Friday morning.

PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge because it measures changes in the price of things people actually buy.

The scam. The sensus estimate predicts that the index will show a monthly increase of 0.4% in February, compared to 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, FXStreet projects. This suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization of price increases will be rocky.

Economists have been low on inflation estimates lately. Surprisingly high inflation numbers of late have led Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street interpreted this to mean that rates would fall. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Saturday refused to immediately hear a petition filed by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal against his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the money laundering case linked to the alleged excise policy scam.

The court will hear the petition on March 27 after the Holi.

Kejriwal's legal team had sought an immediate hearing.

In his plea, the Delhi CM contended that his arrest and the remand order passed by a trial court were illegal and that he was entitled to be released from custody immediately.

The ED, which was given the custody of Delhi CM till March 28 by the court, has alleged that the Aam Adami Party (AAP) is the major beneficiary of the proceeds of crime generated in the alleged liquor scam.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has said that Kejriwal is the ""kingpin and key conspirator"" in the now-scrapped excise policy case in collusion with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ministers, leaders and other persons.

Kejriwal, who was sent to ED custody on Friday by a Delhi court till March 28, was directly involved in the conspiracy of formulation of the excise policy to ""favour certain persons"" and also involved in the ""demanding kickbacks from liquor businessmen"" in exchange of favours granting in the said policy, the probe agency claimed.

The policy in question was being drafted considering the favours to be granted to the 'South Group' and was formed in collusion with Vijay Nair, Manish Sisodia, and members-representatives of the 'South Group'.

""Therefore, not only the AAP but Arvind Kejriwal shall be deemed to be guilty of offences punishable under Section 4 of PMLA and shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished as provided u/s 70 of PMLA,"" the agency said.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding US$3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum, calling for steps to improve the sustainability of the property sector, reduce debt risks and focus more on domestic consumption.

Decisive steps to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and giving more space for market-based corrections in the property sector could accelerate a solution to current property sector problems and boost consumer and investor confidence, she said.

Premier Li Qiang said in his latest official remarks on the housing sector on Friday that China would further optimise property policy. Earlier this month, Li announced an annual growth goal of around 5% this year, a target some analysts said was ambitious.

China also needs to rely more on domestic consumption, Georgieva said. It can do so by raising incomes, boosting families' spending power and expanding the social security system, including the pension system, in a ""fiscally responsible way"".

China should establish a robust AI regulatory framework, Georgieva said, noting that China leads emerging economies in terms of AI preparedness.

China's industry ministry in January issued draft guidelines for standardising the AI industry, with the aim to have national and industry-wide standards in place by 2026.

China has ""enormous potential in advancing the green economy,"" Georgieva said. While China leads in deployment of renewable energy it needs to sell a greater share of electricity at market prices, to decarbonise more efficiently, she said. She also recommended China expand its emissions trading system (ETS) to the industrial sector.

Millions of farmers have been lining up at various National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots across the country to collect subsidized fertiliser.

While there are teething problems and some delays here and there, the certainty of getting the fertiliser overshadows them.

The deployment of technology in reaching farmers will remain one of President William Ruto's landmark Bottom Up Policy.

This mode of fertiliser distribution presents the first real disruption of the Economic Systems that had for decades strangled the economic well-being of the majority of Kenyans.

Before the introduction of the novel distribution system, most government subsidy programs ended up benefiting a few characters.

For instance, exactly 10 years ago, in March 2014, former president Uhuru announced that 143,000 Metric Tonnes of fertiliser worth Sh7.2 billion had been purchased.

These tonnes were to be distributed countrywide under the Government's fertilizer subsidy programme.

He said the cost of a 50-kilogram bag of DAP fertiliser will retail at Sh2, 000 down from Sh2,480, NPR fertiliser at Sh2,000 down from Sh2,300, CAN at Sh1,500 instead of Sh1,600 while a 50-kilogram bag of Urea fertiliser was to be sold at Sh1, 500 instead of Sh1,800.

But immediately after the announcement and the flagging off of the fertiliser in a mega press event beamed live on TV, little was heard about the fertilizer. The prices remained the same, if not higher.

This was due to open diversion by fertiliser cartels.

When the 2014 direct subsidy failed to work, the Government partnered with a mobile Service provider in 2015.

The mobile service provider and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries embarked on the pilot of a joint initiative that aimed at empowering farmers with access to a technology-based solution for the distribution of fertiliser and other key inputs.

The solution, named 'E-fertiliser Subsidy Management System', was an electronic vouchering solution that was specially developed for the Ministry by the giant telco.

It allowed farmers to access vouchers via their mobile phones.

It intended to also enable the Government to plan future requirements in terms of fertiliser types and quantities

The vouchers were to be used by the farmers to access Government fertiliser at subsidized prices.

""Traditionally, the process of getting subsidies to farmers has been time intensive and inefficient as there was no single way to reach them all effectively. Our solution, should the pilot be successful, will allow us to increase transparency in the allocation of fertilizer to over 3.5 million small-holder farmers across the country using mobile phones,"" Sicily Kariuki, then Principal Secretary, State Department of Agriculture said during the launch

E-Fertiliser Subsidy leveraged data and SMS services to manage the issuance, redemption and reconciliation of vouchers on behalf of the Ministry input subsidization intervention program.

The solution offered simple reporting capabilities to improve decision support for the Ministry, which was charged with distributing fertiliser inputs to farmers across the country.

But the brilliant initiative by the giant telco had one big problem, raw data was not there.

That is what the initiative led by Interior PS Dr Raymond Omollo solved.

In just one Month PS Omollo led a nationwide registration of farmers, a feat that captured 4.6 million of them.

Unlike other Government initiatives, PS Omollo started by training more than 70,000 national administration workers, from village elders, chiefs, assistants, and deputy and county commissioners on the rationale of registering farmers.

Village elders and assistant chiefs verified the actual size of land owned by each farmer before forwarding details to the chiefs and assistant county commissioners.

For the first time, a solution was found, a solution that locked out all unscrupulous dealers who took advantage of the lack of data to profit from the subsidy program.",the-star.co.ke,news,The Star,,-0.0117647058823529,448953256,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NpJsuBIbShSsCy_R2wirWhYOILoGfAtmcjXscce_tbjXaL8TdVDH5cByQoXPqAIjrdm6CX8Diiw3ItJkU93fvM8bEPAU1Hk8SRfHWQzQ=s1000,

(Image: pexels)

India was recently ranked as the fifth largest economy in the world, with a US$ 3,730 billion worth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and an annual GDP growth rate of 5.9%. The country has witnessed extensive economic growth since the liberation of the Indian market in the early 1990s, paving the way for monumental growth and opportunities for the world's largest democracy. With the advent of more recent efforts, such as the Make in India initiative we see a tremendous increase in the total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows over the past nine financial years (2014 to 2023), amounting to US$ 596 billion - a 100% increase over the previous nine years (US$ 298 billion for a period of 2005-2014).

Further, India jumped from the 142 position in 2014 to the 63 position in 2020 in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Ranking 2020, suggesting India's rise as a global hotspot for foreign investors. Despite India's glowing economic rapport on the global front, the collective labour productivity decreased by 2.53% YoY in December 2022, indicating a dire need to focus attention towards enhancing productivity to improve operational efficiency across industries.

Inefficient Operations = Insufficient Innovations

Over the past decade, through an extensive focus on the manufacturing industry, there has been a thrust on the growth of key industries in India, broadening the country's economic landscape across a plethora of industries, and paving the way for new frontiers. The gems and jewellery industry, for instance, is one of the largest and fastest-growing businesses in India, contributing to the country's GDP growth by 7%.

Moreover, the increasing trend of lab-grown diamonds in India as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substitute for natural diamonds has further skyrocketed the gems and jewellery industry. Similarly, the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry, poised to reach US$ 65 billion in 2024, has contributed to its role as the third largest pharmaceutical producer by volume, providing affordable and quality-assured medicines. With the increasing focus on evolving healthcare via innovative therapies, integration of technology in manufacturing, and optimising supply chain processes, the pharmaceutical industry is projected to grow up to US$ 130 billion by 2030.

While we notice an increasing popularity of the manufacturing industry - which contributes to nearly 17% of the GDP - India still famously remains a service-focused economy, which contributes to nearly 50% of the country's GDP. To improve India's manufacturing capabilities to meet its ambitious goals, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce emphasises on the need to increase the sector GDP contribution to 20%, further encouraging India to play a larger role in the global manufacturing domain.

To further encourage the manufacturing sector in India, it is pertinent to recognise the key areas of importance to boost operational efficiency across businesses. One such often overlooked attribute is productivity. While several tools exist to measure growth and identify the challenges within an industry, there are limited resources available to measure a business's productivity. Inefficient productivity dictates an organisation's operational efficiency, costs, delivery times, manufacturing, and profitability, thereby impeding innovative strategies when it's most needed. Inadequate productivity could be largely attributed to insufficient performance management, outdated technologies, low employee engagement, insufficient skilling programs for on-ground teams, extensive use of temporary and casual labour in a large cross-section of Indian factories and inaccurate forecasting.

Solutions

To bolster India's position as a global competitor in an ever-evolving market, organisations must identify their weak links to further develop robust innovations and operational efficiency. To begin with, analysing current operations and identifying waste could aid organisations in strategizing effective standardised procedures to strengthen both quality and productivity.

Additionally, the utilisation of advanced technologies by integrating automation and infrastructural advancements could further eliminate human errors while increasing productivity across all departments. According to a recent study, over 90% of the workers surveyed noted that automation not only increased their productivity but also reduced errors and helped with quicker decision-making.

Further, opting for a lean approach, such as Value Stream Mapping to develop enhanced workflow strategies could aid organisations in optimising operations without additional resources. Regular reviews and subsequent updates of operational processes can streamline operational costs and eliminate waste, paving the way for the implementation of more innovative strategies and potential savings along the process.

To harbour a spirit of innovation, organisations need to define their growth segments and subsequently identify key markers such as market presence, and changing trends, so as to develop practical strategies for implementation.

A business cannot thrive without innovation; however, it is crucial to recognise that innovation cannot thrive without operational excellence. To ensure India's growth on the global stage as a competent competitor, we have to modernise our labour laws, embrace opportunities offered by Industry 4.0 & AI, enhance operational efficiencies, and leverage the opportunities offered by this 'Amrit Kaal' of India's history.

TMC leaders like Mausam Benazir Noor and Babun Banerjee have expressed dissatisfaction over denied tickets, while BJP's Arjun Singh returned to the party after being denied a ticket. Both parties downplayed the dissent, with the TMC citing disappointment rather than discontent. The TMC dropped seven incumbents and nominated 26 fresh faces, while the BJP aims to win over 35 seats in the state.Discontentment seems to be increasing by the day in sections of the BJP and the TMC in West Bengal with several leaders of both camps expressing displeasure over the selection of candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection.

At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets.

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla.

Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal will be held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1.

Sukhdeav Singh, 58, sold fake branded trainers and boots at Rye Market.

Last February, Singh pleaded guilty to 13 counts relating to trademark theft.

He had counterfeit footwear he planned to sell that would have a retail value of more than £170,000 if they were genuine.

Following last year's prosecution, East Sussex Trading Standards began proceedings against Singh under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover assets and cash obtained through his criminal activities.

At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing on March 11 this year at Lewes Crown Court, Singh was made the subject of a confiscation order.

Singh, of City Way in Rochester, Kent, was ordered to pay a total of £60,000 within three months. Any default of payment could result in up to six months' imprisonment.

Judge Mark Van Der Zwart said: ""The particular criminal conduct amounted to £60,000 and the defendant had available assets in this sum.""

Andy Clooney, Trading Standards team manager at East Sussex County Council, said: ""The sale of counterfeit goods harms legitimate sales and damages consumer confidence.

""This individual not only tricked people into paying for inferior goods, his actions also had a detrimental effect on genuine traders and the manufacturers whose products he claimed to be selling.

""This confiscation order should send a clear message that we will do everything in our power to disrupt the sale of illegal goods in our county and take back the profits from these crimes.""

Singh was originally sentenced in March last year to a four-month custodial sentence suspended for one year to run concurrently on each of the 13 counts to which he pleaded guilty and 80 hours of unpaid work.

He was also made to pay full prosecution costs of £1,110.

We also shared stories about how innovative technologies are helping shape our world and nation every day. These topics are extremely important, but today we'll explore the technology used in the most important mission on earth: saving lives.

A few years ago, I wrote about how drone technology was impacting several industries. While the column focused on real estate, media, and even food delivery, this story is about drones and how the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office used drone technology to save a young girl's life.

Last month, a Tampa girl was reported missing from her home late one afternoon. She was only 5 years old and she was autistic.

The forest near her house quickly turned into a swamp, and had this situation continued into the evening, the outcome might have been very different.

Local authorities with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office sent a drone unit to search for her on the ground and in the air, along with police officers. They tracked her heat signature using thermal imagery from a high-flying drone. Then it was a matter of communicating the coordinates of that heat signature to police officers on the ground. Police officers and the rapid deployment of drone technology are nothing less than heroes to that girl and her family. Their actions showed law enforcement agencies across the country how to do it. Some clips of the rescue are online.

What happens if I fall off the boat in bad weather? Can technology help save you from drowning? Yes, it can, as we saw last year in Walton County when a man fell from a boat and his wife called 911 for help. be.

Dispatch officers used a technology tool called Rapid Deploy to find the man's choppy, floating trajectory, but the wife quickly lost sight of him. Meanwhile, the dispatcher moved the boat to her wife, informed her that she was being tracked by the track provided by the app, and found her wife.

This technology gives dispatch teams the tools to respond faster, smarter, and most importantly, save lives.

I've personally never been a fan of smartwatches. Years ago, I wrote a column about them, but decided they weren't for me.

The Apple Watch has been credited with saving many lives over the years, so perhaps I wasn't focusing on the benefits of wearable devices. Last year, a grandmother in Boca Raton was getting ready for bed one night when she felt much better. Her watch did not match, alerting her to a life-threatening situation. Her heart readings, tracked by her watch, were off the charts. She called her neighbor to tell him, he called 911, and her life was saved.

This story was captured by Good Morning America.

Perhaps the Apple Watch and other wearables are certainly a good investment, especially for people who live alone.

On the artificial intelligence front, much media this year focused on panic, negativity, and even musicians outraged about fake AI music.

But when you look at AI in healthcare, the story quickly tilts in a positive direction. Delray Medical Center in Florida is now using artificial intelligence tools to save lives. They can use an app called Viz Vascular that reviews CT scans to find things like aneurysms and pulmonary embolisms.

Once that is complete, the app will send an alert to your medical team before the actual report is processed. These types of diagnoses can mean life or death in getting the patient back for treatment as soon as possible.

Who doesn't want extra eyes on their chart? In particular, it is a computer eye that has integrated all of humanity's medical knowledge into its brain.

The applications and uses of technology go far beyond what we see: offices, clouds, airlines, cybercrime, factories, the Internet of Things, smart cars, music, Netflix, elections, ordering food, etc. .

Technology is about to evolve.

These stories today are just the beginning as we enter what I predict will be a new golden age for humanity.

Technology is nothing to fear, but the apocalypse narrative is inadequate and short-sighted.

I prefer a positive outlook. Think of it this way. Technology can be the ally that humanity needs to live safely and lead society to a brighter future.

Do you think it's far-fetched?

Technology doesn't cause wars; we start them. Technology can be used to make the world a better place.

All we have to do is make sure it is used properly. It may be a lot of hard work for all of us, but it won't happen overnight.

However, I believe that in the coming decades, our society will reach unprecedented heights of progress, innovation, and peace.

As Sarah Connor once said, ""There is no destiny, there is only what we make of it."" Game on.

But the 9:30 p.m. Eastern time slot after ""Abbott"" has had a rerun of that show or ""Celebrity Family Feud."" Why did ABC cancel a good, very funny show like ""Home Economics"" when it would have been a perfect fit after ""Abbott Elementary""?

A: ABC did try the comedy starring Topher Grace in that time slot, without great success. By the end of its third season, the Hollywood Reporter said, the show "" had the smallest Nielsen-measured audience among the five ABC comedies that aired during the regular September-to-May season in 2022-23.""

Q: What can you tell me about the show I remember called ""It's About Time""? It was a comedy about astronauts who travel back in time to the era of cave men.

A: ""It's About Time,"" as the theme song said, ""It's about space, about two men in the strangest place ..."" And thanks for pulling that out of my memory banks. The show originally aired on CBS for a single season in 1966-67. At first it had two astronauts (played by Jack Mullaney and Frank Aletter) accidentally transported back in time, where they encountered a Stone Age tribe (Imogene Coca, Joe E. Ross, Mike Mazurki and others). It was not a hit and midway through the season the astronauts got back to the present day -- with some of the tribe accompanying them. That didn't bring any more viewers. But we'll always have that song.

Q: If I remember right, in the 1960s TV series ""Lost in Space,"" Dr. Smith stowed away on the Robinson family's spaceship. Who is the actor who played his character? I heard quite a while ago that he was an accomplished Broadway actor. Is this true?

A: Jonathan Harris played the ever-amusing Dr. Zachary Smith, who sabotaged the Jupiter II and set the Robinson family on its three-season TV journey in 1965-68. When Harris died in 2002, his New York Times obituary mentioned ""Lost in Space"" first among his credits, as did the Los Angeles Times' obit. He had done stage work -- the L.A. Times said his early career included 125 plays with stock companies around the country, and his Broadway debut in 1942 was followed by several more plays. But the bulk of his work was in TV, both as an actor in various shows and as a voice actor in animated productions.

Q: Can you tell me anything about ""Rising Damp""? I think it was on PBS perhaps in the late '60s. It starred Frances de la Tour, who later appeared on Broadway.

A: The comedy, a British import carried by public TV stations here, originally aired from 1974 to 1978, with a movie following. Leonard Rossiter starred as the grouchy landlord of a shabby house; de La Tour was an especially interesting tenant. It was funny, although I admired Rossiter more in another '70s comedy, ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.""

Conducted in September 2023, the report tapped into the perspectives of 673 hiring professionals across various industries and company sizes.

Optimism runs high for the first half of 2024, with 45% of hirers confident to have a ""more active"" job market this year. However, expectations slightly taper off for the latter half of the year, with only 32% remaining confident about the job market.

Looking ahead, nearly half of the respondents (49%) revealed plans to boost their workforce in the initial half of 2024. Additionally, 3 out of 10 hirers are gearing up to increase their teams with contract or temporary staff, citing reasons such as business expansion (54%) and challenges in recruiting full-time employees (34%).

Additionally, over 52% of the surveyed companies have engaged in salary benchmarking initiatives to ensure equitable remuneration. Notably, 26% of hirers factor in inflation when calculating salary increments.

In 2023, more companies distributed bonuses to their employees, although only 49% disclosed their bonus calculation methods. Salary increments, however, saw a dip, with the average increase resting at 5.8%, compared to 6.3% in 2022.

Despite this, staff promotions experienced a notable uptick, with 59% of companies facilitating career advancement opportunities, offering an average increment of 9.24%.

Special Leaves

Companies offering birthday leave increased by 4% last year, and this trend is expected to continue. This indicates a high priority for birthday leave and family care leave, both at 9%.

Additionally, there's a growing emphasis on extending additional paternity and maternity leave, with percentages of 8% and 7%, respectively, reflecting a focus on employee well-being and family support.

Employee Benefits

Health checks/medical screening coverage took the lead in 2023 at 6%, followed by medical insurance and dental coverage at 5% each.

Looking ahead, health checks and medical coverage are a sustained priority, alongside a growing interest in flexible benefits that cater to individual needs and preferences.

Accommodation

While not commonly offered, accommodation rental reimbursement is the most prevalent benefit among companies that provide accommodation perks.

Career Development

More companies also focus on upskilling employees through training/self-learning programmes and job rotation, at 4%. The future outlook indicates a focus on these programmes, with 9% of companies planning to provide such initiatives.

Work-life Balance

New benefits introduced in 2023 include flexible working hours (5%) and free snacks/beverages/fruits (4%).

Flexible workplace arrangements and organizational activities are anticipated to remain key focus areas in 2024 as companies strive to enhance employee work-life balance and well-being.

Family-Friendly Benefits

Plans to extend work activities/events to family members and provide nursing rooms at the workplace are expected to materialise in 2024, creating inclusive and family-friendly work environments.

Other benefits

While transportation allowances within the country continue to be common, there's a growing consideration for introducing allowances for work outside the country, indicating a potential resurgence in business travel.

However, uncertainty looms for 2024, especially among companies adhering to a fully return-to-office arrangement.

Employees are increasingly preferring flexible workplace options, prompting companies to reevaluate their working arrangements to attract and retain talent.

Remote Work Support

Laptops for employees and virtual meeting support remain crucial forms of remote working support.

Companies are expected to prioritise providing work-from-home guidelines and allowances for remote work setups to ensure employee productivity.

Poor mental health is increasingly common in Singapore. While most hirers (76%) rated their companies as moderately stressful, with level 5 being the most common rating (25%), approximately 16% of workplaces are considered highly stressful.

Although mental health is becoming more and more non-negotiable in this generation, only 38% of hirers believe their organisations do enough to help employees handle stress, showing room for improvement.

Yet, 34% of companies started new well-being initiatives in 2023. More mental health talks were held, but 35% of companies only did so once a year, suggesting ongoing improvement is needed. /TISG

(We are showing the world and our allies that we are trying to moderate our behavior. We do not want to provoke but these are the implications of our policy- we don't want to further intensify the situation despite the fact that we are the ones being blamed by China.)

De Castro said the Philippines should prepare for China's expansionist plans as it attempts to gain more territory.

""Nagdi-deliver ng speech si President Xi Jinping sa kanyang mga kasundalohan, the People's Liberation Army at lagi niyang hinuhumok na maghanda tayo. Ewan ko lang ho sa panahon o taong ho ito na nangyayari na routine, iba na ho. Hindi na ho itong nangyayari na routine or symbolic . Kumbaga sinasabihan na niya na maghanda at may binabalak ho sila,"" the analyst said.

(In his speeches, President Xi Jinping exhorts his troops in the People's Liberation Army to be prepared. We don't know if this time or year, it's routine. It's different now. This is no longer routine or symbolic. In effect, he is telling them to get ready since they are planning something.)

De Castro said he does not discount China in making good on its plans but advised the Philippines not to be cough flat-footed when it does.

""Hindi ko dini-discount ho iyun. Kung ganun ho ang iniisip ng mga Tsino maghanda na din ho tayo. Huwag ho tayong matakot o mag despair, kundi maghanda ho tayo,"" he said.

(I do not discount China's plans. If that's the way the Chinese are thinking we should be preparing ourselves. We should not be afraid or despair but instead we should be prepared.)

In light of this, De Castro said National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano has requested Executive Lucas Bersamin and the National Security Cluster to formulate a recommendation to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. after developments in the West Philippine Sea.

""Magkakaroon po ng meeting ngayong Monday. Nagrequest ho si National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano ng meeting ng Cluster E. Pag uusapan ho kung itutuloy ba, ganyan pa ba ang procedure o magbabago ng ilang taktika ho,"" he said. -- RF, GMA Integrated News",gmanetwork.com,news,GMA Network,,0.05098039215686279,448952217,1,https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/03/Screenshot_2024-03-23_at_9_2024_03_23_09_55_58.png,eng-9420479

Panitanki is located around 30km from here. The fire erupted around 5.30am.

Fire tenders from different locations in Siliguri subdivision and even one from Nepal reached the spot and controlled the fire after three hours.

Arun Ghosh, the sabhadhipati of the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad, said: ""We visited the spot. As the model code of conduct is in force, it is not immediately possible to release funds to compensate the affected shop owners. The Kharibari BDO is assessing the loss so that relief can be given to traders according to guidelines.""

The gutted shops are grocery outlets, garment shops, eateries and a motor repair garage.

Officials and personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) that guards the Nepal border also reached the spot and began firefighting and rescue measures.

SSB sources said as the blaze was reported near the Raniganj immigration office building in Panitanki, officers and personnel from the Panitanki and Gaursinghbusty border outposts rushed there.

Fire tenders from Naxalbari, Siliguri, and Matigara reached the spot. The SSB spoke with officials of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force (APF) Nepal and arranged a fire engine from Mechinagar, Nepal.

During firefighting, the SSB and the APF, Nepal, restricted the movement of people from Nepal to India on the old Mechi river bridge of Panitanki checkpost for the smooth movement of fire engines and for the SSB to be deployed to help.

""The fire started from an electrical short circuit in the wires hanging over the shops. It spread quickly because of inflammable materials like motor oil and LPG cylinders. Eventually, it was doused at 8.30am,"" said a source in SSB.

During that time, the SSB cordoned off the burning shops, managed traffic and prevented crowding.

They helped firefighters contain the fire and recovered and saved properties from burning shops.

Later in the day, Gopal Lama, the Trinamul candidate of the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat, visited the spot with Papiya Ghosh, the Darjeeling (plains) district Trinamul president. He spoke to the affected traders.

Mayor smoke meeting

Siliguri mayor Gautam Deb held a meeting with officials of the state fire services department on Saturday and discussed measures to prevent forest fire near the city.

Recently, such fires led to smoke engulfing Siliguri in the evenings and nights.

""The sudden downpour over the past couple of days has doused the fires in the forest and the dumping ground,"" said Deb.

An effective approach would be to harness social media platforms as tools for upskilling and self-marketing.

Using Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok or any other social media platform, jobseekers can empower themselves to acquire and hone new skills, demonstrate their expertise and connect with potential employers.

Here are a few ways for jobseekers to get a head start:

Building professional online presence

In a 2020 Harris poll, 71% of employment decision-makers believed that reviewing candidates' social media profiles is an effective screening method, with 67% acknowledging the use of social networking sites for researching potential job candidates.

While this poll focused on the US job market, similar practices are prevalent among Malaysian recruiters. Therefore, establishing a professional online presence is paramount for jobseekers.

Social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, provide an excellent avenue for jobseekers to showcase their skills, experience and accomplishments.

Jobseekers can optimize their profile by incorporating relevant keywords, highlighting their achievements and presenting their portfolio or work samples.

Networking and building connections

Social media platforms offer a broad network of professionals spanning diverse industries. Jobseekers can leverage these platforms to establish connections with industry experts, mentors and recruiters.

Participating in conversations, engaging in industry-related discussions and seeking advice from experienced professionals can assist jobseekers in broadening their networks as well as enabling them to acquire valuable insights and uncover new job opportunities.

Joining industry-specific communities

Many social media platforms feature communities or groups dedicated to specific industries or professions. Joining these communities will enable jobseekers to access valuable resources, stay updated on industry trends and seize networking opportunities.

Engaging in discussions, sharing knowledge and seeking guidance within these communities will not only contribute to their upskilling, but also demonstrate their passion and commitment to their chosen fields.

Showcasing skills and expertise

Social media platforms provide various mediums for showcasing skills and expertise. For example, jobseekers can create and share informative blog posts, articles related to their industry or even create video content.

By consistently providing valuable content, jobseekers can establish credibility and position themselves as a knowledgeable professional in their fields. This will help them to attract potential employers, and demonstrate a proactive approach towards personal and professional development.

Leveraging online learning opportunities

Social media platforms are a treasure trove of online learning opportunities. Many industry experts, influencers and organizations offer webinars, workshops and online courses that can help jobseekers to acquire new skills or enhance existing ones.

Actively participating in these learning opportunities showcases a jobseeker's willingness to learn and adapt, making them more appealing to potential employers.

Jobseekers can stay updated on the latest trends and insights in their field by following and interacting with industry influencers and thought leaders on these platforms. This will not only demonstrate their genuine interest in the industry but also help them build valuable connections, opening doors to new opportunities.

Jobseekers should also consider participating in online challenges or competitions related to their field. These events will provide a chance for them to showcase their skills and offer exposure to potential employers and industry professionals.

In a nutshell

In a challenging job market, jobseekers need to find innovative ways to set themselves apart. Social media platforms provide a unique opportunity for upskilling and self-marketing.

By building a professional online presence, connecting with industry professionals, joining industry-specific communities, demonstrating skills and expertise and leveraging online learning opportunities, jobseekers can enhance their chances of success.

Utilizing the capabilities of social media will enable jobseekers to enhance their skills and market themselves effectively, thereby boosting their visibility and appeal to potential employers.",thesun.my,news,thesun.my,,0.2549019607843137,448951963,1,https://thesun.my/binrepository/484x250/2c0/480d250/none/11808/XFCQ/startup-business_3982682_20240324124230.jpg,

Peter Uzoho and Oluchi Chibuzor

The federal government has charged all the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country to be ready to receive and distribute not less than 6,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the next six months.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, who stated this, also announced the government's plan to secure funding ranging from N250 billion to N300 billion to close the over seven million metering gap in the country on an annual basis over the next four to five years.

He explained that the government intended to raise that fund through a N75-billion seed capital to be provided by President Bola Tinubu's administration, along with additional debt capital injections from the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

Adelabu revealed these at the weekend when he visited Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) in Lagos and the Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited (MEMMCOL) in Ogun State.

He revealed that a bill for legislation to replicate local content law in the power sector was underway.

Speaking at the Eko Disco office, Adelabu said the charge to the Discos to be prepared to uptake 6,100MW became necessary after the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) successfully conducted system stress tests, where it demonstrated its ability to transmit over 8,100MW, alongside the proposed plans for a partial Sovereign Risk Guarantee (SRG) to enhance generation companies' (Gencos) capacity.

With Eko and Ikeja Discos having exceeded a specified threshold through improved collection efficiency and service quality, Adelabu said he had unveiled a strategic plan to utilise the two Discos as model Discos to pilot test the anticipated effective supply to be implemented sector-wide in the next few months.

He said the two Discos would serve as a standard for emulation by others.

However, at the MEMMCOL meter plant in Ogun, Adelabu also stated that in line with President Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, the government was targeting to provide about 2.5 million prepaid meters every year to close the nation's metering gap.

This, he said, would help the government in the promotion of import substitution policy of locally-made products in the power sector and encourage backward integration in the areas of technical training.

He equally expressed the current administration's commitment to support local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by working on a bill that would promote local content for the power sector.

""We have a Presidential Metering Initiative that has the target of installing a minimum of two million to 2.5 million meters every year for the next five years, for us to close the huge metering gap that we currently have in the power sector.

""Even if we cannot close it 100 per cent as there will be new connections, we have to reduce it significantly and the government cannot do it alone. We have to do it jointly with all parties because we all contributed to the decay in the sector and we must also contribute to reversing the decay"", the minister stated.

He maintained that the initiatives would encourage investors to risk their equity and debt capital to establish local industries.

""In the power sector, it is our choice to have significant local content in our projects and our contracts. We are trying to work on a bill now that will legislate local content for the power sector just like we have in our oil and gas. That is the only way we can sustain local producers. So, that is the reason I am here.""

In his earlier briefings to the minister, the Chairman of MEMMCOL, Mr. Kola Balogun, thanked Adelabu for the courage and commitment he had shown so far to reverse the ugly trends in the power sector

Balogun, however, noted that the demand for prepaid meters in Nigeria surpasses the volume of other countries in Africa, noting that local patronage was still needed for them to meet the investment threshold.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.09019607843137245,448951864,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/power-sector.jpeg,

A waterfront mansion has hit the market in Australia and it's poised to become a record-breaker for the city of Brisbane.

The six-bedroom home in the suburb of Hawthorne is known as Mimosa and potential buyers have until April 16 to make their top offers on the contemporary residence that sits alongside the Brisbane River.

""We have no doubt Mimosa will break the Brisbane price record,"" said listing agent Sarah Hackett, Place New Farm. ""This truly is Brisbane's most desirable estate,"" she added. ""In my decades in real estate, there certainly is not a home like it.""

The city's current record was set last year when a 130-year-old property sold for a whopping A$20.5 million (US$13.47 million).

The name of the home might be considered unusual to some, but Mimosa was the name of the original building that was on the land for a long time, according to Hackett.

""The owners decided to continue on the name, as it encapsulates the Queensland lifestyle; sitting along the property's iconic riverfront bar and enjoying a champagne and orange mimosa,"" she said.

The seller, a business owner, couldn't be reached for comment. Mansion Global couldn't determine how much he acquired the property for.

The home is loaded with high-end amenities inside and out.

Its interiors boast towering ceilings, bespoke New Guinea rosewood joinery and a travertine staircase. There's an open-plan living and dining area with timber-clad ceilings and a temperature-controlled wine cellar; a gym; a media room; a library with a balcony; and one of ""the best gourmet kitchens I've ever seen,"" Hackett said.

Outside, there are low-maintenance gardens; an in-ground heated swimming pool with a hot tub; a pool house with an outdoor bar equipped with two bar fridges, two dishwashers, an ice machine and a custom beer tap;  a flood-lit, full-size tennis court; and a private 20-meter pontoon.

In Brisbane, ""the river lifestyle is highly appealing,"" Hackett said. The city council has invested in marina berths around the city, ""allowing a prospective buyer to pull up by boat to bars, restaurants, the farmers markets and even a sandy white island with crystal clear blue waters from their own jetty.""",mansionglobal.com,news,Mansion Global,Liz Lucking,0.1843137254901961,448951826,1,https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-43264051/social,

As the industry evolves, the integration of modern technology is reshaping education and traditional practices, thereby opening new avenues. From the integration of advanced software such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and 3D printing to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), aspiring designers are finding that digital tools are Navigating a situation that is becoming more prevalent. increasingly indispensable.

creative vision

Traditionally, interior design has been synonymous with the creative act of conceptualizing beautiful spaces. Harmony of color, material and style. This reductive perception of the profession has its roots in the rise of famous interior decorators in the 1920s, such as Elsie de Wolfe and Dorothy Draper. However, in today's era, as design recognizes deep human considerations such as health and spatial justice, the scope of practice requires more than creative vision. Designers also need to have a thorough, evidence-based understanding of how spaces are utilized for specific users.

Software is an invaluable tool when it comes to communicating with clients. AutoCAD has long been used to communicate floor plans and designs, but modern clients often struggle to visualize spaces based solely on technical drawings. Therefore, mastering software for exciting 3D rendering has become essential so that designers can effectively communicate their concepts and facilitate client understanding and approval.

As the serial rendering era evolved, many designers now provide a series of renderings for clients to review before finalizing a design. These renderings are often created using 3D software such as SketchUp, 3DS Max, Lumion, and various software options such as Floorplanner, Foyr, and Cedreo. is available on the market and can be easily tried out through freemium or limited-time free schemes. The recent use of generative AI large-scale learning models (LLMs) such as Dall-E and Midjourney has caused ripples in the industry, bringing both excitement and complexity to interior design. Social media feeds are flooded with amazing images, promising incredibly realistic visuals generated from text descriptions. However, mastering these tools requires an additional skill set similar to that of a prompt engineer: being able to accurately interpret design preferences and specifications, such as achieving a particular color combination or furniture layout. You need the ability to guide the AI.

Cultural Bias The influx of AI-generated designs also raises questions about the impact of cultural bias and datasets on design outcomes. For example, a dataset primarily sourced from the United States may result in an American interpretation, even if you design it for a different cultural context, such as an Indian kitchen. This raises questions about the extent to which the designer is influenced by the dataset and can lead to forms of collaborative design where initial ideas are compromised to fit elements suggested by the software.

Environmental Cost Concerns Despite these advances, challenges still exist. Digital visualizations may seem impressive, but they can contain inaccuracies and impracticalities that only become apparent in the built environment. Additionally, the proliferation of Generative AI has raised concerns about the environmental costs of carbon emissions from widespread use of computing power. Designers may need to consider the sustainability implications of digital practices.

Looking to the future, the role of technology in interior design will continue to evolve. From experimenting with meta brainwave simulations to continually improving AI capabilities, the possibilities are endless. But even amidst the excitement of technological innovation, designers must remain firmly grounded in the fundamental principles of their craft.

After all, the success of an interior environment goes beyond its visual appeal and lies in its practicality and ability to enrich the lives of its inhabitants. As technology continues to shape the interior design landscape, we must explore these advances with mindfulness and a commitment to creating spaces that are both visionary and sustainable. .

Peter Uzoho and Oluchi Chibuzor

The federal government has charged all the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country to be ready to receive and distribute not less than 6,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the next six months.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, who stated this, also announced the government's plan to secure funding ranging from N250 billion to N300 billion to close the over seven million metering gap in the country on an annual basis over the next four to five years.

He explained that the government intended to raise that fund through a N75-billion seed capital to be provided by President Bola Tinubu's administration, along with additional debt capital injections from the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

Adelabu revealed these at the weekend when he visited Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) in Lagos and the Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited (MEMMCOL) in Ogun State.

He revealed that a bill for legislation to replicate local content law in the power sector was underway.

Speaking at the Eko Disco office, Adelabu said the charge to the Discos to be prepared to uptake 6,100MW became necessary after the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) successfully conducted system stress tests, where it demonstrated its ability to transmit over 8,100MW, alongside the proposed plans for a partial Sovereign Risk Guarantee (SRG) to enhance generation companies' (Gencos) capacity.

With Eko and Ikeja Discos having exceeded a specified threshold through improved collection efficiency and service quality, Adelabu said he had unveiled a strategic plan to utilise the two Discos as model Discos to pilot test the anticipated effective supply to be implemented sector-wide in the next few months.

He said the two Discos would serve as a standard for emulation by others.

However, at the MEMMCOL meter plant in Ogun, Adelabu also stated that in line with President Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, the government was targeting to provide about 2.5 million prepaid meters every year to close the nation's metering gap.

This, he said, would help the government in the promotion of import substitution policy of locally-made products in the power sector and encourage backward integration in the areas of technical training.

He equally expressed the current administration's commitment to support local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by working on a bill that would promote local content for the power sector.

""We have a Presidential Metering Initiative that has the target of installing a minimum of two million to 2.5 million meters every year for the next five years, for us to close the huge metering gap that we currently have in the power sector.

""Even if we cannot close it 100 per cent as there will be new connections, we have to reduce it significantly and the government cannot do it alone. We have to do it jointly with all parties because we all contributed to the decay in the sector and we must also contribute to reversing the decay"", the minister stated.

He maintained that the initiatives would encourage investors to risk their equity and debt capital to establish local industries.

""In the power sector, it is our choice to have significant local content in our projects and our contracts. We are trying to work on a bill now that will legislate local content for the power sector just like we have in our oil and gas. That is the only way we can sustain local producers. So, that is the reason I am here.""

In his earlier briefings to the minister, the Chairman of MEMMCOL, Mr. Kola Balogun, thanked Adelabu for the courage and commitment he had shown so far to reverse the ugly trends in the power sector

Balogun, however, noted that the demand for prepaid meters in Nigeria surpasses the volume of other countries in Africa, noting that local patronage was still needed for them to meet the investment threshold.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.04313725490196085,448951645,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/power-sector.jpeg,eng-9420303

The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotosho, said this in a statement to update residents on the return of the markets on Sunday, after their debut on March 17.

The discount markets for foodstuff (Ounje Eko) are part of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu's measures rolled out to cushion the effect of petrol subsidy removal on residents.

Mixed reactions had trailed the prices and other logistics at the markets when residents visited them on their first Sunday of operation.

The pilot scheme began with sales of discounted food items, such as rice, beans, garri, bread, eggs, and perishables like tomato, pepper and onions.

Omotosho said that activities in each market were being coordinated by government officials, youth volunteers and private sector payment solution providers, to ensure seamless operations.

He reiterated that Gov. Sanwo-Olu rolled out the initiative, amongst others, to impact lives in various sectors of the economy.

The commissioner said that a new market location had also been introduced in Lekki Phase 1 to cater to the needs of residents within the area.

He said that the detailed locations of Ounje Èkó markets could be found on all Lagos State Government social media platforms.

Residents had on March 17 trooped out in large numbers to the centres of ""Ounje Eko,"" Lagos Discounted Food programme, to purchase food items at cheaper prices.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that residents arrived as early as 6.00 a.m. at Lagos Progressive Junior Secondary school, Surulere, to benefit from the discounted food programme.

The programme, which was meant to start at 11.00 a.m., started one hour late due to unavailability of vouchers.

Mrs Abimbola Kanwei, 70 year-old, urged the government to adopt a better approach going forward as residents queued under the sun for hours before they could buy the food items.

NAN correspondent, who visited one of the centres in Ikorodu, reports that there were queues of prospective buyers, who were unable to make payment due to the inadequate number of machines.

NAN also reports that activities at the market did not start until 1.00 p.m due to lateness of some officials responsible for collection of money.

Some residents registered their displeasure on the prices of commodities at the discount markets in Badagry.(NAN)",nationalaccordnewspaper.com,news,National Accord Newspaper,,0.1450980392156862,448951639,1,http://www.nationalaccordnewspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/images-2024-03-17T175642.421.jpeg,eng-9421150

The mighty Ford Endeavour, also called the Everest in other countries, is getting attention for its possible return to India. Although it's not certain if and when it will launch, it's important to know that this full-size SUV comes with different features depending on the country it is sold in. In this report, we'll take a closer look at the version of the Endeavour sold in the New Zealand market.

Ford offers two engine options for the Endeavour/Everest in the New Zealand market. The first one is a 3-litre V6 turbo-diesel that makes 250 PS and 600 Nm. The second choice is a smaller 2-litre bi-turbo diesel that produces 210 PS and 500 Nm. Both engines come mated to a 10-speed automatic gearbox and with 4-wheel drive (4x4) only. The Endeavour also gets different driving modes and a locking rear differential to help it perform better when driving off-road. While we'd like a big ol' diesel unit for the Endy in India, the smaller bi-turbo unit might be better for competitive pricing reasons.

The Ford Endeavour comes packed with comfort and convenience features, no matter which country. This New Zealand specification gets wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone climate control, a 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, wireless phone charging, a high-quality 12-speaker B&O sound system, a powered tailgate and ambient lighting. It also gets both heated seats and a heated steering wheel, which of course are left out from the UAE-spec Endeavour.

Comforts limited to the top variant further include the 12.4-inch digital driver's display, power-folding 3rd row seats, matrix LED headlamps, and the semi-autonomous parking assistant.

Safety is a top priority with 9 airbags, electronic stability control, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like Pre-Collision Assist, Lane Keeping System, Reverse Brake Assist, Parking Assist, Hill Descent Control (4X4 only), Load Adaptive Control, Roll Over Mitigation, Traction Control and Trailer Sway Control.

The Ford Endeavour in New-Zealand is retailed in three broad trim levels, namely Trend, Sport and Platinum. Ford offers the Trend and Sport variants with the 2-litre bi-turbo diesel engine only while the Platinum is available exclusively with the 3-litre turbo-diesel engine.

The base Trend variant is equipped with 18-inch wheels, the mid-spec Sport variant gets 20-inch wheels, while the top-spec Platinum gets 21-inch wheels. It is also worth pointing out that the Sport variant gets blacked-out inserts in place of chrome elements on the exterior including the grille and badging.

There's a vivid colour palette to choose from, like Arctic White, Aluminium Metallic, Meteor Grey, Shadow Black, Blue Lightning, Sedona Orange and Equinox Bronze.

It's still uncertain whether the Endeavour will be launched in India, but if it does, it will probably be brought as a completely built unit (CBU) import. This could mean a price range of around Rs 55 lakh to Rs 60 lakh (ex-showroom). It will compete against SUVs like the Toyota Fortuner, MG Gloster, Jeep Meridian, and Skoda Kodiaq.",zigwheels.com,news,ZigWheels.com,,0.1372549019607843,448951477,1,https://media.zigcdn.com/media/content/2024/Mar/cover_65f95f0b954dd.jpg,

Fueled by a need for speed, affordability, and cleaner options, what was once a luxury is now a common sight.

As technology raced forward, tires went from wood to rubber. In the 1800s, pneumatic tires were developed to make cars faster. When natural rubber wasn't enough to scale car production, synthetic rubber came in. Today, rubber has become a major contributor to land pollution, leading the industry to more bio and recyclable options again. Sustainability has become the next big gear shift.

Zero carbon emission cars are the future

Cars and vans rule the pollution charts, at nearly half (48%) of all transport emissions! While electric cars provide a good option for replacing fuel, extraction of lithium for lithium-ion batteries and other critical materials required for batteries has vulnerable supply chains.

Technologies such as lithiation and direct recycling will make the industry's process circular -- making new lithium-ion batteries from end-of-life ones.

Hydrogen will play a critical role in transforming transportation. Big manufacturers are close to launching hydrogen-powered vehicles, and giant investments by Reliance ($75 billion) and Adani ($70 billion) are fueling the race for clean hydrogen production.

Even TATA plans to build buses with Hydrogen fuel cell technology. Truck giant Daimler teamed up with Cummins in 2022 to test hydrogen-powered engines in Freightliner Cascadia trucks for North America.

These fuel cells would leave moisture as automobiles exhaust, making them environmentally friendly. A German aviation firm piloted the world's first liquid hydrogen-powered test flight for 3 hrs in 2023, extending this trend to the aviation sector as well.

Advanced materials will ensure that every part of the car is made from bio or recycled materials

Even with new engines, manufacturing automobile components still adds a carbon footprint. Chemicals and materials derived from petroleum products have been key ingredients, from tires to interiors. OEMs and the entire automobile supply chain network are looking for parts made from recycled or biocontent. Continental Tires, a major tire manufacturing company recently announced to have tires made from 100% recycled content by 2030. In 2022, Volvo released an electric SUV EX90, containing 50kgs of recycled plastics and bio-based materials. In 2023, BMW launched its first vehicle with all-vegan interiors, reducing carbon emissions by 85%. Autoneum recently launched a 100% recyclable carpet from recycled PET.

Cars will talk and act as our support & safety system

Imagine if vehicles could talk, share data, and warn drivers of potential blind spots or disabled vehicles or whether it's safe to enter an intersection.

Vehicle-to-X technology will make cars more connected, where X could be another vehicle, infrastructure, device, network, or even your electricity grid. HAAS Alert, a company that develops vehicle communication platforms, in January'24, showcased the world's first cross-brand car-to-car communication capabilities between Volkswagen and Stellantis vehicles. Many automobile OEMs are adding V2V tech to chat with each other, but they still need a common language to understand one another. Additionally, Electric car batteries could soon store extra energy when there's it's in surplus and then send it back to the grid to power homes during blackouts! This tech, called Vehicle to Grid (V2G), is still being tested but has much potential.

Lastly, Intelligent, sustainable cars are a close reality

Imagine your car as a super-powered learner driver, constantly taking in information and making decisions. Researchers are developing AI that uses cameras, radar, and special laser technology- LiDAR to see the road better than any human driver and make safe decisions in tough conditions like bad weather.

While many challenges remain, the transportation industry is focussing on clean energy and eco-friendly materials to fast track to a greener and safer ride. The future of transportation looks electric, sustainable, and connected!

. While Cruise is facing a temporary setback, they're still progressing. Other companies like Aurora are even looking at ways to put AI into different vehicles. The Aurora Driver is designed to enable any vehicle type, from passenger sedans to class-8 trucks, to move safely and autonomously.

Think you need a trust fund to study at an Ivy League university? Think again! If you look at this list of courses, you'll see that you can take them for free from the comfort of your own home.

Harvard University and prestigious universities such as MIT, Stanford, Oxford, and Cambridge regularly offer free online courses. There's a pretty decent variety. Topics range from starting your own technology business to the basics of AI.

We've put together some programs to help you get a free education at not-so-free universities.

entrepreneurship

There are many courses aimed at people who want to learn about business, management, and innovation.

For example, there is a program run by Harvard University that specializes in doing business in emerging economies.

MIT offers a six-step course on how to start a technology company, taught by experienced businessmen. For now, the course is archived, but future dates will be announced, so keep this in mind if this is of interest to you.

Another MIT offering currently accepting enrollments is this course on supply chain analysis. Ideal for business leaders who want to understand statistics and analysis.

This isn't strictly an entrepreneurship course, but it's certainly worth mentioning. A Harvard University course on how to negotiate salary is very doable and can prove to be extremely valuable. The best part? It only takes 15 minutes.

A.I.

Harvard University offers an introductory course on AI using Python. Previous Python experience is required to take this course. This is a self-paced, project-based course aimed at enabling learners to incorporate AI concepts such as machine learning and his LLM into his Python programs. Registration closes today (March 22nd), so be quick.

Through its Coursera platform, Stanford University offers machine learning courses for beginners that promise to develop skills in logical regression, artificial neural networks, decision trees, recommender systems, and more. The course itself is free, but there is a fee to earn the certification.

data science

Stanford University and MIT have great options for data science. MIT's Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data Science course launched two days ago and is still accepting registrations. All you need is some prior knowledge of Python.

Stanford University also has a Python data science course on statistical learning. If you're looking for another language, Stanford University offers a relational database program using SQL.

computer science

If you want a regular, no-frills computer science learning experience, Stanford University's Computer Science 101 is for you. It is aimed at an ""inexperienced audience"" who want to ""try out small phrases of code to understand what computers are all about.""

MIT's software construction course may be a bit old, having started in 2016, but it does give you access to a variety of learning materials for free.

Finally, Harvard University offers materials for its classic mobile app development program and introductory web programming course. Both are good options for people who like projects but don't want to spend a lot of money.

Some reports posit that nearly 80 per cent of India's population suffers from one form of nutritional deficiency or another. This means the nation accounts for 50 per cent of the two billion people in the world suffering from one form of micronutrient deficiency or the other.

For a nation to truly develop, issues of malnourishment need to be strictly dealt with in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2.2 which seeks to eliminate all forms of malnutrition by 2030. Children and women are the worst hit and even though the government has rolled out several problems to stem the tide of malnutrition, the problem persists. From the National Food Security Act (2013), to the National Health Mission, and the Mid-day Meal Scheme, there's still a whole lot more to be done.

With the rise of agtech and the increasing penetration of technologies in the world of farming, there are indications that agritech might bring about succour in India's struggle to address malnutrition in the country. Information dissemination and awareness about crop nutrition, suitability of the soil for particular crops, and role of change in the traditional crop cycles can help to better crop selection from required nutrition point of view of the nation.

Agtech and nutritional crisis

It is important to establish that malnutrition has two main factors to consider; food availability and accessibility, and food fortification. What these suggest is that malnourishment is a factor of either non-availability or inaccessibility, or the absence of nutrients in available food. Using the right technologies and applications, these issues can be addressed significantly.

First, technologies like precision agriculture can help boost productivity by ensuring that farming operations are done accurately and timely. Sowing, using crop protection and nutrition solutions and even harvesting -- when done on time and with right method -- can lead to increased yield and quality. This kind of farming is nutrient-sensitive which seeks to conserve soil fertility. Healthier soil often produces crops with higher nutritional value.

Furthermore, smart solutions that support precision farming help to digitise farm planning and customise the plan so that each plot is treated per its own requirement. Using Internet of Things (IoT) for data collection is also one way to give precise and accurate data and process such data for better farm planning and practices.

Another important technology that can address the nutritional crisis in India is genome technology, in the form of genetic modification. Genetically modified seeds are fortified with the right components and characteristics, which often make them high yielding, pest resistant, and drought-resistant as well, depending on the genic or transgenic composition. This is a form of biofortification which enhances the natural composition of a seed and makes it more nutritious.

Building a healthy society with agtech

There are many other ways that technology can be integrated in agriculture to enhance nutrition, including the use of digital tagging and tracing to know the type and quality of seeds and crops in an area. The Union government can target areas with greater nutritional crisis and track the outcomes based on this tracing technology. This will help to prioritise and focus actions on specific targets.

Moreover, applying tools like drones, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) can bolster efficiency, which will reduce errors and increase productivity on farms. With greater investment in agricultural technologies, India can better surmount its nutritional challenges and support the health and welfare of its people.

Although all above things need to accessible to the farmers in all corners of the country, which will require tremendous collective efforts. At the present times all the above things are far from the common farmers. May be working on bringing them within the reach of the farmer is the most important point on which everyone needs to focus. It is worth appreciation that how government is working on the taking the drone technology to the masses in all the states with various schemes like Drone Didi etc. Again, it is a long way to go to make this technology available to the masses.

A country like India needs a technological intervention that can help the farmers to bring a revolution at large. at a low cost.

Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets. Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst. Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket. Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat. Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal. Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature. Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment. ""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI. While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents. Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat. The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time. ""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said. Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket. ""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said. Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent. However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory. ""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI. On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla. Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably. Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats. ""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said. Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal. ""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra. Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019. ""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said. In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding US$3.5 trillion (RM16.6 trillion) to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum, calling for steps to improve the sustainability of the property sector, reduce debt risks and focus more on domestic consumption.

Decisive steps to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and giving more space for market-based corrections in the property sector could accelerate a solution to current property sector problems and boost consumer and investor confidence, she said.

Premier Li Qiang said in his latest official remarks on the housing sector on Friday that China would further optimise property policy. Earlier this month, Li announced an annual growth goal of around 5% this year, a target some analysts said was ambitious.

China also needs to rely more on domestic consumption, Georgieva said. It can do so by raising incomes, boosting families' spending power and expanding the social security system, including the pension system, in a ""fiscally responsible way"".

China should establish a robust AI regulatory framework, Georgieva said, noting that China leads emerging economies in terms of AI preparedness.

China's industry ministry in January issued draft guidelines for standardising the AI industry, with the aim to have national and industry-wide standards in place by 2026.

China has ""enormous potential in advancing the green economy,"" Georgieva said. While China leads in deployment of renewable energy it needs to sell a greater share of electricity at market prices, to decarbonise more efficiently, she said. She also recommended China expand its emissions trading system (ETS) to the industrial sector.

The ETS, which currently covers the power sector, is expected to include new sectors like cement and aluminium by the end of 2025.",theedgemalaysia.com,news,The Edge Malaysia,,0.4745098039215687,448951179,1,https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Kristalina Georgieva imf 20230331_20230331180741_reuters_0.jpg,

In this interview with ANIEFIOK UDONQUAK to mark this year's International Women Day which is on 'inspiring inclusion', she spoke on a number of issues. She said that technology could be used to reverse the persistent high maternal mortality numbers; emphasised the importance of including proactive measures in safe motherhood conversation, among others. Excerpts:

How does proactive care help in effective healthcare delivery?

If you're complaining that women don't show up in hospitals for antenatal care till it is too late, the solution is not to sit down and wait for them to come. You have to be proactive by finding out the root causes, why the women are not coming for antenatal services in health facilities. What are the factors that are keeping them away from coming? Is it infrastructure? Is it culture? Is it religion? Is it a lack of funds? Is it the lack of quality care in the hospital? These are the non-tangible things you can do that will yield tangible results.

When did you realise the importance of proactive care in healthcare?

I have been a big proponent of proactive health care for as long as I can remember. When I started practicing, doing the rotation from department to department, I was given the responsibility of overseeing, alongside other doctors, operations in the newborn unit. That was the first time I had the opportunity to implement proactive care. This is because I noticed that we had children from well-to-do families and babies from families that were not so well-to-do. Now a lot of the issues that these children faced, they required prompt medication intervention.. A minute delay was too costly, so I told them that no child was going to die under my care. I saw that for some children, their parents could provide more than enough medication , meanwhile the child in the course of treatment did not need that much, and there were other children that did not need any at all. I sat down with the nurses and told them what we were going to do. We were going to gather all the medication, both the ones that were bought in the exact amount and the ones that were bought in excess and make sure it covered everybody. Since these children had unique sizes - meaning that one child could use less of the medications while others could use more, instead of wasting them,we gather everything in the bank and serve the children, and then make a list of those that did not buy and put pressure on them to get their prescribed medication. So we created that system, every medication went round, no child was left unattended to but the mothers did not know. Some of them would actually bring, others would not bring. However, those that brought were always more than those who did not bring. Until I left, we did not have a single case of fatality. That was the first time I combined the theory and the practical aspect of saving lives through proactive health care, because every child got the medication they were supposed to get. So, I'll say that proactive care is cheaper, faster, easier, time saving and produces results.

If proactive care is so important and critical, why is it not being implemented?

This is what BirthSafe is all about. BirthSafe will disrupt the way antenatal and maternal care is accessed. We are democratising access to antenatal care. I have been on both sides of the divide. I have been the doctor with 70 patients' to attend to and I could barely tell a patient 'good morning' because I was pressed for time. These patients need to understand why they are asked to do certan things. 'What is the implication for me and my baby? How often should I do it?'

They need more explanations than they are getting in the hospital, and I'm not talking about Nigeria only, I'm talking about Nigeria and the diaspora because we are serving thousands of women across 16 countries and the complaint is the same: ""I am not getting enough information."" You know that Nigeria is not the only country where doctors are in short supply. Doctors are in short supply in so many countries and the available ones are overworked and underpaid. There is no time for most doctors to catch a patient and sit her down, give her an hour and say, ""You will do this and so on."" It is ne impossible.

How does obstetric care come into the picture?

Obstetric care is unique. A woman is expected to see a doctor when she is pregnant and a hospital would accept her for antenatal care. If the hospital is benevolent, antenatal care could start from 13 weeks. If not, It may start from 14,15,or 16 weeks, During this time frame, a lot of things could have already gone wrong. For instance, black women are about 40 percent more prone to miscarriage than white women because of their genetic makeup. They have unique problems like fibroids,sigh blood pressure in pregnancy etc. These are the things that can take out pregnancy from the first trimester but you are not seeing that woman in her first trimester, you are telling her to come when she is sixteen weeks gone. So, if she loses her pregnancy and you tell her ""Oh madam sorry, try again"" without investigating and finding out why she lost the pregnancy so that the cause can be attended to next time, she still has no clue as to what to do right.

She gets pregnant again and is fortunate that the pregnancy stays beyond 13 weeks and she comes to your hospital. You give her an appointment and you see her once every month till she gets to 28 weeks. You see her from 28 weeks every two weeks. Then you start seeing her from 36 weeks once every week. In all this time, she hasn't gathered enough information. If anything goes wrong, no matter how good the hospital or doctor, she is the primary custodian of that child. The doctor cannot follow her home ( but now, BirthSafe can follow her to her home to monitor things.)

Due to the hyperdynamic nature of pregnancy and how the things you would least likely suspect can take out a pregnancy, these women have to be monitored more regularly. If you are talking about environments where emergency services are available, then these cases can be better managed. However in our society, just imagine the situation in Lagos, and you are calling for emergency care , that is an ambulance to get to you and there is a traffic gridlock, paint that scenario for me, how will it work? Or you are in a community that is three hours aways from a health facility.

Proactive care is the answer if we are going to beat this maternal mortality problem that we have. Since the cost of getting infrastructure is high due to other competing sectors like agriculture, education and many more, BirthSafe is already plugging in these gaps. What are the things that can cause a woman to lose her life in pregnancy and childbirth? What does she need to know? What does she need to do? How does she need to do it? When does she need to do it? BirthSafe is giving the type of antenatal care, training and preparation that even hospitals in the Diaspora are not giving because their patients are coming to us.

So how does Birth Safe work in reality?

It is a digital platform. For instance, If you want to travel by air and you can book your ticket online, you go to the airport, show your ticket and then you fly. That is the same way Birth Safe works, our women get the antenatal preparations and training, then they go to their hospitals with the right knowledge. The hospitals are so amazed that they are asking them; ""How do you know these things?'' They are looking at the papers and documents given to them at the hospital and they are no longer blank documents. These documents are now speaking to them because they know what to look for in their in their Blood Pressure, if their cervix is so-so number at this stage of their pregnancy, if their pregnancy is in danger. A woman with this knowledge has saved that pregnancy because of what she now knows, and the doctor would then agree with her on how best to manage the situation. It is a symbiotic relationship helping the hospitals to help the women better. We are helping our women get more value from the hospitals and we are saving the lives of both women and children.

Your services obviously seem to target the super rich families that can afford digital services.

No, that is why our mobile application platform is launching because this has been a concern to us. People who are economically challenged also need to have safe motherhood. They need to have safe pregnancy and childbirth too. Our app is bringing the cost of super antenatal care down. For less than the price of five cups of garri a month, a woman can access the antenatal training and guidance that she needs to take care of her for that particular month. I think it is very fair.

How are the women going to be aware of the services?

We have media partners. We also have to partner with governments across multiple levels and other media agencies to get the word out that women can do better in pregnancy, that they don't need to operate blindly. As a pregnant woman, there are things you can know and things you can do to safeguard that pregnancy, and this does not need to interrupt your life. You know that women are very robust in terms of economic activities, they move from place to place. So while she is moving from place to place, all she needs is to have access to a smartphone and data- that's all. Antenatal guidance on tap.

Also, it doesn't matter if she doesn't have a smartphone, she just needs to have an account with BirthSafe and she can access her account through a third-party smart device.

How serious is the issue of maternal mortality in Nigeria?

Nigeria is the fourth largest contributor to the maternal mortality numbers worldwide. Every two minutes, a woman dies because she tried to give birth. This is not a woman problem but a humanity problem. If we are talking about maintaining equilibrium in society, then we have to look at the family unit. What is the traditional family unit? It involves the man, wife and children. The woman is the primary caregiver, traditionally- in terms of nutrition, healthy living and moral education. If you take her out in the family, things will start to go wrong. If we are serious about achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), we have to start with maternal care. You want to get immunisation scaled up? Let the mother live. You want to stop under five malnutrition? Let the mother live. How about out-of-school children? Let the mother live. Teenage pregnancy? Let the mother live. BirthSafe is here to let the mother live.",businessday.ng,news,Businessday NG,Aniefiok Udonquak,0.3803921568627451,448951158,1,https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-36-1.png,

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla.

Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

The government has allowed Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to export crude oil it has stored in underground strategic storages at Mangalore to give operational flexibility to the foreign firm, an order of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said on Saturday. At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85% of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.",dtnext.in,news,dtNext.in,Reuters,0.08235294117647052,448950841,1,https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/03/24/811376-untitled1.jpg,

He underscored the importance of seizing this opportunity to forge a brighter future, noting that such a chance may only arise once in a lifetime.

""There may not be a third or fourth chance, so seize this opportunity to increase income and ensure you do not fall back into the financially vulnerable category,"" he told Bernama during a recent interview.

The Second Chance Policy is a government initiative designed to protect the welfare of individuals burdened by small-scale debts, that provides a pathway out of bankruptcy under specific criteria, effective from March 1, 2023.

During the tabling of Budget 2024 last year, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim unveiled the extension of the Second Chance Policy to encompass individuals under 40 years old with debts not surpassing RM200,000, effective this year.

Anwar noted that nearly 14,000 bankruptcy cases involving minor debts under RM50,000 had been discharged as of July 2023.

Mohamad Fazli, who is also the Dean of the Human Ecology Faculty at Universiti Putra Malaysia, underscored the initiative's capacity to mitigate the emotional burden and societal stigma attached to financial hardships culminating in bankruptcy filings.

He highlighted that many young bankrupt individuals often overspend in pursuit of extravagant lifestyles, and thus suggested that the government should monitor discharged individuals to prevent them from sliding back into debt.

Several TMC leaders aspiring for tickets have openly voiced their unhappiness over not being nominated for the seats they eyed. The BJP has witnessed similar dissatisfaction among some influential leaders over candidate selection.

At least five senior TMC leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor and party spokesperson Santanu Sen, who were seeking nomination from Malda North and Dum Dum seats respectively, have expressed dissatisfaction after being denied tickets.

Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's younger brother, Babun Banerjee, voiced his displeasure after not being nominated for the Howrah seat, in which the TMC gave its ticket to sitting MP Prasun Banerjee. The CM disowned her brother following his outburst.

Sitting BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, who had previously switched over to the TMC two years ago, returned to the saffron party after being denied a ticket.

Similarly, TMC's four-term MLA and ticket aspirant from Kolkata North, Tapas Roy, joined the BJP due to disagreements over the re-nomination of five-term party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay from the seat.

Likewise, the BJP, which has announced candidates for 19 of the 42 seats so far, has also encountered embarrassing situations as Union minister and Alipurduars MP John Barla and Rajya Sabha MP Ananta Maharaj, who have significant influence over Scheduled Tribes and Rajbanshi community respectively, expressed dissatisfaction over the selection of candidates in some seats in north Bengal.

Barla was replaced with the party's assembly chief whip Manoj Tigga for Alipurduars, while the BJP re-nominated Union minister Nisith Pramanik in Cooch Behar, even as Maharaj, a prominent figure in the Greater Cooch Behar statehood movement, opposed his candidature.

Both the TMC and BJP, amidst their intense election campaigns, downplayed the discontentment.

""What you are calling discontentment is actually disappointment, which is natural if you are expecting something and don't get it. But except for Arjun Singh, everybody else is still in TMC and is working for the party,"" TMC spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told PTI.

While 16 of the 23 sitting MPs were retained, the TMC chose not to re-nominate seven incumbents.

Two-term MP from Bardhaman Purba, Sunil Mondal, who had joined the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls only to return after the saffron camp's defeat, was also dropped, and a political newcomer was nominated for the seat.

The TMC candidate list included 26 fresh faces, 11 of whom were political greenhorns. Not a single candidate who lost in the 18 seats in the 2019 polls was offered candidacy this time.

""Would we nominate Arjun Singh and Sunil Mondal so that they again betray us after winning on our tickets? It was a conscious decision by the party not to make them candidates,"" Ray said.

Mausam Benazir Noor, the scion of Congress stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury's family and the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP, expressed her displeasure over being overlooked for a party ticket.

""I wanted to contest from the Malda North seat as I had won it twice but got defeated last time due to division of votes. Anyways, the party must have taken such a decision considering various factors,"" Noor, who had switched over from the Congress in 2019, said.

Former cricketer Yusuf Pathan's nomination from the Congress stronghold of Behrampore seat initially sparked an inner-party debate, with TMC's Bharatpur MLA Humayun Kabir criticising the nomination of an ""outsider"" and contemplating contesting as an independent.

However, after the intervention of the TMC's top brass, Kabir changed his stance and decided to work for the party nominee's victory.

""There is nothing wrong in being an aspirant for a ticket, and expressing disappointment if overlooked is normal. But once the party announces the nominees, every one of us has to work to ensure the victory of the party candidates,"" Santanu Sen told PTI.

On the other hand, the BJP, which has set a target of winning over 35 seats in the state, has also been trying to pacify Maharaj and Barla.

Maharaj, who heads one of the factions of the Greater Cooch Behar People's Association (GCPA), holds sway over the Rajbanshi community, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate in the region. The BJP had offered him nomination during the Rajya Sabha polls last year, and he won comfortably.

Similarly, Barla, who had attracted attention in 2021 after demanding a Union territory for north Bengal, is a popular leader of the STs and tea garden workers in Alipurduars. In 2019, Barla played a pivotal role in securing BJP victory in both Alipurduars and adjoining Jalpaiguri seats.

""The party has already spoken to them, and the issues will be sorted out. It is quite natural to express displeasure if your expectations are not fulfilled. The party stands united,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Political analysts believe that while dissent among lesser-known figures is unlikely to significantly affect the TMC's poll prospects, given the party's reliance on the CM's popularity, it could pose a concern for the BJP due to caste dynamics, particularly in north Bengal.

""For the TMC, Banerjee holds sway, making the dissatisfaction of these individuals inconsequential as they lack significant political weight,"" said political scientist Subhamoy Maitra.

Political analyst Maidul Islam, on the other hand, highlighted the pivotal role caste equations played in favour of the BJP in 2019.

""The discontent might upset BJP's prospects in not only Cooch Behar and Alipurduar but also Darjeeling and some other seats of north Bengal, which the saffron party had swept in the last Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In 2019, the TMC had won 22 seats whereas the BJP had bagged 18 seats, out of which seven were from north Bengal.

Many nations have capitalized on their land and property assets to drive economic growth and diversify their income streams

The Real estate business has proven to be a lucrative revenue-generating opportunity for countries worldwide. Many nations have capitalized on their land and property assets to drive economic growth and diversify their income streams. For example, in 2019, the real estate sector contributed $3.5 trillion to the United States GDP, accounting for 17.5 per cent of its total economic output. Similarly, the United Kingdom's property market generated £68.1 billion in revenue in 2018, showcasing the sector's significant financial impact.

Nigeria's real estate sector has enormous potential, given rising urbanization, uncensored population growth, and housing needs. However, it remains bogged down by challenges like unclear or impaired land titles, exorbitant costs of available real property, bureaucracy, unnecessary and avoidable infrastructure deficits, and lack of transparency and inefficiency, not only in government, but also with those involved in transactions. The market needs extensive reforms across policy, legal, regulatory, and financing frameworks to foster greater structure, standardization, development impact, and financial returns.

Dubai provides a highly relevant blueprint. Within two decades, it transformed itself into a leading global real estate destination by strategically deploying location advantages, business-friendly policies, top-notch infrastructure purposely deployed to encourage and enable investors, and relentless government support and promotion of the real estate market. This article explores the legal framework and strategies that have contributed to Dubai's success and how Nigeria can adapt these lessons to unlock its own real estate potential.

Key Features Of Dubai's Exceptional Real Estate Legal System

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), particularly Dubai, has developed a remarkable real estate legal system that has contributed to its success as a global real estate investment destination. The emirate's real estate laws and regulations are designed to attract foreign investment, protect investors' rights, and ensure transparency in the market. Here are some key aspects of the emirate's real estate legal system that make it outstanding:

Freehold ownership for foreigners: In 2002, Dubai introduced a law allowing foreign ownership of property in designated areas, making it one of the first Gulf countries to do so. This has attracted significant foreign investment in the real estate sector.

Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA): Established in 2007, RERA is responsible for regulating and overseeing the real estate sector in Dubai. It aims to protect the rights of all parties involved in real estate transactions and promote transparency in the market.

Escrow accounts: Dubai's real estate laws mandate the use of escrow accounts for off-plan property sales. This ensures that developers cannot misuse investors' funds and that the money is only released when construction milestones are met.

Strata law: Dubai's Strata Title Law, introduced in 2007, provides a clear legal framework for the ownership and management of common areas in multi-unit developments, such as apartments and condominiums.

Real estate registry: The Dubai Land Department maintains a comprehensive real estate registry that records all property transactions, ensuring clarity of ownership and reducing the risk of fraud.

Dispute resolution: The Dubai Land Department has a dedicated Rental Disputes Centre, which provides a streamlined process for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Courts and the Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) offer specialized dispute resolution services for real estate cases.

Investment protection: The UAE has signed bilateral investment treaties with numerous countries, providing additional protection for foreign investors in the real estate sector.Tax advantages: The UAE does not impose income, capital gains, or property taxes on individuals, making it an attractive destination for real estate investment.

Long-term visas: In 2019, the UAE introduced long-term visas (up to 10 years) for investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals, which are tied to property ownership. This has further incentivized real estate investment in the country.

Challenges: The Dubai real estate polices has been successfully implemented because the government and people of the country have collaborated to enable effectiveness leading to the tremendous progress and profit. The challenges with reforms working in Nigeria are numerous because of a lack of practical adherence to the rule of law. We are hopeful that government will implement favorable policies that uplift the sector, and also hopeful that corruption will not erode the gains derived from such policies.

Recommendations for Nigeria: Nigeria can replicate components of the Dubai framework to reform and unlock the immense potential of its realty ecosystem. Features of the Dubai model that can be adopted include:

Institutional Reforms

Establish a federal real estate regulator: Create an independent overseer (like RERA in Dubai) that will work with states to establish and enforce standards, provide title guarantees, resolve disputes, coordinate state agencies, and streamline the convoluted approval processes.

Boost buyer trust and developer compliance.

Set up Infrastructure Development Fund: Lack of power/energy, access roads, drainage, and water infrastructure increases costs and delays projects. Set up an integrated fund with public seed financing and private partnerships to fund infrastructure development on a user-fee/demand basis, or give economic or material incentives to private developers who can, and have the capacity to build these infrastructures.

Incentivize Free Trade & Business Zones: Provide tax holidays, single-window clearance, and customs duty relaxation for developers to establish Dubai-like self-contained townships integrated with offices, malls, and homes. Attract FDI into these zones to enable world-class development and catalyze wider market maturity.

Legal/Regulatory Overhaul

Real Estate Regulatory Bill: Draft comprehensive legislation covering consumer rights, standard project approval protocols, model buyer-seller agreements, dispute resolution mechanisms, and real estate transaction procedures to start with.

Title Regularisation and Digitisation: Simplify and formally recognize existing land title mechanisms via a National Titling Bill. Set timelines for land agencies to fully digitize and integrate title records across states for transparency and efficiency.

Financial Reforms

Promote Public-Private Partnerships: Mobilize pension funds, insurance companies, and foreign investment into real estate by amending guidelines to increase asset allocation. Develop fail-safe risk mitigation tools.

Housing Development Fund: Set up an integrated mortgage liquidity facility to offer attractive long-term home finance rates and incentives. Provide specific incentives for developing low-cost housing projects across urban and semi-urban centers through private and public partnerships.

Conclusion

Actualizing the above policy and regulatory changes can significantly elevate standards, increase participation, and encourage financial flows into Nigeria's realty space over the next 3-5 years. The Dubai example reinforces the fact that visionary leadership and business-conducive governance can profoundly boost the market. The fundamentals necessary to replicate such a success story locally, are strongly positive and possible in our environment.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding $3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum, calling for steps to improve the sustainability of the property sector, reduce debt risks and focus more on domestic consumption.

Decisive steps to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and giving more space for market-based corrections in the property sector could accelerate a solution to current property sector problems and boost consumer and investor confidence, she said.

Premier Li Qiang said in his latest official remarks on the housing sector on Friday that China would further optimise property policy. Earlier this month, Li announced an annual growth goal of around 5% this year, a target some analysts said was ambitious.

China also needs to rely more on domestic consumption, Georgieva said. It can do so by raising incomes, boosting families' spending power and expanding the social security system, including the pension system, in a ""fiscally responsible way"".

China should establish a robust AI regulatory framework, Georgieva said, noting that China leads emerging economies in terms of AI preparedness.

China's industry ministry in January issued draft guidelines for standardising the AI industry, with the aim to have national and industry-wide standards in place by 2026.

China has ""enormous potential in advancing the green economy,"" Georgieva said. While China leads in deployment of renewable energy it needs to sell a greater share of electricity at market prices, to decarbonise more efficiently, she said. She also recommended China expand its emissions trading system (ETS) to the industrial sector.

The ETS, which currently covers the power sector, is expected to include new sectors like cement and aluminium by the end of 2025.

He hypothesized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession combined, creating cyclical variations in the intra-annual and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation on the Earth's surface. This cycle has greatly influenced climate, resulting in major climatic patterns.

The Axil Precession goes back to the ancients' observations. The Maya discovered this movement because when they built a temple, they aligned with the stars only to discover that the stars had moved. The Earth's axis of rotation, known as the Precession of the Equinox, was calculated to have a period of about 25,700 years. I believe the accuracy of the Economic Confidence Model frequency 8.6 is a source derived from this movement of the Earth itself. The calculations I ran further refined that approximation of 25,700 years to 25,800 years of 3 x 8.6.

I believe that the 100,000-cycle may actually be 95,852 years in length. Milankovitch believed that the angle of the Earth's axial tilt had the greatest effect on climate and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes. Therefore, he concluded that there was a 41,000-year period of ice ages. However, in Science back in 1976, Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton published ""Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages. For 500,000 years, major climatic changes have followed variations in obliquity and precession. Their work asserted that 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years were involved, which have impacted the ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last million years. This most likely might be refined at 43,000 (8.6 /2). Their work confirmed the hypothesis proposed decades earlier by astronomer Milutin Milankovitch.

Some have been arguing that since this Milankovitch Cycle predicts that we should be getting colder, while it has been getting warmer since 1970 when the scientists were predicting an ice age was coming, this is all because of CO2 and Methane gas. They blame farming that cuts down trees, adding CO2 to the atmosphere, and in Asia, rice farming produces methane. Throw in cars, and we are doomed thanks to the Industrial Revolution, where we should somehow return to the Stone Age. This is why there are some cheering nuclear war in hopes of reducing the population by 50%.

They REFUSE to look at the sun's beating between solar maximum and minimum. They only want to take the data that supports their predetermined conclusion -- kill 50% of the population to save the planet. The peak in the solar cycle tends to correlate with the major turning points in the war cycle. Extending the 11-year solar cycle back in time even brings us to the fall of Rome.

There is a correlation between solar activity and volcanoes. VEI is a logaritmic scale, so to create the same impact of one VEI 7, you need 10 VEI 6, 100 VEI 5, 10,000 VEI 4 or 100,000 VEI3. Volcanoes not only throw up dust that deflects the sun's energy, which Bill Gates wanted to shoot up particles to permanently block the sun, but the higher the explosion also shoots ash much higher into the atmosphere, and a VEI 5+ may reach the stratosphere. Consequently, the impact of a VEI 5 would occur every 12 years and a VEI 9 only once every 27,000 years. This is what causes the big mass extinctions that appear to be cycles of multiples of 31.4 million years following Pi.

Evidence suggests that volcanic winters occur during the Solar Minimum and have caused events like the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), which was a VEI7. This eruption was probably the largest since the 6th century AD, producing devastation between 535 and 536 AD. It is believed that the year without a summer was probably enhanced due to the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines, which was VEI4. Even just taking the 1814 and 536 events, dividing that by 8.6 and dividing that results again by 8.6 brings us to 17.2, which is twice the 8.6 frequency.

Even looking at historical records, we find that major volcanic eruptions have brought down empires. It is assumed that Thera (Santorini) erupted between 1600 and 1700 BC, which destroyed the Minoan Empire. Then, the Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD was probably the most famous of all eruptions.

Emperor Titus rushed to open the Coliseum after Pompeii's destruction. We can date his coin to 80AD since he was granted the Vonsulship VIII for that year. This was one way of trying to change the mood, much like rushing to open the Empire State Building during the Great Depression, to demonstrate that things would be getting better.

Additionally, Titus devoted much of his silver coinage of Atonement to the gods for the disaster of Pompeii. There were four main Atonement issues commemorating the services of prayer and propitiation through which the emperor attempted to address the public alarm over the disaster. People often attributed such events to the gods being angry. The coinage showed emblems seeking the approval of Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, and the deceased former Emperors to watch over the Roman people.

The Huns began a migration Eastward because of droughts, but by 430-450AD, Asia had a severe drought. especially under King Attila, made frequent and devastating raids into the Eastern Roman Empire. There appear to have been droughts in Asia, which inspired them to move East. Asia has been prone to megadroughts that have lasted more than 1000 years. Central Asia today is cyclically moving back toward a drought. The year 2021 was a major drought in the region, and this has historically caused migrations. In fact, it has been called the worst drought on record.

In 451, they invaded the Western Roman province of Gaul, where they fought a combined army of Romans and Visigoths at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields in 452 AD. What the mass migration brought was Malaria, which devastated Europe in 450AD. Nobody formally knows where the Huns came from. It is believed that they may have been the cause of the building of the Great Wall of China. The Huns came into Europe's history when, in 370AD, they crossed the Volga River and conquered the Alans. Two years later, they attacked the Ostrogoths, an eastern tribe of Germanic Goths.

By 376, the Huns had attacked the Visigoths, who then sought sanctuary within the Roman Empire. As the Huns conquered the Goths and Visigoths, they became barbarians uninterested in culture. By 395 AD, they began invading the Roman Empire and were at the gates of Rome by 410 AD. They did not appear to have issued coinage until they invaded Europe.

However, evidence has been uncovered worldwide that the early Dark Ages of the 6th century AD was most likely triggered by the eruption around 535/536 AD, which was probably a VEI7+ event. The Roman historian Procopius (c. 500 - 565AD) recorded in 536AD in his account of the wars with the Vandals, ""During this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness... and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear."" Numerous accounts from Ireland to China describe this major event.

This cataclysmic phenomenon occurred at the peak of the Economic Confidence Model Wave #762 (532-540AD), which was 536.55 (July 19/20). It has long been believed that the eruption was from Ilopango in El Salvador. There was probably a second eruption, perhaps in Indonesia, and it may have been Krakatoa. This volcanic explosion altered the world and even changed religion. Justinian I's (527 -565AD) nearly lost his throne during the January 13, 532AD Nika riots, and another conspiracy against the emperor's life by dissatisfied entrepreneurs was discovered as late as 562AD. Justinian was struck by the plague in the early 540s thanks to the eruption of 536AD and the malnutrition spread of the plague. However, he recovered, but his wife Theodora died in 548AD. This event created such major political unrest, economic decline, and social changes that few people have ever bothered to connect the dots.

There was a major volcanic explosion that was equal to more than 2000 Hiroshima-sized bombs. Human civilization was altered from the Mayan to Mongolia in the north to Constantinople and Southeast Asia. What unfolded were plagues, famine, death, and great migration, which caused people to move south. Empires and city-states collapsed, including Teotihuacan in Mexico and the Anglo-Saxon victory over the Celts and invasions, contributing to Islam's rise. Even in India, the Gupta Empire (319-550AD) of Northern India collapsed by 543AD as the Huns overran it during the mid-6th century.

The devastation to agriculture lowered the economic growth, and by 602AD, the army in Byzantium revolted, overthrowing the government and installing Phocas, who became a spokesman for dissatisfied soldiers. When the army revolted in 602AD, the revolt successfully captured Constantinople on November 23rd, 602. Phocas declared himself emperor on the same day. The Sasanian Empire (224-651 AD) in Persia peaked during the 6th century and ended by 651 AD. This was all set in motion by the volcanic winter. The political, economic, and religious changes that occurred because of this devastating 6th-century volcanic winter were profound. According to the traditional account, the Islamic prophet Muhammad began receiving what Muslims consider divine revelations in 610 AD.

The last solar wave, Solar Wave #24, reached Solar Maximum in April 2014. Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych fled Ukraine on February 22nd, 2014, going into solar maximum. We are in Solar Wave #25 and are approaching solar maximum, ideally by January 2025. This will probably also enhance rising civil unrest globally. We will then turn it down into Solar Minimum, which should peak between 2030-2032. Therefore, this rise in magnetic storms and gamma rays may cause major volcanic eruptions. This could easily result in a cold period that could be increased in amplitude by volcanic eruptions.

Taiwo, who stressed the need for surveyors to use modern technological surveying instruments, said that the introduction of technology would improve their service.

He said this in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State capital at the Annual Mandatory Continuous Professional Development Programme, organised by the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS), Ekiti State Branch.

Delivering a lecture themed: 'Leveraging UAVs For Effective Land Administration And Management,' Taiwo stated it was vital for surveyors to deploy unmanned Aerial Vehicle for efficient and effective land administration.

""In the ever-changing world, I believe the adoption of technology is important. It will bring about efficiency, effectiveness, and save time and cost. We will be able to do what we do faster so that we can meet the needs of the public faster.

""Government can actually do so much to make this work. We are trying our best at NIS. We have just been able to place a drone (cost station) to make our jobs more consistent.

""We are doing that at our end but we are thinking that if the government helps us with this technology, they can help us get a base map of the whole Ekiti State. It will be used for so many purposes to help us make sure that we can better maintain what we are doing.

""It can help us and others to get results like land use, land cover, and several other things. We would like the government to recognise our efforts because if we are trying to make things easier for people at our own cost, it would be better too if the government is committed to what we are doing.

The Chairman, the Planning Committee of MCPD, Surveyor Emmanuel Adogboyega said that the programme was important for all surveyors for their development.

He said that continuous professional development has become mandatory for all surveyors to upgrade their skills and keep themselves updated with emerging trends.",thenationonlineng.net,news,"Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",Rasaq Ibrahim,0.2941176470588236,448949550,1,,

BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - With a comprehensive package of pro-market reforms, China could grow considerably faster than a status quo scenario, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday.

""This additional growth would amount to a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years, in today's terms, that is like adding $3.5 trillion to the Chinese economy,"" Georgieva said in a speech to the China Development Forum, calling for steps to improve the sustainability of the property sector, reduce debt risks and focus more on domestic consumption.

Decisive steps to reduce the stock of unfinished housing and giving more space for market-based corrections in the property sector could accelerate a solution to current property sector problems and boost consumer and investor confidence, she said.

Premier Li Qiang said in his latest official remarks on the housing sector on Friday that China would further optimise property policy. Earlier this month, Li announced an annual growth goal of around 5% this year, a target some analysts said was ambitious.

China also needs to rely more on domestic consumption, Georgieva said. It can do so by raising incomes, boosting families' spending power and expanding the social security system, including the pension system, in a ""fiscally responsible way"".

China should establish a robust AI regulatory framework, Georgieva said, noting that China leads emerging economies in terms of AI preparedness.

China's industry ministry in January issued draft guidelines for standardising the AI industry, with the aim to have national and industry-wide standards in place by 2026.

China has ""enormous potential in advancing the green economy,"" Georgieva said. While China leads in deployment of renewable energy it needs to sell a greater share of electricity at market prices, to decarbonise more efficiently, she said. She also recommended China expand its emissions trading system (ETS) to the industrial sector.

The ETS, which currently covers the power sector, is expected to include new sectors like cement and aluminium by the end of 2025.

Nigerian art continues to gain global attention and command staggering fees on the domestic and international markets.

This development comes against the backdrop of an increasing representation of artists by professionally-run galleries specialising in art from the African continent; more appearances by Nigerian artists at major fairs, biennales and festivals, all over the world, more artists studying at prestigious international institutions; and critical text, well distributed to new audiences through alternative channels including social media.

On a daily basis, between 10.00am and 12.00pm, you're sure to find nothing less than 20 artists at the DHL office with well packaged art works ready to be couriered abroad. It is a testament to the growing interest that African artists have spurred on the international markets.

Amid strong demand and skyrocketing prices, contemporary African art is increasingly attracting the attention of investors worldwide. At least half of the contemporary African art sales registered at auctions worldwide are believed to come from buyers within the continent, chiefly Nigeria and South Africa.

Experts also cite the strong growth of African economies and the rising wealth of the middle class as leading factors in the surge of interest around contemporary African art.

Taking advantage of the evolving art market in Nigeria, Vetiva Fund Managers Limited (VFML) has partnered with a Lagos-based advisory firm, GoudenFara, an intersection of art and finance, for the release of its maiden Pre-Auction Advisory Note designed to provide key insights into the individual market fundamentals of artists whose works are scheduled for sale on the international auction market.

The partnership with Vetiva Fund Managers, a leading investment management firm in Nigeria and subsidiary of Vetiva Capital Management Limited (VCML), seeks to catalyse further growth and development within the art industry in Nigeria and the African continent, in alignment with Vetiva's vision of showcasing investment opportunities in the alternative assets space in Africa.

The landmark partnership will see both firms combine their expertise across the capital market and art economy. It will equally enable them to offer unique solutions to investors considering art in their alternative asset portfolio.

The chief executive officer (CEO) of GoudenFara, Ekiko Inyang, expressed optimism and confidence that the synergy of both firms would result in creating a solid entry point for financial market participation in the art market, thereby, ensuring adequate management of asset, financing structure, and holistic wealth reporting.

According to Inyang, the pioneering initiative has potential to bring the standard of equity market analysis into analysing art as an asset class, and also provides unparalleled market research and insight tailored for investors and collectors who are keen on integrating art into their alternative investment portfolio, as well as wealth managers who manage the account of clients looking to optimize their art holdings.

He said, ""the pre-auction advisory note is also useful to art industry stakeholders such as gallerists, dealers, auctioneers, artists and art advisers, giving them access to crucial information about underlying factors driving the market.""

For the Managing Director, VFML, Mrs Oyelade Eigbe, the initiative places the concerns of investors at the forefront because, ""I believe that art goes beyond canvas. Its role as a financial instrument in portfolios must be reimagined.""

She noted, ""in an era of evolving investment landscapes, where traditional asset classes face challenges, and investors seek diversification and stability, fine art is emerging as contemporary contender. And beyond aesthetics and cultural significance, art is increasingly recognised as a viable financial assets and this partnership with a significant focus on research-backed analysis aims to shed light on why art deserves a place on balance sheets alongside stocks, bonds, and real estate.""

The VFML boss revealed that ""fine art offers stability and resilience, holding value overtime with low volatility in terms of crisis, adding ""it offers diversification potential as it has minimal correlation to traditional assets. And with fine art being a specialised area, Vetiva and GoudenFara's teams look forward to providing expert guidance and research-driven insight in the journey of extending art's value beyond galleries and museums.""

On the Pre-Auction Advisory Note, she said, ""this comprehensive advisory note meticulously researched by GoudenFara's team of analysts aims to uncover how the art market works and serves as a valuable resource for navigating its intricate paths.

""In recognition of the growing interest in art as a financial asset, and component in alternative investments, GoudenFara's analysis equips investors with strategic information to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of art and finance. So, this début edition of the advisory note provides market coverage for renowned Nigerian modernist artist Ben Enwonwu, whose 1982 oil example portrait of Tonkin Jackson is scheduled to go under the hammer in Modern and Contemporary African Art collecting category at Bonham on March 27 in its London Afternoon sale,"" Eigbe said.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.411764705882353,448949335,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Enwonwu-640x360.jpg,eng-9421510

Erin, who left work to teach and look after her three children, and James, a sales director who was based in London but has been able to predominantly work from home since Covid, could be forgiven for feeling rather smug now, because they have not only saved a lot of money but settled on a thriving rural town just named the best place to live in Wales.

Speaking to the young couple from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire, which won the acclaim in the Sunday Times best places to live guide and is famed for its food - the town's world-renowned food festival has been going for 26 years - and scenery, it feels silly to ask why they moved here. Erin, perched on the end of her sofa in her leafy home, points behind her to the imposing Blorenge mountain, one of Abergavenny's three peaks, which is almost entirely visible from the double doors in her bright kitchen. ""When you can take the kids out to play in the snow on that it's a no-brainer,"" she smiles.

Their children are nine, seven and five and are all flexi-schooled - attending a nearby private school two days a week with the money saved from their move. For the other three days Erin takes them out exploring. James travels to London for meetings once or twice a fortnight. Lessons learned from lockdown have changed their lives beyond measure.

""The children love being outdoors in the mountains and that was the big thing,"" Erin explains of the pull of the area which also boasts two other impressive mountains - the Skirrid and the Sugar Loaf. ""They love the water here. We go down to the stream and you can see straight to the bottom. In the summer we take the inflatables and have a great time down there.""

The couple are one of hundreds of families who have poured into the area in recent years, including Connie and David Orbach who run Shepherds Ice Cream Parlour in the town using milk from their farm. They are among an abundance of independent gems in the town. ""It's really convenient having everything within walking distance and it's so easy to get to Cardiff and Bristol,"" Connie says. ""It's an amazing environment. I love being able to walk straight out of my house and onto the Sugar Loaf. But I also love the fact that this is a place where it's easy to meet people and make connections. There are a lot of nice people here who are up for doing things.""

Taking your children out of school and moving to a different country seems a huge step. Erin responds: ""Yeah, but my eldest hadn't been coping well with school for some time. We'd already decided we were taking them out of school. They were in school until Covid and my eldest daughter wasn't enjoying it at all. She was fine with it academically but it was the whole structure of school. When Covid happened it was like we got our little girl back. We decided we just couldn't put her back in that situation and she's been developing brilliantly ever since.""

Brychan Todd, of local estate agents Christie's Residential, says the town has seen an influx in young families since the pandemic - although the average age according to the latest census was still one of the highest in Wales at 49. ""I think in many ways Abergavenny presents a better balance for some and that balance is appealing to more and more people now,"" Brychan explains of why so many people want to move here despite a relatively high average house price of £318,000.

""When you come to Abergavenny and you drive down the A44 suddenly everything opens up and you can see those three peaks, it's fantastic. It's a beautiful part of the world and it's a rural town but it's also incredibly well-connected with the M4 and the train station. That means people can work a couple of days a week in the office in London or Bristol or wherever and it appeals to commuters and young professionals in a way neighbouring towns like Monmouth probably don't. The home working age has been huge for Abergavenny."" As well as a train station the town has its own hospital and a comprehensive school that is getting ready to expand into a 3-19 all-through school for September.

Erin and her children have not long returned from a day out at the old station at Tintern beside the Wales-England border a 45-minute drive away, where the children have learned about evacuees in the Second World War as part of a local flexi and homeschooling group Erin recently joined and which is growing. In Wales more than 5,300 children are now not being taught in school - the highest number on record. Support award-winning journalism with WalesOnline's Premium app on Apple or Android

""Every day is different,"" Erin adds. ""Everyone is nicer here - that is actually a thing. People are more chilled and it's much more child-friendly than where we've been before. We go to the market and the kids are curious and asking questions and running around and no-one is fazed by it. We've got an allotment too which we're teaching them how to clear and grow on.""

In the nearby village of Llanvapley where you could hear a pin drop and which looks idyllic on a warm spring day 99-year-old Doris Evans knows all about evacuees. She was one when she and her sister escaped to the country in the early 40s. ""I've gone through it all,"" Doris, the oldest person in the village who puts her longevity down to an afternoon nap and a glass of red a day, tells Leah Tod, landlady at the recently reopened Red Hart Llanvapley pub which had been closed since 2004 and had 200 people attend its reopening night. ""There are still worries all over the world, and we're lucky that here we have peace and quiet and we can carry on and get on with our lives the best we can. People in Abergavenny are very friendly people. My daughter goes into town and she always says how friendly they are in the shops.""

Looking out onto her two acres at the back of the pub which dates back to the 19th century and where her ponies graze, Leah explains how she ended up here. ""I wanted a quiet spot where we could enjoy the scenery and have space for the horses and our Jack Russells, and I wanted to turn it back into a pub. Within 10 days of moving in we'd managed to get a special licence and transformed what was the lounge into a bar area. We were open very quickly for the Christmas period, although we were a bit nervous no-one would turn up. It turned out 200 people crammed in here. Doris came to our opening night and was one of our special guests. She's known the pub all her life. We didn't know anyone in the village, so it was emotional to see that many people turned out for us and we've had tremendous support ever since.""

""The town works brilliantly because it isn't a picture-perfect chocolate box like other market towns in the UK,"" Brychan explains. ""It's got a very healthy mix of housing stock. If you look in the immediate town centre near to Bailey Park you've got semi-detached houses built in the post-war period that are very well built. You have ex-local authority housing here too that is very well-regarded and forms a large portion of homes. I've just sold a house to a family who have moved here from Bridgend for £190,000. You've got quainter and smaller period stock in and around the town centre too. In the west there are some grander properties that are pre-war. It has allowed for a small but varied population with different interests and that makes for a thriving town centre.""

In the heart of the town is the popular and diverse market that first opened here in the 13th century. It's open four days most weeks and has a flea market on a Wednesday and a night market - well-liked by younger folk - on the last Thursday of the month. Greengrocers June and Steve Phillips have been lugging their Danish trolleys to Market Hall at the crack of dawn here for more than 40 years. It takes them a couple of hours to set up at their station before customers come pouring in. For the latest Welsh news delivered to your inbox sign up to our newsletter

Once full of spuds and carrots, their trolleys are now packed with far more eclectic produce from chard and kale to grow-your-own plants partly-grown in Steve's polytunnel and on his one-and-a-half acres in nearby Pandy. They sell like hot cakes at their colourful stall which is complemented by a variety of alternating traders. June says they're now in demand more than ever partly thanks to an obsession with superfoods which has caught them by surprise.

""A few years ago we'd have said we don't really get a younger demographic, but that's now completely changed,"" she explains. ""Particularly on a Saturday, probably 30% of our customers are the younger generation. They aren't coming to us because they always have, they're coming because they're more aware of where their food comes from now and they want quality, nutritious choices, and many of them want to grow their own food. More people than ever are wanting to grow their own stuff and the plant side of it has grown significantly. We do a lot of chard, kale, spinach - there's a huge appetite for it. They are all things I don't ever remember people really wanting, but now they've got into it a lot. People are really into their wellbeing and nutrition and it's reflected all across Abergavenny.""

The thriving market is accompanied by a high street packed with coffee shops and eateries. It isn't full of chain retailers, it's a town which has adapted effectively to what its locals and visitors want. ""It's café culture done right,"" June says. ""People come here to enjoy eating out and getting together. Coming to Abergavenny is an experience.""

Husband and wife Jon Mahoney and Suan Lian Goh aren't frustrated by the competition - they are grateful for it. ""It keeps you on your toes,"" Jon says from the couple's Little Singapore in Abergavenny truck situated in the far corner of the market which is nicely busy even on a Tuesday morning. ""It keeps you on your toes. We keep each other's quality high and we help each other wherever we can. That's what makes Abergavenny what it is. People come here from across the UK because it's the best place to come for food and drink.""

The couple quit their old careers as a plumber and an acupuncturist to sell meals inspired by Suan Lian's homeland of Singapore. Their leap of faith has paid off and then some. ""Suan Lian had a practice in Cardiff that did herbal medicine and acupuncture and I went there for treatment. Then we ended up getting married,"" Jon recalls with a laugh while preparing for the pending rush at lunchtime. They've already been here since 6am and it'll be gone 5pm by the time the shutters are down.

""She's always liked cooking and she had grown bored. We'd moved away from Cardiff and she was no longer practicing acupuncture. We first started cooking meals and selling them to neighbours at the start of lockdown and it's grown from there. People then started asking us what was in the meals and so we started selling the products Suan Lian uses to make them. At our age it was a bit of a risk, but we're used to taking risks and it's gone really well. It's a new chapter in our lives we're enjoying very much because the market is brilliant, as is Abergavenny. It's a very diverse market with lots of different traders that change most days. There's live music and DJing usually on the last Thursday of the month which attracts a younger crowd and that's helped us a lot. We're fortunate here because Abergavenny does have a younger crowd too, and we rely on younger people because they're more inclined to try our food. They're also very interested in buying out-of-the-ordinary things from the shelf.""

Rock and horror fanatic Cindy Dowell is carefully lining up her skulls at her creepy homewares and trinkets stall she's cleverly named Witchful Thinking Emporium. One of the market's newest traders, she's been here for 14 months and says selling products alongside the market's stalwarts, some of whom she's known since she was young, is a ""dream come true"". ""As a child I'd always come to Abergavenny with my parents,"" she recalls. ""I then brought my children here on the weekends for a day out. It's always been a beautiful place to visit and there's always been a lot to do, but it's the people that make it. That's what drew me back here. I left my job at Hallmark Cards because I wanted to meet people here that were like minded.""

Emma Lewis moved her vinyls here from Monmouth to save on her overheads. A year on she says it's the best decision she's ever made. ""I was selling them in a shop in Church Street in Monmouth but I decided to leave because it was becoming difficult. I'm pleased I did it. In the last year Abergavenny has been even better. This is the best market in Wales to me and is the best town in Wales. I've got limited overheads, I'm selling the records - especially on Wednesdays during the flea market when it's predominantly antiques and vintage. The summers are especially good because it's the sort of thing tourists are more likely to buy, and we get a lot of tourists here.""

The town might also win recognition for most nosey neighbours, because it boasts what is surely one of the busiest Facebook community groups in the UK. Abergavenny Voice has almost three times as many members as the town's 13,500-strong population. It was created by Craig Titchener and his friend in 2014, ironically in the hope it would prove the locals' keenness for a McDonald's, which was eventually approved.

""In 2016 the Abergavenny branch opened its doors and as our group had grown to more than 2,000 members it seemed a shame to close it just because it had succeeded in what it set out to achieve,"" Craig says. ""Over the years through the growth of the group I've met some amazing people which I think if it wasn't for Abergavenny Voice our paths wouldn't have crossed. From local tradesmen and business owners to volunteers, councillors and even the mayor, I've met amazing people who have restored my faith in human kindness.

""I have learned so much about Abergavenny from the group, which led me to becoming part of Abergavenny Lido Group (a community group which has long campaigned for the reopening of an open-air lido in Bailey Park), as well as delving into the rumoured maze of tunnels under Abergavenny. Over the years I've been asked to share plenty of good news as well as sad news. On those occasions the community has come together sharing congratulations and condolences. They are the times when I'm reminded how important the group is.""

Julian Edwards, known locally as the spud detective because his baked potato stall doubles up as Abergavenny's informal lost property point, encapsulates the town's community spirit. ""The other day someone handed in a wallet and it had two-and-a-half grand in it,"" he laughs. With the help of his own strong following on social media he has raised £30,000-worth of medical aid for Ukrainians following Russia's invasion in 2022, as well as for Turks following the Turkey-Syria earthquake last year.

Previously owned by Pete the Spud for more than 30 years, the business has always been known as Tasty Tatoes and has used the same supplier - a local farmer - for 43 years. ""I wanted an easier life to be honest,"" Julian explains of why he threw the towel in on his old career predominantly in logistics which took him around the world. ""I hit a wall where I realised I wanted something less stressful and I haven't looked back.""

He's cooking chilli, curry and stirring baked beans at 8am, before he wheels his decades-old Pickwick oven into position in Cibi Walk for 10.30am. ""It's a Rolls Royce,"" he says of the oven. ""Never not been able to start that in five years. You get a lot of spud traders trying all sorts now, but generally people just love the traditional cheese and beans.""

By 12pm there's usually a long queue. ""You get people travelling from all over - west Wales, the Midlands, I even had a couple from Australia who had Abergavenny on their bucket list. That's what it's all about. Thousands of people walk past me every day and I try and say 'hello' and 'how are you?' to every one of them. You'd be surprised how many stop for a chat and share their happiness or their problems. I'll have a chat with people and try and point them in the right direction. That's what we do here. Even a cwtch goes a long way. There is an older demographic here than other places and with that you see more people going through tough times - whether it be a bereavement or health problems. Sometimes you don't need to be a doctor to help someone.""

""It is hard work,"" he reflects on the long six days a week. ""It sounds like a lot but it's the happiest I've been. When you're out on your pitch it's like a live performance and every day, once you get into the swing of it, it's very enjoyable because of the people you meet.""",walesonline.co.uk,news,WalesOnline,Jonathon Hill,0.2862745098039217,448949327,1,https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article28857123.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_rbp_mai190324abergavenny26828JPG.jpg,

The plan was developed alongside the Department of Conservation, Environment Canterbury and Ngāti Wheke to protect Hector's dolphins, which are known to breed around Lyttelton at this time of year.

Hector's dolphins are native to New Zealand and are classed as nationally vulnerable, with about 15,000 in existence.

Coutts, the chief executive of SailGP, said other harbour users were not subject to such ""restrictive"" protocols.

Nor did other countries require SailGP to agree to such measures before allowing racing there.

He said there were marine mammals in the water in all of the locations where SailGP raced worldwide.

""We've never had an incident in 35 years.""

He said there needed to be a balance in the decision-making.

""For example, one could say that because there is a chance of a road death that we shouldn't be allowed to drive on the roads. I suspect most people would conclude that such a stance would be far too extreme and not practical.

""Inherently, as a society we accept an element of risk in our daily lives.""

International teams spent considerable amounts of money on sending their teams to New Zealand to compete, Coutts said.

The fans - it was estimated about 11,000 were in Lyttelton on Saturday - were also left disappointed.

""There are a lot of considerations in managing an event like this yet almost none of those are not being properly considered by the environmental and harbour authorities here in Christchurch.""

Two of her colleagues from Otago University were on an expert panel discussing the issue ahead of last year's race.

""They already said, 'look, if you absolutely must do it in Lyttelton Harbour then you should do it in the middle of winter'.""

Slooten said she was pleased to hear Coutts wanted to move the event to Wellington or Queenstown next year.

It was a poor decision from Christchurch officials to host the races, she said.

""This just seems to be a really bad bet, especially because these dolphins are actually very important economically to the Canterbury region.

""There's a lot of dolphin tourism on Akaroa Harbour. Really you don't want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.""

F1 race stream, start time, grid and latest updates today","The 2024 Formula One season heads to Melbourne today as Max Verstappen looks to make it a hat-trick of wins to get his latest title defence off to a perfect start. The Red Bull driver is on pole position in Melbourne but does not have his teammate Sergio Perez for company at the top of the grid.

Having qualified third, the Mexican serves a three-place grid penalty which means Lando Norris joins Carlos Sainz inside the top three for lights out. There will also be a different feel about today's F1 race as only 19 cars will take to the start, after Alex Albon was handed Logan Sargeant's car after putting his Williams in the wall during practice.

It is also proving a difficult weekend for Lewis Hamilton, who put his Mercedes just 11th on the Albert Park grid. It is an early start for fans in the UK with the race getting underway at 4am GMT. You can follow all the action from the Australian Grand Prix LIVE via Standard Sport's race blog!

We're set for a two-stopper today with graining looking like a big issue.

It could be mediums to start before a couple of runs on the hard starting as early as lap 10.

We are set for 58 laps around the Melbourne street circuit, which comes in at 5.278km.

It's a familiar sight on the F1 calendar but two raised kerbs have been removed since last year's race, at turns 4 and 10, along with the addition of a concrete run-off strip behind the turn 11 kerb.

Four DRS areas come into play down the start-finish straight and then after turns 2, 8 and 10.

Sergio Perez set the in-race lap record last year, with a 1:20.235 as Max Verstappen claimed his first win here on a one-stopper.

We are just 30 minutes away from lights out at sunny Albert Park.

It's that time of the grand prix when the garages swing open for the drivers to head out on track for the first time, before forming up on the grid.

Many inside the paddock see Max Verstappen as crucial to brokering peace inside the Red Bull team.

And he put his flag in the ground amid rumours over his future during the week.

Lewis Hamilton admitted he is at a loss to explain why his Mercedes car is performing at wildly different levels over the course of the same day, let alone the season.

The seven-time world champion starts 11th on the grid despite looking secure for a crack at Q3 in practice.

""The inconsistency in the car really messes with the mind,"" he said.

""There is a long list of things to fix. Our car is on a knife-edge. In the afternoon the wind picks up and the car becomes unstable, but the others can pick their pace up in qualifying and I am not sure why. It didn't feel the same in qualifying from practice even though we had lighter fuel.

""It is not a great feeling for everyone in the team but we will keep working away.""

Not often that the words 'Nikita Mazepin' get an airing in F1 circles these days but the Russian had his name taken off an EU sanctions list during the week.

Carlos Sainz starts second on the grid today having been ruled out of the Saudi GP a fortnight ago with appendicitis.

He said after qualifying: ""I think if you would have told me two weeks ago when I got the appendix removed that I would be in Australia ready to go again and fighting for pole position, I would have 100% taken it.""

What's extra impressive is the Spaniard admitted upon arrival that he was still feeling a bit under the weather - and hadn't been able to do any simulator work to prepare.

Alex Albon's crash in Friday practice led to his Williams car being deemed beyond repair, with no spare chassis for the British team Down Under.

Given he is their No1 driver, Williams took the tough decision to hand over Logan Sargeants' car to Albon - a move the American described as his toughest day of his career.

Albon said: ""He's been an absolute gentleman in the whole situation, and he's a real team player. So on my side, it was just trying to do the job at hand because, at the end, you can't really think about it too much.

""You know, you go and do your job and then that's the best payback I could give to the team, and to him, was to try and do a good job today and tomorrow.

""So, obviously the atmosphere and the environment that we're in is not pleasant. We don't want it to happen again.""

There have been some quality moments in the Australian Grand Prix over the years... here are some of the best.

Sergio Perez was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Nico Hulkenberg during qualifying.

The Q1 incident forced the Haas to take evasive action at turn 13 of his hot lap, with the Mexican on the racing line during an out lap - he drops from third to sixth as a result.

""He was having a Mexican siesta, I think,"" Hulkenberg remarked afterwards.

""He wasn't looking in the mirror, the closing speed coming around Turn 12 is so quick now. If you're not paying attention enough it happens very easily and quickly. But of course it shouldn't happen.""

Lando Norris has hopped into P3 and admitted before the verdict that he was already chuffed with fourth on the grid.

""It's probably better than I was expecting,"" he said. ""Honestly. [I thought] two Ferraris, two Red Bulls, I didn't expect to be ahead of one of them. It was Charles, so probably even more of a surprise.

""But yeah, happy with today, honestly. I've not [felt] like I've done that well this weekend. I struggled to put things together and just to get comfortable with the car, knowing how to push on it. Normally when I feel like I push, it goes the opposite way of what I want.

""It's something I'm still struggling with, I would say, and I've struggled with a bit this season.""

Business is booming in F1, but scandals threaten to burst the bubble

01:30

Formula One revealed on Friday morning that 124,113 people had come through the turnstiles simply to watch two practice sessions for the Australian Grand Prix -- a record attendance.

Partly, it is the lure of the Australian contingent on the grid: Oscar Piastri and Daniel Ricciardo, not to mention adopted Aussie Valtteri Bottas, whose mullet-wearing, ute-driving antics have been causing a ripple this week.

But also it is the ongoing Drive to Survive effect and the monumental rise in the sport's popularity both on track and for those watching from the sofa back at home.

Those numbers are all the more remarkable in that this season has the makings of being another monumentally one-sided affair.

F1 has become obsessed with cracking the United States and, it has to be said, with three grands prix there, it has done so successfully. And it begs the question whether the sport's hierarchy has taken its eye off the ball in this constant drive, with it now seemingly skipping from one scandal to another?

Last year's race was one hell of a stop-start affair - with four red flags!

No rain is forecast for this race in the Aussie autumn. Temperatures should sit at a comfortable 21ºC with light winds and some cloud cover.

TV channel: In the UK, coverage of grand prix Sunday begins from 3am GMT on Sky Sports F1 and Sky Sports Main Event.

Free highlights of the race will air on Channel 4 at 12.30pm.

Live stream: Sky Sports subscribers will also be able to watch events unfold live online via the Sky Go app.

The third round of the F1 season takes us to Melbourne's Albert Park and it's, as ever, an early (or late, depending on your approach) one for fans in the UK.

We are set to get underway at 4am GMT with Max Verstappen on pole position.

DOGE could decrease to $0.08 over the next term. FIL is poised to continue its downward trend.

Many experienced traders have taken note of Rebel Satoshi's $RECQ as one of the most rewarding investment opportunities in 2024. On the other hand, experts warn that Dogecoin (DOGE) and Filecoin (FIL) could experience massive price corrections. Let's delve into detail and try to detect the top crypto to invest in today.

Rebel Satoshi is a revolutionary meme coin project that provides outstanding benefits for its growing community of users. Hence, token holders play an active role in Rebel Satoshi's governance and receive valuable rewards for participating in the platform's vibrant two token ecosystem.

According to a recent DOGE price prediction, Dogecoin investors should brace for substantial corrections in the forthcoming DOGE price movements. More precisely, Dogecoin bears believe that DOGE is set to drop toward $0.08 by the end of the year.

DOGE traded around the $0.14 threshold during the third week of March, which means that Dogecoin could decrease by 42.85%. Analysts point to DOGE's rapidly increasing volatility and the token's increased selling pressure as some of the main reasons for this pessimistic prediction.

Conversely, Dogecoin supporters praise DOGE as a good crypto to buy based on its excellent ranking by market capitalization and Dogecoin's solid use case. In addition, Elon Musk stated during a Q&A session on March 13 that Dogecoin holders could soon utilize DOGE to purchase Tesla vehicles. Thus, some experts believe that Dogecoin could manage to surpass the $0.25 level by the year's close.

Filecoin's continued drops from the $10 threshold have resulted in negative predictions about FIL's upcoming performance. According to Filecoin bears, FIL is set to resume its negaive trend and dip beneath the $6 range by the end of 2024.

FIL traded at around $8.50 during the third week of March, meaning that Filecoin could decrease by more than 29.41%. This bearish FIL price forecast is based on multiple factors such as Filecoin's high inflation rate and experts' evaluation of FIL as a risky short-term investment.

On the other hand, some crypto analysts have suggested FIL as one of the best coins to invest in today based on its massive future potential and the positive sentiments over Filecoin in the wider community. Furthermore, the platform announced in an X post on March 18 that users have deployed over 3,000 unique contracts on the Filecoin Virtual Machine. Hence, Filecoin bulls claim that FIL is bound to exceed the $14 mark by the end of the year.",punchng.com,news,Punch Newspapers,,0.3568627450980393,448948463,1,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24044733/ada.jpg,eng-9415800

In a recent investigation into AI's role in regional development, CNA unveils groundbreaking projects leveraging machine learning to address age-old environmental issues. From revolutionizing weather forecasting to monitoring biodiversity and quantifying plastic pollution, these initiatives are poised to reshape sustainability efforts in the region.

In the dynamic realm of weather forecasting, precision and timeliness are paramount, especially in regions susceptible to climate extremes like the Philippines. Atmo AI, spearheaded by co-founder Mr Alex Levy, is on the cusp of transforming weather prediction by harnessing AI's capabilities. Through a partnership with PAGASA, the national meteorological agency, Atmo AI aims to provide more accurate and localized forecasts, crucial for a nation enduring a quarter of the world's typhoons annually. By shunning conventional methods and embracing machine learning, this collaboration promises to empower communities with enhanced preparedness and resilience against climate-related disasters.

With traditional forecasting methods failing to keep pace with evolving weather patterns, Atmo AI's disruptive approach heralds a new era in meteorological science. By dissecting vast urban landscapes into thousands of distinct zones, the platform offers unprecedented granularity, akin to donning glasses for a clearer vision. Ms Maria Cristina Uson of PAGASA emphasizes the potential of AI-driven forecasts in bolstering early warning systems, a vital component in safeguarding lives and mitigating property damage. As the Philippines embarks on this pioneering journey, neighboring nations express keen interest, hinting at a broader regional adoption of AI-based weather forecasting.

Venturing into the heart of Southeast Asia's lush rainforests, AI's transformative potential extends to biodiversity monitoring, a critical endeavor in conservation efforts. Clara Hernblom and Johan Närvä, students from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, embark on a quest to decode the region's diverse ecosystems, from pristine forests to degraded landscapes. Armed with AI-powered audio recorders and the Arbimon platform, the duo endeavors to decipher wildlife activity and assess restoration efforts in Sabah, Malaysia's Borneo island. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize data collection, enabling real-time analysis and insights crucial for informed conservation decisions.

Arbimon's evolution from a rudimentary audio storage tool to a sophisticated AI platform underscores its pivotal role in bridging the gap between science and conservation. Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection, underscores the platform's global impact, with millions of recordings analyzed across diverse ecosystems worldwide. Despite AI's immense potential in eco-acoustics, regulatory hurdles impede its widespread adoption in Southeast Asia. Mr Yassin advocates for decentralized data governance, essential for fostering international collaboration and maximizing AI's conservation benefits. As the region grapples with biodiversity loss, AI-driven solutions offer a ray of hope in safeguarding Southeast Asia's natural heritage.

Plastic pollution poses an existential threat to Southeast Asia's pristine coastlines, with the Philippines bearing the brunt as the world's leading plastic polluter. Driven by the urgency to quantify and mitigate this crisis, Dr Deo Florence Onda spearheads Plasticount Pilipinas, a groundbreaking initiative harnessing AI and drone technology. By employing machine learning algorithms to classify plastic waste, the project aims to establish a comprehensive baseline, essential for informed policy formulation and targeted interventions. From coastal cleanups to aerial surveys, AI emerges as a potent ally in combating plastic pollution across the archipelago.

The advent of AI heralds a paradigm shift in plastic waste management, transcending conventional methodologies plagued by inefficiency and subjectivity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, Plasticount Pilipinas empowers policymakers with actionable insights tailored to local contexts. As Southeast Asia grapples with the plastic menace, similar initiatives in Indonesia and Singapore underscore the region's collective resolve to address this transboundary issue. Dr Onda emphasizes the imperative of regional collaboration, stressing the interconnected nature of plastic pollution and the need for harmonized policymaking. In a world grappling with environmental degradation, AI emerges as a beacon of hope, offering innovative solutions to safeguard Southeast Asia's natural ecosystems.

As AI continues to revolutionize environmental conservation efforts across Southeast Asia, one question lingers: How can regional collaboration and data sharing be enhanced to maximize AI's impact on sustainability initiatives? By fostering an ecosystem of innovation and cooperation, Southeast Asia can harness AI's transformative potential to address the region's most pressing environmental challenges comprehensively.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.03529411764705892,448947942,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

Before 2007, the Ibadan media space, particularly the radio arm, was dominated by the government-owned stations such as Oluyole and Premier FM. Oluyole FM was known as Radio O.Y.O. 2 until 2009, when the name was changed by the former governor, the late Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala. The station hit the airwaves in 1972 as a companion to an AM service.

Though the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) had been in existence in Ibadan, Premier 93.5 FM was commissioned by the late First Lady of Nigeria, Chief Stella Obasanjo, on October 30, 2001. It was berthed as a result of the Olusegun Obasanjo-led Federal Government's objective of setting up 32 FM stations across the country.

All along, only government stations had been sources of listening to radio. However, the city's media firmament changed in 2007, when the Chief Adebayo Akande-owned radio outfit, Splash 105.5 FM, began broadcasting.

Shortly after Splash 105.5FM began to enjoy the monopoly of being the premier private radio station, Space 90.1 FM joined the league. It is the first tri-lingual radio station in Nigeria owned by Otunba Deji Osibogun, an Ijebu chief.

Since then, many radio stations have joined the Ibadan market. As at the last count, there are about 50 stations in the city operating at different levels - commercial, community and business.

The stations include, Lead City University Campus Radio 89.1 FM, Star 91.5 FM, Impact Business Radio (IBR 92.5 FM), Royal Root 92.9 FM, Raypower 95.1 FM, Agidigbo 88.7 FM, Thirty-Two FM 94.9, Lagelu 96.3 FM, Jamz 100.1 FM, Oluyole 98.4 FM, Amuludun 99.1 FM, Diamond 101.1 FM, and Splash 105.5 FM.

They also include, Petals 102.3 FM, Fresh 105.9 FM, Lead Radio 106.3, Noble 107.1 FM, Pensioners 106.7 FM, Blast 98.3 FM, Life 107.5 FM, Solutions 93.9 FM, Crest 91.1 FM, Omoluabi 87.7 FM, Prince 89.7 FM, Honor 103. 5 FM and Success 105.3FM.

Others are Vintage 93.7 FM, Soul 95.7 FM, Correct 99.5 FM, YES 101.7 FM, Medal 99.9FM, IITA Radio 88.5FM, Wells 89.3 FM, Ilaji 91.9 FM, Almond 94.3 FM, Iri 96.1 FM, Pep 100.3FM, Melody 100.7 FM, JND101.5 FM, Reiz 101.9 FM, Tiwantiwa Radio 106.5 FM, Adamimogo 105.1 FM, I-flier 103.3 FM, and so on.

What are the attractions in Ibadan, leading to the influx of radio stations?

Scholars, veterans, practitioners and investors in the media landscape attribute the development to the huge population, proximity to Lagos, historical importance of Ibadan and a host of other reasons.

The scholars and stakeholders include a former General Manager of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) Ibadan and former Chairman of Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC), Dr. Yemi Farounbi.

The former ambassador said: ""First is the population of Ibadan. Second is that Ibadan used to be the intellectual and arts capital of Nigeria. Third, many who have the clout to access the licences are Ibadan-based. NBC does not appear to have any plan or designed template for allocation of licences, beyond availability of frequencies.""

Similarly, a former acting Rector and former Dean of School of Communication and Business Studies of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Femi Ipadeola, said Ibadan enjoys a vantage position after Lagos for many reasons such as the ease of obtaining licences for the Oyo State capital.

The former anchor with Channels Television and pioneer Head of Impact Africa Television (IATV), said: ""As a professional, trainer, scholar and investor in the media, I am aware that in the Southern part of Nigeria, after Lagos, Ibadan is the next populated city. It has a huge population. It is ten times easier to apply for licences outside Lagos. Outside Lagos, you will still want to be close to Lagos, which will be Ogun and Oyo states.

""Also, there is a concentration of higher institutions in Ibadan. In my opinion, I may be wrong though, Ibadan has the largest concentration of research institutions and centres in the country. I can't think of any location in Nigeria that has the highest number of universities, research institutes, polytechnics, colleges of education and other monotechnics.

""Added to that is budding professionals, even though most of them have their head offices in Abuja and Lagos, almost all major professional bodies have their base in Ibadan. Ibadan boasts of professionals in large quantities even more than Port Harcourt. Again, the historical recognition of Ibadan as a culture centre. In the 50s, 60s, up to 70s, Ibadan was Nigeria's cultural centre. Ibadan was the industrial hub of Nigeria, though it was overtaken by other parts of the country.""

To Dr. Bayo Busari, Senior Lecturer, Department of Mass Communication and Media Technology, Lead City University, Ibadan and a public affairs analyst, ""The attraction to Ibadan is due to the saturation of the Lagos/Ogun axis and probably due to the low tax regime as well as other financial burdens on the operational costs of existing radio stations.""

Toeing the same line, the Acting Head of Department of Mass Communication, Precious Cornerstone University (PCU), Ibadan, Oluwole Ayinla, said:"" Ibadan is the largest city in Nigeria. It hosts headquarters of some religious institutions. It has about five private universities with other public institutions. Ibadan has a conducive environment for business. Cost of living is not as high as that of Lagos and Abuja. Also, Ibadan has numerous fee- paying private schools. All these attract these radio stations to Ibadan.""

Also speaking, a media entrepreneur and Special Assistant to Governor Seyi Makinde on Communications, Dayo Ogunbowale, said Oyo State offers a huge audience with a massive population of urban settlers, adding, ""Providing quality content should naturally attract the right attention, inclusive of steady revenue.""

Adding his voice to the issue, a practising journalist, Akin Aboluwade, said Ibadan as the political headquarters of the Southwest with business relevance and close proximity to Lagos, Nigeria's commercial nerve-centre, has what it takes to attract the media and any other venture for that matter.

Of a truth, the establishment of any business entity is an inflow and injection into the economy with its multiplier impacts such as employment generation, knowledge transfer, improved manpower in form of human capital development, more revenue to government and returns to the owners.

However, many questions are cropping up - are the 50 radio stations actually adding value in terms of human capital development? Is the quality of broadcast topnotch? Are they viable and sustainable? Can the Ibadan economy support the stations and make them afloat?

The questions become apt in the face of recent happenings in the industry as some of them are finding it difficult to weather the economic storm,leading to operations shut-down. By the time of writing this report, some stations are off air. Those in this category are Space 90.1 FM, Beat 97.9 FM, Naija 102.7 FM, Kings 103.9 FM, and Inspiration 100.5 FM.

Speaking on the development, an avid radio listener, Dr Oladotun Oluwasanya, said the influx is meant to be a blessing but the proliferation seems to be outpacing the economy of the state which is turning out to be a strain on the sustainability of some of the media houses and the economy of the state at large.

On the viability of the stations, Oluwasanya said: ""I see a station like Fresh FM as highly sustainable owing to its rich package going by the line-up of its weekly programmes and the calibre of presenters / OAPs. Same can also apply to Splash.

""However, stations like Pensioners FM, Raypower do not really have the content and package but the source of funding for the stations will somewhat keep them running for a long time. Beat FM and Raypower have strong bases in Lagos from where resources can flow to sustain the stations.""

Lamenting that the proliferation is not good for the industry, Femi Ipadeola, said it is watering down standards and reduces the value attached to radio and professionals in the industry.

Ipadeola said: ""They can't even sustain 25 per cent of those stations. It is evident. The proliferation began about 12 years ago. It started slowly in 2007 and by 2015, it got to a high level. If you look at those radio stations that came then, how many of them are still operating and operational?""

Nonetheless, the communication lecturer brought another perspective to it, saying with his observation through interactions with some media owners, many of them were established for other purposes.

""Maybe philanthropy, ego, political clout, some may just want to make a statement.

Sometimes, some business people may put money into particular ventures not because they don't know it will not yield profits but they understand that business can lead them to other things that can give them money"", Ipadeola explained.

In his analysis, Farounbi said that, ordinarily, an increase in the number of radio stations should be a matter of great joy, stressing, ""the increase should provide diversity and plurality of options and choices. Unfortunately this is not so as most of the stations sound alike with no unique and distinctive content. The stations have become monotonous repetition or copy of the few outstanding stations. I believe this is because the NBC has not perhaps considered the content as an important pillar in the survival of the stations. So, we have many stations, but sounding alike and offering listeners no diversity.

""Also, the population of Ibadan can sustain the number of stations. But certainly the economy of Ibadan cannot sustain the number of stations that are dependent on advertising revenue. The industries are not there. Many of them like glass, Exide battery, Atlantic carpet and so on, have folded up. The few businesses like breweries, soft drinks, and banks are headquartered in Lagos. Their location in Ibadan doesn't give any advantage to Ibadan-based radio stations, since the advertising of the products are nationally designed.""

Ogunbowale, Governor Makinde's aide, said: ""All these said and done, it will be foolhardy for anyone to assume that the business environment in Lagos is comparable with that of Ibadan. Not true. ""I believe a good portion of the about 50 radio stations will struggle to pay salaries in the next six months.""

The acting HOD of PCU, Oluwole Ayinla also said the economy of Ibadan cannot support this influx because there are few industries in Ibadan.

However, Dr. Busari said the economy of Oyo State may not be so relevant to support the presence of the radio stations due to the fact that the stations do not necessarily have to rely directly on the state's economy.

""The operational market for the radio stations is more global since advertisers abound beyond the state,"" he added. Speaking on how the media houses can remain afloat, Farounbi called on the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to begin to lay greater emphasis on economical viability as an important criterion in granting of licences, while Ipadeola called for collaboration and sharing of infrastructure such as buildings, and energy, in order to reduce operational cost and overhead. Ogunbowale, on his part, called for quality broadcasting.

On the whole, the influx of the media houses to the political capital of Yorubaland is advantageous as it provides ample opportunities and jobs for young broadcasters and increases government revenue. Against this backdrop, it is expedient for the managers and owners of the outfits to embrace creativity, adaptability, ingenuity and sustainability principles to remain afloat.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.003921568627450966,448947741,10,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ibadan-1-640x360.jpg,

The event, in Lyttelton Harbour, was set to get under way at 3pm on Saturday but was delayed after a dolphin was spotted in the racing zone.

After it had not moved on after two hours, the day's racing was abandoned entirely.

Under SailGP's marine mammal management plan, racing must stop if a dolphin is sighted and not continue until 20 minutes after it is last seen.

The plan was developed alongside the Department of Conservation, Environment Canterbury and Ngāti Wheke to protect Hector's dolphins, which are known to breed around Lyttelton at this time of year.

Hector's dolphins are native to New Zealand and are classed as nationally vulnerable, with about 15,000 in existence.

Coutts, the chief executive of SailGP, said other harbour users were not subject to such ""restrictive"" protocols.

Nor did other countries require SailGP to agree to such measures before allowing racing there.

Saturday's incident was ""another example of New Zealand being handcuffed by unprecedented layers of bureaucracy and red tape"".

He said there were marine mammals in the water in all of the locations where SailGP raced worldwide.

""We've never had an incident in 35 years.""

He said there needed to be a balance in the decision-making.

""For example, one could say that because there is a chance of a road death that we shouldn't be allowed to drive on the roads. I suspect most people would conclude that such a stance would be far too extreme and not practical.

""Inherently, as a society we accept an element of risk in our daily lives.""

International teams spent considerable amounts of money on sending their teams to New Zealand to compete, Coutts said.

The fans - it was estimated about 11,000 were in Lyttelton on Saturday - were also left disappointed.

""There are a lot of considerations in managing an event like this yet almost none of those are not being properly considered by the environmental and harbour authorities here in Christchurch.""

Otago University zoology professor emeritus Liz Slooten earlier said it was normal for Hector's dolphins to be around the harbour at this time of year and having a race delayed was ""totally predictable"".

Two of her colleagues from Otago University were on an expert panel discussing the issue ahead of last year's race.

""They already said, 'look, if you absolutely must do it in Lyttelton Harbour then you should do it in the middle of winter'.""

Slooten said she was pleased to hear Coutts wanted to move the event to Wellington or Queenstown next year.

It was a poor decision from Christchurch officials to host the races, she said.

""This just seems to be a really bad bet, especially because these dolphins are actually very important economically to the Canterbury region.

Companies are seeking to make their products more robust to survive the rigours of shipping, with some saying they have already seen results, in the form of fewer returns.

ITC, for instance, changed the cap of shower gels to prevent leakage even when there is no scotch tape. This is one among changes in the packaging design for most of its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Parle Products is adding protective layers for its '30-80 biscuit packs, which mostly sell online. It has also introduced a separate outer packing for bundled biscuit packs to be sold online, to ensure they are not broken.

Goods sold online change hands more times than offline, often being roughly handled by delivery personnel, company executives said, adding that the chances of leaks or transit damage increase while shipping individual units.

ITC personal care products business chief executive Sameer Satpathy said ecommerce-friendly packaging provides a relative advantage since consumers want full value from their purchases. A damaged or leaked product fosters discontent.

Parle vice-president Mayank Shah pointed to the increasing sales via quick commerce of FMCG. Most FMCG companies have been reporting an improvement in ecommerce's share of total sales since the pandemic.

This is led by a change in shopping behaviour and the rise of quick commerce in large cities.

Researcher NielsenIQ shows online contribution for impulse food such as chocolates, confectioneries and salty snacks rose to 5% in 2023, from 3% in 2022. In case of products such as washing powders/liquids, pre-post wash products, detergents and bleaches, online contribution climbed from 6% to 7% year-on-year. r. For utensil, toilet, floor and glass cleaning fluids, online sales grew from 10% of total sales to 11% in the period under review.

Little wonder then that an FMCG major even discussed packaging in a recent management committee meeting after a few executives complained of receiving damaged products when purchased online. Dabur, targeting younger consumers buying online, has started to redesign packs for online sales. Chief executive Mohit Malhotra said it is launching ""aspirational packaging"" that is more consumer-friendly ergonomically -- making it easier to hold and use.

Health food brand Bagrry's has shifted mid-sized packages for cereals from cardboard boxes to pouches and jars, while adding corrugated boxes for its plant-based beverages to reduce transit damage. The company has also designed a 1.5-kg corrugated box pack of muesli in collaboration with Amazon, so the latter does not require to add a protective layer of additional packaging. ""The returns due to shipping damage have drastically come down due to these packaging changes,"" said Bagrry's India director Aditya Bagri.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.09019607843137245,448947734,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108738591,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-74700,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg",

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.

In a bid to combat pressing environmental challenges, Southeast Asia is witnessing the emergence of environmental AI solutions, showcasing the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a recent investigation into AI's role in regional development, CNA unveils groundbreaking projects leveraging machine learning to address age-old environmental issues. From revolutionizing weather forecasting to monitoring biodiversity and quantifying plastic pollution, these initiatives are poised to reshape sustainability efforts in the region.

Revolutionizing weather forecasting with AI

In the dynamic realm of weather forecasting, precision and timeliness are paramount, especially in regions susceptible to climate extremes like the Philippines. Atmo AI, spearheaded by co-founder Mr Alex Levy, is on the cusp of transforming weather prediction by harnessing AI's capabilities. Through a partnership with PAGASA, the national meteorological agency, Atmo AI aims to provide more accurate and localized forecasts, crucial for a nation enduring a quarter of the world's typhoons annually. By shunning conventional methods and embracing machine learning, this collaboration promises to empower communities with enhanced preparedness and resilience against climate-related disasters.

With traditional forecasting methods failing to keep pace with evolving weather patterns, Atmo AI's disruptive approach heralds a new era in meteorological science. By dissecting vast urban landscapes into thousands of distinct zones, the platform offers unprecedented granularity, akin to donning glasses for a clearer vision. Ms Maria Cristina Uson of PAGASA emphasizes the potential of AI-driven forecasts in bolstering early warning systems, a vital component in safeguarding lives and mitigating property damage. As the Philippines embarks on this pioneering journey, neighboring nations express keen interest, hinting at a broader regional adoption of AI-based weather forecasting.

Environmental AI solutions - Amplifying conservation efforts

Venturing into the heart of Southeast Asia's lush rainforests, AI's transformative potential extends to biodiversity monitoring, a critical endeavor in conservation efforts. Clara Hernblom and Johan Närvä, students from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, embark on a quest to decode the region's diverse ecosystems, from pristine forests to degraded landscapes. Armed with AI-powered audio recorders and the Arbimon platform, the duo endeavors to decipher wildlife activity and assess restoration efforts in Sabah, Malaysia's Borneo island. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize data collection, enabling real-time analysis and insights crucial for informed conservation decisions.

Arbimon's evolution from a rudimentary audio storage tool to a sophisticated AI platform underscores its pivotal role in bridging the gap between science and conservation. Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection, underscores the platform's global impact, with millions of recordings analyzed across diverse ecosystems worldwide. Despite AI's immense potential in eco-acoustics, regulatory hurdles impede its widespread adoption in Southeast Asia. Mr Yassin advocates for decentralized data governance, essential for fostering international collaboration and maximizing AI's conservation benefits. As the region grapples with biodiversity loss, AI-driven solutions offer a ray of hope in safeguarding Southeast Asia's natural heritage.

Tackling plastic pollution through AI innovation

Plastic pollution poses an existential threat to Southeast Asia's pristine coastlines, with the Philippines bearing the brunt as the world's leading plastic polluter. Driven by the urgency to quantify and mitigate this crisis, Dr Deo Florence Onda spearheads Plasticount Pilipinas, a groundbreaking initiative harnessing AI and drone technology. By employing machine learning algorithms to classify plastic waste, the project aims to establish a comprehensive baseline, essential for informed policy formulation and targeted interventions. From coastal cleanups to aerial surveys, AI emerges as a potent ally in combating plastic pollution across the archipelago.

The advent of AI heralds a paradigm shift in plastic waste management, transcending conventional methodologies plagued by inefficiency and subjectivity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, Plasticount Pilipinas empowers policymakers with actionable insights tailored to local contexts. As Southeast Asia grapples with the plastic menace, similar initiatives in Indonesia and Singapore underscore the region's collective resolve to address this transboundary issue. Dr Onda emphasizes the imperative of regional collaboration, stressing the interconnected nature of plastic pollution and the need for harmonized policymaking. In a world grappling with environmental degradation, AI emerges as a beacon of hope, offering innovative solutions to safeguard Southeast Asia's natural ecosystems.

As AI continues to revolutionize environmental conservation efforts across Southeast Asia, one question lingers: How can regional collaboration and data sharing be enhanced to maximize AI's impact on sustainability initiatives? By fostering an ecosystem of innovation and cooperation, Southeast Asia can harness AI's transformative potential to address the region's most pressing environmental challenges comprehensively.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Aamir Sheikh,0.3019607843137255,448947634,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/64a4dedf-a365-4dc3-8d42-cda09093da74.jpg,

Like when you buy a pair of scissors but can't get to them because they're trapped inside a hard plastic shell that requires scissors to open. Or the Apple mouse, with its port on the underside, rendering it unusable while charging.

These frustrations don't make a product bad, per se; they're just irksome. The kind of little frictions that make you think, Why'd they do that?

No standard spoon can fit inside the narrow openings of the typical glass caper jar. Dumping them out risks loss of essential brine. Even if you do have a supremely tiny utensil to fish them out, there's no single-dip solution: At best you can capture three or four in one go, and any piccata recipe or lox spread worth its salt calls for, like, at least a dozen capers. Why, dear God, why do they do that?

This is a story about one of modern life's least consequential but most acutely annoying experiences: getting a sufficient number of capers out of those dollhouse-size jars they're sold in.

The short, unsatisfying answer? Capers are expensive, so producers sell them in smaller jars to make each unit more affordable. But the reason for tall jars instead of squat ones is a longer story.

The skinny on capers

For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.

Straight off the vine, capers are terribly bitter. But someone, somewhere (likely hundreds of years ago), got it in their heads to take those practically inedible buds, dry them out in a boatload of sea salt and then rehydrate them.

Once they're cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It's not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.

Why such narrow jars?

A definitive explanation for the svelte glass jar that they come in is hard to come by. Major caper purveyors Cento and Goya did not respond to requests for comment.

Reddit threads on the subject tend to upvote the theory that the tall, skinny glass jars keep the capers fresh by ensuring they stay submerged in their brine.

Russell Zwanka, the director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, echoed that as a plausible theory.

""I do understand the frustration of a spoon not fitting, and I don't have an answer for that,"" Zwanka said. ""I don't know why you can't make it just another half an inch bigger.""

There is another, more profit-focused theory. It's courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).

Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.

After all, there's little practical value to the skinny jar. In fact, it's far less practical, from the producers' standpoint.

""The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package -- because they're tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they're harder to get into the jar,"" said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.

His take: ""It's primarily because some marketer feels that they're going to look more elegant on the shelf.""

Food packaging does a lot of different things, Zwanka says. It of course keeps food fresh, prevents waste and makes sure the product can be shipped efficiently.

""But we also want to make sure that products are affordable,"" he said.

Because capers are expensive -- and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta -- food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.

Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world's most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it's perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.

""You need the jar so it'll fit in the in the spice rack,"" he says. ""But you also couldn't fill that jar, or it would be $200.""

If you're only using a few capers a year, a tiny jar that can live unobtrusively in the fridge makes sense for most people. Prices vary, but a 3-ounce jar runs you about $4 at the grocery store.

Still, you might wonder: Why is it a that jar so tall and narrow you need a nail file to stab at the tiny green orbs?

Blame the success of Skinny Can Chic.

Strolling down the soda aisle lately, you'll notice that beverage cans have slimmed down, squeezing the same 12 ounces of fluid into a more slender package.

""Consumers see slim cans as more sophisticated, which makes them feel more sophisticated,"" Duane Stanford, the editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest, told CNN last year.

The same thing is happening in the beer aisle, Zwanka notes.

""They've all adapted what you would consider the Red Bull can, because Red Bull kind of started it. But now anybody who wants to signify that it is thinner, lighter, less calories, maybe healthier ... they put it thinner cans.""

Kitchen hacks

Labor costs are the main reason capers cost more than you might expect from what is essentially a pickled weed. The vast majority of the capers at the grocery store are grown in the wild in places like Morocco, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and they are picked by hand.

""It takes you an hour to pick a kilo, if you're very fast,"" says Brian Noone, who runs a wholesale caper plant nursery in Adelaide, South Australia. ""The other problem is, people tend to think the smaller ones taste better...But it's a lot more work to get the smaller ones,"" which are called ""non-pareils.""

Once they get to your kitchen, there are a number of hacks for getting them out of the jar.

A Reddit page on the universally frustrating process is titled: ""getting capers out of those stupid f*cking narrow jars.""

Among the tips and tricks offered by Redditors:

Try a a long metal bar spoon or a half-teaspoon measuring spoon. Other common utensil suggestions: An old fashioned potato peeler, chef's tweezers, a tiny melon baller, a wide-mouth boba straw.

""I use a tiny fork. Like the kind for shrimp cocktail or crab,"" offers one user.

""Korean dessert fork for me! It's a tiny fork head on a long chopstick-shaped handle,"" says another.

But perhaps there's no solution quite as simple as going all in -- and dumping them all out.

As one Redditor said: ""I've never been in a situation where I don't decide to just use the entire tiny jar for what I'm making.""",wishtv.com,news,WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic,,-0.1215686274509804,448947607,1,https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/A-market-mystery-Why-do-capers-come-in-such-tiny-jars-e1711250782345.jpg,

It was a pivotal week for Central Banks around the world, with several important rates decisions shaking the investing landscape for the year ahead.

In what was considered a historic decision, the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates for the first time in 17 years, putting an end to the longest negative rates policy in history. However, as the market expected more hawkishness from the BOJ, the Japanese Yen tanked afterward the decision, reaching the key 150 level.

Conversely, the SNB cut rates in a surprise move on Thursday, making Switzerland the first developed nation to pivot in the current cycle.

In the US, the stock market surged to new highs following the Fed's indication that it will maintain its projection for three interest rate reductions this year, despite stubborn inflation readings.

Now let's have a look at what investors should focus on for the week ahead.

Attention is now turning to next week, particularly the Initial Jobless Claims report due on Wednesday. In an unexpected turn, the previous week saw a decrease in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits.

According to the Labor Department, claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ending March 16, against economists' expectations of 212,000.

Since February, claims have fluctuated within a range of 200,000 to 213,000. Despite significant layoffs at the beginning of the year, companies have generally retained employees, a trend attributed to the challenges of hiring during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.

Investors will also keep an eye on the upcoming U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report's revision for the fourth quarter, scheduled for release on March 28.

The GDP grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the last quarter, a slight adjustment from the initially reported 3.3%, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis's second estimate for Q4 GDP growth.

Markets will be closed on Friday due to the Good Friday holiday in the US but we'll still get some interesting data with the Fed's preferred inflation measure - the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).

Wall Street expects the February reading to be softer, which could support the Fed's decision to lower rates in the coming months. Forecasts indicate that the core PCE price index will decrease to 0.3% month-over-month from 0.4%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is set to announce its Q2 earnings for fiscal year 2024 on March 28, before the markets open. Analysts on Wall Street anticipate an EPS of $0.83 and revenues at $35.85 billion.

In Q1, Walgreens Boots Alliance reported earnings that exceeded analyst forecasts, driven by robust performance in its pharmacy operations and international business segments. The Illinois-based company, which has been attempting to slash costs to offset weaker discretionary spending by customers as well as lower contributions from COVID-19 vaccines and testing, also lowered its quarterly dividend by 48% to $0.25.

CEO Tim Wentworth described the dividend reduction as a ""difficult"" but necessary measure to ""strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position.""

Since the announcement of Q1, the company's shares plunged more than 17%.

Data from InvestingPro highlights a changing trend in analysts' EPS forecasts for Walgreens Boots Alliance for the forthcoming quarter, with a sharp adjustment of -32.5% from an initial estimate of $1.23 per share to $0.83 per share over the past 12 months.

Despite the downward adjustment in EPS expectations, InvestingPro's analysis on fair value suggests a potential upside of approximately 5.2% for the company's stock price.

Another company set to report its earnings is Carnival (NYSE:CCL). It is scheduled to release its Q1/24 earnings on Wednesday. Wall Street is predicting an EPS of ($0.18) and revenue of $5.4 billion for Carnival.

Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on Carnival with a buy rating and a price target of $20.00. The analysis commented:

We see the setup for CCL into '24 is most favorable, with CCL providing what we view as a conservative guide despite a larger occupancy recovery to come (higher Europe exposure) as well as 1) brand and late-stage revenue improvements and 2) manageable supply growth.

Contrastingly, our Fair Value assessment indicates that Carnival's stock might be overvalued, projecting a potential decline of 12.4%. This is in stark difference to analyst price targets, which forecast an approximate 25% growth in stock price.

The state is heightening clean energy standards every five or 10 years, and the next benchmark is 2025.

And a recent New Mexico Supreme Court ruling limits how the utilities can collect money -- including surcharges on consumers' bills -- to pay for increasingly more renewable energy resources over the next couple of decades, something that's not a cheap ask.

So how can the electricity companies afford to pay for new renewable energy facilities or acquire the clean energy otherwise? A University of New Mexico finance professor thinks the solution will likely be price increases and mergers.

40% renewables by 2025

By 2025, public utilities' electricity retail sales by law have to be made up of at least 40% renewable energy. It's an increase from the 20% renewable standard that was required starting in 2020.

And gradually, over the next two decades, utilities will have to eventually be emissions-free. By 2030, the renewable standard increases to 50%. Then, it's a big jump to 80% renewables by 2040 and, finally, a 100% carbon-free standard by 2045.

To ensure utilities are meeting the goals, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approves renewable energy plans for New Mexico's three investor-owned utilities -- Public Service Company of New Mexico, El Paso Electric and Southwestern Public Service Co., which is a subsidiary of Xcel Energy.

With ongoing clean energy plans for all the utilities with commission approval, the companies appear on track to meet the upcoming 2025 benchmark.

PNM expects to exceed PRC-approved renewable portfolio standards in 2024 and 2025, utility spokesperson Ray Sandoval said. PNM didn't ask for any new resource generation additions for either year the commission hasn't already approved, he said.

He said PNM's energy portfolio in 2025 is expected to consist of 68% solar energy, 29% wind energy, 1% geothermal energy and 1% distributed generation. Distributed generation refers to different technologies that generate electricity, such as solar panels, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

PNM has committed to be fully emissions-free by 2040, five years ahead of the state deadline.

""PNM is well ahead on achieving the higher (renewable portfolio standard) standard for 2025 as we continue to pursue a carbon-free grid by 2040,"" Sandoval said.

SPS spokesperson Wes Reeves said EPE expects to meet the 2025 deadline as well. He said in 2025, the utility anticipates having about 94% wind energy and 7% solar energy in renewable energy certificates, a way to measure utilities' renewable energy resources.

EPE didn't respond to inquiries regarding its energy portfolio and progress on the clean energy transition from the Journal.

The court ruling

A New Mexico Supreme Court opinion from this week affects how investor-owned utilities can collect money to comply with the state energy transition rules.

To prove they're meeting renewable energy standards, public utilities have to annually retire a certain amount of ""renewable energy certificates"" relative to electricity sold, as a form of proof that the companies are generating electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar.

If the utilities don't need to use the certificates the same year, the companies can bank them for up to four years and retire them later to meet renewable energy requirements then.

That's basically what SPS wanted the PRC to approve in 2021 when the utility voiced its intent to meet the 40%-renewables-by-2025 benchmark early through banked certificates. But the utility also wanted commissioners to allow the company to charge customers more as a financial incentive to meet the clean energy goals early.

The PRC can approve incentives if the investor-owned utilities meet the clean energy standards early. SPS ultimately wanted to collect $5.23 million over a three-year period from New Mexicans as an incentive.

State regulators denied SPS' request to add the surcharge to customers' bills.

SPS appealed the decision with the New Mexico Supreme Court, and on Monday, the court upheld state regulators' ruling.

""(A)t this stage, SPS seeks a reward -- not an incentive -- for renewable resources or energy that it already has produced or acquired beyond the (Renewable Energy Act's) demands,"" the court opinion states.

The PRC also originally rejected the SPS incentive proposal because the utility didn't put forth any firm plans on how it would exceed the 2025 standard and therefore justify getting a financial incentive. The Supreme Court agreed with the PRC on that as well.

Judges wrote that there's nothing in the law that suggests lawmakers intended utilities to be awarded under these circumstances.

""SPS's proposal thus would have done nothing to expand SPS's renewable energy portfolio or reduce carbon emissions during the three years that its requested incentive would have been in effect,"" the court wrote.

Reilly White is an associate professor at the University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management. He said the ruling sets a precedent that the investor-owned utilities can't charge New Mexicans more money for hitting the state's renewable energy standards early.

""It says you can hit the goal but you can't raise extra money through a rate rider this way,"" he said.

He said renewable energy certificates don't require the production or acquisition of more renewable resources. So, he said, utilities can't achieve the goals, meet incentives and then get compensated for it.

""If the ruling had gone the other way, I would expect to see all of our investor-owned utilities to be engaged in a very aggressive use of these banked credits as a way to fulfill these guidelines,"" he said. ""So it basically shuts the door on doing that sort of thing as a strategy for gaining incentives.""

A costly transition

Meanwhile, utilities still need to invest a lot of money to meet renewable energy goals, White said.

""They have to retire plants that aren't producing clean energy. They have to build plants that produce clean energy or acquire that electricity from somewhere else,"" he said. ""All of that costs money.""

He said raising money is more expensive right now, too, because interest rates are higher.

""It is a very, very challenging scenario for utility companies to achieve these targets,"" he said.

The investor-owned utilities will likely push harder for price increases in the next decade or more, White said.

He said it's also likely utility merger proposals will become more common, a way to allow multiple companies to gather resources and capital to meet New Mexico's renewable energy standards.

State regulators have to approve any plans for billing increases and mergers. In 2021, they denied a request from PNM to combine with Avangrid, a subsidiary of the energy giant Iberdrola, citing risks for customers. The utilities appealed the decision with the New Mexico Supreme Court, but Avangrid pulled out of the merger before judges ruled on the matter.

PNM Resources Chair and CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said at the time, PNM had been looking forward to the experience Avangrid has in a clean energy transition.

White said if a utility can merge with a company that has clean energy expertise, it's a method to get the capital and resources needed to meet the state's renewable energy goals.

""Twenty years is not a lot of time when it comes to fulfilling renewable energy goals that involve a substantial investment,"" he said.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2862745098039217,448947404,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9415511

The airline has a long history of financial struggles but has experienced positive growth since 2019. Sun Country's market position remains relatively small in the industry overa. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

Sun Country Airlines is undeniably a peculiar airline and operates unlike any other in the United States, being neither a traditional ultra-low-cost passenger airline nor a legacy carrier. The airline stands out as mostly a relic of a former, more competitive American aviation industry and was one of the few carriers able to avoid the mass waves of corporate consolidation throughout the years.

The airline was founded over 40 years ago, so it is nothing new, but it still operates out of a single primary hub airport at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), where its headquarters remain today. Despite its years of existence and its relatively large size (the carrier maintains a fleet of over 50 aircraft), Sun Country remains relatively unknown along both the East and West Coasts.

Thus, despite operating to over 100 destinations across the US, Sun Country remains somewhat of an anomaly within the market. In this article, we will trace the history of Sun Country Airlines from its origins and explore where it stands today.

History

In 1983, Sun Country commenced commercial operations, with only a single Boeing 727-200 airliner in its fleet, and moved its primary headquarters to the current Minneapolis-St. Paul location in 1988. The airline expanded over the course of the next decade, adding more aircraft and destinations, but ran into financial troubles in 2001 that forced the airline to shut down entirely.

New life was breathed into the carrier in 2006, however, when the company was acquired by two management firms, Petters Group Worldwide and Whitebox Advisors. Nonetheless, these two companies were not able to entirely turn Sun Country's finances around, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2008 amid the major economic recession of the time.

Once again, new life was breathed into the carrier in 2011 when the Davis brothers brought the company out of bankruptcy with a capital infusion of $34 million. The Davis family, which also owned a Minnesota-based countertop business, would take over Sun Country, with Marty Davis soon becoming chairman.

Yet another management change would take place in 2017 when the company was sold to investment funds controlled by private equity giant Apollo Global Management. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the company faced yet another transformation in 2019 when Amazon Air purchased a minority stake in Sun Country, and the airline finally became a publicly traded company in 2021 after 38 years since first commencing commercial operations.

Since 2019, the company's financials have taken a turn in the positive direction, except for short-term struggles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Full profit and revenue details can be seen in the table below:

Route strategy

Between year-round services and seasonal flights, Sun Country Airlines currently flies to over 100 destinations across the United States, and the airline's route network is constantly evolving. According to the carrier, it flies exactly 122 routes serving 108 airports, demonstrating just how heavily the airline's traffic is routed through its primary hub at MSP.

While the carrier does maintain focus city operations at two airports, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Las Vegas's Harry Reid International Airport (LAS), these cities have extremely few routes. A full list of routes operated by Sun Country from its Dallas focus city is listed below, demonstrating that the scale of flights from MSP dwarfs its operations:

Dallas/Fort Worth to Minneapolis-St. Paul Dallas/Fort Worth to Cancun Dallas/Fort Worth to Las Vegas Dallas/Fort Worth to Puerto Vallarta Dallas/Fort Worth to Punta Cana

From Las Vegas, the carrier operates a few more flights, with two year-round connections and eight seasonal routes, but still comes nothing close to the massive number of routes through MSP. The majority of seasonal flights from Las Vegas connect to destinations in the Midwest and Texas, including Milwaukee, Houston (George Bush Intercontinental), and Green Bay.

Related Sun Country Airlines Posts First Quarter Profit The profit came despite Sun Country facing the third-snowiest winter season in Minneapolis, its hub.

The airline's hub at MSP does serve as a convenient and efficient stopover point on cross-country connections, allowing it to, at times, beat out the fares of other budget airlines on services from the East Coast to the West Coast on routes like Boston to San Francisco. But do not be mistaken, Sun Country primarily caters to low-cost travelers from the Upper Midwest.

Industrial position

Forty years ago, Sun Country's market position would not even seem remotely bizarre, as airlines in the 1980s often had just one or two hubs and would focus their operations on a specific part of the country. Airlines like Texas International Airlines, which operated from a few hubs in Texas, and Air California, which flew for twenty years out of a primary hub at John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County, California, were perfectly normal.

The time and place where such airlines were the norm has come and gone, however, with large waves of corporate consolidation leaving the United States with just a handful of mostly nationwide carriers today. While airlines like Air California and Texas International Airlines were eventually merged into Continental Airlines (which later merged with United) and American Airlines, respectively, Sun Country has been able to avoid being acquired.

Related Sun Country Records Strongest Q2 In Six Years The airline reported a historically strong second quarter compared to previous years.

Even in its MSP hub, the airline's market share remains small and lags behind legacy carrier Delta Air Lines. According to statistics from the Department of Transportation, the 2023 market at MSP was defined as follows:

In its two focus cities, Las Vegas and Dallas, the carrier's market share sits below 1%.

The agreement was signed by Dr. Moosa bin Abdullah Al Kindi, MCBS's Dean and Sayyid Hamid bin Sultan Al Busaidi the Executive Director of OCGS.

The agreement aims to establish a strong partnership between MCBS and OCGS, with the purpose of exchanging experiences, knowledge, and joint work in the fields of governance and sustainability.

The partnership focuses on enhancing awareness of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals and maximizing the college's role in achieving this through its academic programs, specialized centers, and research activities, in cooperation with its international partners. Modern College of Business and Science is a Communicative Signatory of the United Nations Initiative for the Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME).

In addition, MCBS has recently signed the Sustainable Development Goals Agreement (The SDG Accord) with the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges (EAUC) to be part of the international collective movement of higher education institutions to achieve the sustainable development goals. The signing ceremony included the inauguration by Sayyid Hamid Al Busaidi of the college's membership in the EAUC agreement. Accordingly, MCBS begins a new chapter in working to achieve sustainable development goals at the international level.

The agreement includes implementing joint initiatives to support sustainable development in the Sultanate of Oman and conducting joint research in the areas of governance and sustainability of common interest. The agreement will also provide training opportunities for college students in areas related to governance and sustainability.

Dr. Moosa bin Abdullah Al Kindi, Dean of MCBS, expressed his happiness for signing the agreement, saying, ""This agreement is considered an opportunity to achieve tangible progress in the areas of governance and sustainability, and in enhancing cooperation between the government and private sectors in this crucial field."" For his part, sayyid Hamid bin Sultan Al Busaidi, the Executive Director of the OCGS, expressed the importance of strategic partnerships with various institutions that serve the center's role and work.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple (NASDAQ:) CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

There is no question that stocks have enjoyed a terrific rally since the end of October. That was when investors became convinced the Federal Reserve was done raising interest rates.

The Standard & Poor's 500 is up 27 percent since its Oct. 27, 2023, closing low. It's had 20 record closes this year alone.

The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 30.4% over the same time frame. The Nasdaq-100 Index is up 30%.

And the Russell 2000 Index is up 26.6%.

What's coming now that the Fed has spoken

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank still expects to cut rates this year, maybe as many as three times on the expectation inflation is sustainably on its way to 2% a year.

There seems to be a consensus that the first cut is coming in June.

And, of course, stocks shot up afterward.

If traders are right, is there a chance stocks will go, well, parabolic?

If you search the Internet, you'll find a loud cadre of prognosticators saying tech stocks are in a bubble, and a crash or at least a serious pullback is imminent.

Given the big rally since October, the concern is understandable.

So far, however, markets overall aren't buying into the fears.

What one often hears is the enthusiasm for all things Artificial Intelligence. Bulls argue that the development of AI is the biggest change coming to technology since the Internet became real in the mid-1990s.

And AI may be setting off a bull run not unlike what we saw in the late 1990s.

2024 is also a Presidential election year, when stocks typically rise about 6%.

That helps explain why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 indices hit record highs on Thursday, The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index hit record closes on Friday.

It feeds into the interest in Reddit (RDDT) . The social media company went public at $34 late Wednesday, and its shares jumped 48% to $50.44 on Thursday, its first day of trading. But Friday, however, Reddit 8.8% to $46.

Perhaps the worst scenario one can find from people who have watched markets is voiced by Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of The Stock Traders Almanac.

Hirsch believes stocks may be flat for the next few months because it's time. Stocks typically see their best gains between November through April and pause until the fall, he notes.

Jon Markman, a Seattle financial planner who's bullish for for the foreseeable future, likes small cap stocks generally and the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-trade fund (IWM) and energy shares for the rest of the year.

What's coming this week

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So, if momentum is driving markets you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before trading ends for the first quarter. Which is Thursday.

The con. sensus estimate is for the index to show a month-to-month increase of 0.4% in February down from 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, projects FXStreet. That suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization in price gains will be bumpy.

Economists have been low side on inflation estimates lately. The surprisingly strong inflation numbers of late caused Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street took that to mean rates will come down. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

About Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. MS damages or destroys the protective covering (known as myelin) surrounding the nerves of the CNS, and can potentially injure the nerves as well. This damage causes reduced communication between the brain and nerve pathways. Common MS symptoms include visual problems, overwhelming fatigue, difficulty with balance and coordination, depression and cognitive issues, and various levels of impaired mobility. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis is estimated at nearly one million people nationwide, and most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 50. MS is not contagious, and researchers continue to look for both a cause and a cure.

On Saturday, a delegation from the Punjab BJP held discussions with the state's chief electoral officer, urging for a similar probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the alleged liquor ""scam"" in Punjab, akin to the investigation initiated in Delhi.

Sunil Jakhar, the Punjab BJP president and member of the delegation, asserted that the liquor policy model adopted in Delhi has also been replicated in Punjab. Jakhar highlighted, ""The Delhi model of liquor policy has also been implemented in Punjab. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has initiated an inquiry into this matter. On May 30, 2022, a meeting was convened, attended by Manish Sisodia, Raghav Chadha, the Excise Minister, and departmental officials, wherein directives were issued for its implementation.""

The delegation conveyed its plea to the state chief electoral officer, emphasizing the importance of an ED investigation into the matter. Jakhar emphasized that failing to do so would prompt them to escalate the matter to the Election Commission of India.

Furthermore, Jakhar alleged that the purported liquor scam in Punjab is of substantial magnitude, amounting to thousands of crores. He juxtaposed it with the situation in Delhi, where the alleged misappropriation was estimated at Rs. 100 crores. He criticized the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), particularly highlighting the recent deaths of 21 individuals due to illicit liquor in the Chief Minister's constituency, labeling it as a matter of great disgrace for a party that touts itself as being staunchly honest.

It's pertinent to note that Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi and the Chief of AAP, was apprehended by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday in connection with the alleged Delhi excise policy case.

The Punjab BJP's initiative underscores the escalating political discourse surrounding the alleged irregularities in the liquor policy implementation, with the party seeking thorough investigations akin to those pursued in Delhi. The comparison drawn between the magnitude of the alleged scam in Punjab and the situation in Delhi highlights the seriousness with which the BJP views the matter.

The forthcoming actions, including potential engagement with the Election Commission of India, signify the party's commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability in electoral processes, particularly concerning issues of public concern like the alleged mismanagement in the liquor sector.",newsx.com,news,NewsX,,-0.1294117647058823,448946847,1,https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Only-4.5-Hours-Of-Sleep-29.png,eng-9419075

US forces conducted self-defence strikes against three Houthi underground weapons storage facilities in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Friday.

The strikes targeted capabilities used by the Houthis to threaten and attack naval and merchant vessels in the region, it posted in a statement on X. CENTCOM also said its forces had destroyed four unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen in self-defence.

Attacks by Yemen's Houthis in the Red Sea region, which the Iran-aligned militants say are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to take longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.

The head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Muhammad Ali Al-Houthi, said earlier there had been ""reckless"" US-British attacks on Yemen. The Houthi-run Saba News Agency said US and British aircraft had launched five raids on Hodeidah, the area where Yemen's main port is located.

Is it True? | AI Hidden Gems | CryptoRank.io,"In a landscape where technological advancements often dictate the trajectory of innovation, Apple finds itself at the precipice of a pivotal decision regarding its flagship iPhone series. As companies pivot towards integrating AI-powered functionalities into their devices, Apple may be reluctantly conceding to market pressures by purportedly enhancing the RAM and storage capacities of its upcoming iPhone 16. Amidst reports suggesting an imminent departure from its traditional approach to hardware specifications, the tech giant is poised to navigate a delicate balance between maintaining its brand identity and adapting to evolving consumer expectations.

Amidst the bustling realm of smartphone competition, where each iteration strives to outshine its predecessor, the narrative of innovation often revolves around incremental upgrades in camera prowess or processing speeds. However, as the tides of technological evolution ebb and flow, a new protagonist emerges on the scene -- artificial intelligence. With rivals such as Google and Samsung swiftly embracing AI-powered features, Apple finds itself compelled to traverse a similar path in order to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive landscape.

Recent murmurs within the tech sphere initially suggested that Apple's iPhone 16 would tread familiar ground, maintaining comparable RAM capacities to its predecessors. However, whispers of dissent soon permeated the airwaves, challenging this notion with assertions of a potential departure from convention. Leaker @Tech_Reve's revelations, fueled by insights from a Korean securities firm, paint a contrasting picture, hinting at an impending augmentation of both RAM and storage within the iPhone 16 lineup.

As the curtain rises on Apple's deliberations regarding the hardware specifications of its forthcoming flagship device, the looming question of necessity casts a shadow over the discourse. With on-device AI poised to assume a pivotal role in the user experience, the justification for such enhancements comes under scrutiny. In a landscape where cloud-based AI solutions offer a viable alternative, the imperative for bolstered RAM and storage capacities begs further exploration.

In the wake of escalating speculation surrounding Apple's purported hardware upgrades, an alternative narrative emerges, challenging the inevitability of such enhancements. Recent reports hint at the tech giant's potential collaboration with industry counterparts, including OpenAI, Google, and China's Baidu, in a bid to harness the collective prowess of AI expertise. This strategic maneuver, while indicative of Apple's willingness to adapt, raises intriguing possibilities regarding the future trajectory of AI integration within the iPhone ecosystem.

As the countdown to the unveiling of the iPhone 16 ensues, the conundrum surrounding the necessity of increased RAM and storage capacities persists. While competitors pivot towards bolstering hardware specifications to accommodate the demands of on-device AI, lingering questions regarding the efficacy of such enhancements linger in the air. As consumers await the dawn of a new era in smartphone innovation, one cannot help but ponder: If data centers will indeed shoulder the burden of AI processing, does the iPhone 16 truly necessitate a substantive overhaul in its hardware architecture?",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.2313725490196079,448946716,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

A steady, sustained rise in activity would breathe life into the market for initial public offerings, which has been largely shut down since 2021.

This past week, Reddit sold US$748 million ($1.25 billion) worth of shares priced at the top of its suggested range, and its stock soared on the New York Stock Exchange as trading opened. A day earlier, shares in AI infrastructure group Astera Labs surged 72 per cent on their Nasdaq debut. The company raised $713m.

""We see these deals as a good sign for the strength and depth of the market, and that's what we're telling clients,"" said Rob Stowe, US head of equity capital markets for Barclays. ""If these conditions continue, this will push some people who were on the cusp into doing deals this year.""

Strong deals in Europe have added to the mood, with listings for the likes of German defence contractor Renk and Athens International Airport rising after their market debuts.

On Friday, investors took further heart from a 21 per cent debut gain for EQT-owned Galderma, which also priced its shares at the top of its range. The Swiss dermatology giant raised SFr2b (US$2.2b) in the biggest European float since Porsche's debut two years ago.

A sustained reopening of the IPO market could boost dealmakers' animal spirits more generally as well as ease strains on private equity firms who typically rely heavily on IPOs as a means of exiting investments. One banker described the success of the Galderma deal as ""a sigh of relief"" for private equity.

Deal flow, however, is likely to be more of a steady stream than the flood seen in the last boom, which ended early in 2022.

""There is fundamental demand from investors but only at the right price and for companies with good stories,"" said Achintya Mangla, JPMorgan's global equity capital markets head. ""To build a really good foundation for the IPO market, we still need to see this year's IPOs perform three, six months out.""

Since 2021, when companies sold shares worth US$154b in the US as the wider market roared higher, IPOs in New York have raised only a combined US$36b, according to Dealogic data. Deals have been smaller too, raising an average US$151m, less than half the US$388m of 2021.

Confidence in the potential for IPOs has been helped by the recent market rally. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 19 per cent in six months, while volatility -- a threat to would-be floats -- has remained low. This week the Federal Reserve lifted its economic growth outlook, adding to investor confidence that corporate profits could continue to grow.

""To move forward with an IPO, management have to be confident in the economic backdrop and the expected performance of their business -- that confidence is starting to improve '"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of Americas equity capital markets for Morgan Stanley.

Companies expected to go public soon include cold storage chain Lineage Logistics, which is seeking a valuation above US$30b, and cyber security provider Rubrik, valued at US$4b last year.

Healthcare payments software group Waystar filed publicly for an IPO in November, but ultimately held back.

Listings expected soon in Europe include Permira-backed Golden Goose, the Italian luxury sports shoe brand, and Puig, the Spanish beauty and fashion group behind brands including Charlotte Tilbury.

Bigger US prizes down the line include Nvidia-backed software group Databricks, valued at US$43b in a funding round last year and payments group Stripe, worth about US$50b.

Investors have so far shown the most interest in more mature companies which are profitable, or can convince would-be buyers that they will be soon.

David Ludwig, global head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs, said investors were still being careful over valuations.

""The amount of time they are spending with quality companies ahead of potential listings is constructive,"" he added.

""Companies need to show growth and a path to profitability. Investors are very willing to deploy capital, but they're still very disciplined and they're providing us with very detailed valuation thoughts,"" said Keith Canton, Americas head of equity capital markets at JPMorgan.

Preparing to go public takes several months, meaning companies only just starting the process could at best debut in the autumn. If there is volatility around November's US presidential election, that could push some into 2025.

""If the market remains constructive, it will pull more companies into the IPO process,"" said a senior specialist. ""We've been expecting a gradual reopening in 2024 and then if activity continues to accelerate, we will head into 2025 with a deeper pool of companies and a more normalised IPO market.""",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,,0.3411764705882352,448946703,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/X3ED4AWQSRHYDIJD75NENZ3LGM.jpg?auth=34702b4652fc8b3e83e6a460fb829c9c51048756f07be3fb46a3f46789149f1c&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,eng-9421689

The German Consul General to Nigeria, His Excellency, Mr. Weert Borner has underscored the critical importance of addressing food security, education, and housing, while also highlighting the pressing issue of climate change, which demands global attention and concerted efforts.

Borner, who disclosed this during his visit to the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Ogun State, in company of his wife, Dr. Imkefor possible collaborations to bolster agricultural innovation at FUNAAB, advocated for a global alliance for food security.

While delivering a lecture titled: ""Nigeria-German Cooperation: Improving Food Security Through Sustainable Agriculture,""Bornerstressed the need for urgent action, pointing out that while the German government and the United Nations have provided aid in food supplies, it is imperative to seek sustainable solutions for long-term development and prosperity.

He particularly stressed the significance of enhancing fertiliser production with renewable energy sources, foreseeing substantial advancements in agricultural output through innovative approaches.

Highlighting the priority placed by the German government on Nigerian-German cooperation in food security, Borner referenced high-level visits to Nigerian authorities, including the President and Commander in Chief, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to foster agricultural collaborations.

According to him, the aim was to further discuss agricultural-related issues and to ensure there was economic stability in Nigeria.

He noted that there were three major areas the discussion focused on which were to improve agricultural technology, be innovative and make agriculture a business, and foster rural development by improving the energy infrastructure.

Borner, a high-ranking German Diplomat observed the many inherent benefits from cassava, ranging from the skins and the outer layers, which could be used for many purposes, adding that a possible area of partnership was how to improve the productivity on cassava.

Besides, he also noted the ongoing partnerships aimed at establishing Trade Fairs focused on agro-food, slated to commence on March 26.

While commending the inviting ambience of FUNAAB, Borner likened the University to a flourishing garden.

He however, decried the dilapidated state of the road from Camp to the University gate, adding that the intra-campus road and aesthetics were soothing relief.

Earlier in his welcome address, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Babatunde Kehinde, expressed gratitude to Borner and his wife for their visit, saying it symbolised the enduring partnership between Germany and FUNAAB.

He emphasised the University's commitment to fostering collaboration through initiatives such as faculty exchanges, joint research endeavours, and the integration of contemporary agricultural technologies into the curriculum.

In her vote of thanks, the Acting Registrar, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Morufat Dawodu appreciated the German Consul General for the enriching lecture, adding that the University is hopeful it would be the start of good things between FUNAAB and the German government.

She expressed gratitude to all the participants, appreciating their engagement during the interactive session. Highpoints were the presentation of FUNAAB in Brief by the Director, Centre of Excellence in Agricultural Development and Sustainable Environment (CEADESE), Prof. AdeboyeFafiolu; presentation by the FUNAAB Theatre Troupe; visits to the Adire Gallery and the Photo exhibition, as well as FUNAAB German Scholars Stakeholders' meeting with the Consul General.

The visit of the German Consul General serves as a pivotal moment for FUNAAB, offering an invaluable opportunity to explore avenues of cooperation and innovation between the University and Germany.

The Postal Life Insurance scheme, a policy first introduced in 1884, has grown at 14.5% year-on-year so far this financial year -- in terms of premium income between April and February. It's grown in double digits for the first time since FY21, far outpacing the rest of the industry.

Apart from a sense of security for funds invested in a state-run insurance plan, a key factor that has allowed the postal department to compete in India's highly competitive and yet underpenetrated market has been its digital push.

""The reformative steps taken by India Post have helped in pushing the growth story of postal life insurance. Now, the beneficiaries have the option to pay their premiums online, which was not happening a few years ago. Besides, claim settlement has also now become seamless,"" a senior postal department official said, asking not to be identified.

Overall, the postal department's life insurance business has edged out its private-sector competitors. Factoring in the much younger Rural Postal Life Insurance scheme as well, the department's insurance business has grown at nearly 16% until February this financial year, show postal department data accessed by Mint.

India's private life insurance sector has grown by 14% up to February in FY24, while industry behemoth Life Insurance Corporation's premium base contracted by 8% during the period, according to CareEdge Ratings.

The overall industry's growth this financial year until February is 0.2%. The report attributed the slow pace to reduced single premiums, primarily from LIC, and changes in the tax regime.

The Postal Life Insurance scheme is a money-back policy with a maximum sum assured of ₹50 lakh, best suited for those who need periodical returns. It was established 140 years ago for the welfare of postal employees, and extended to Telegraph department employees in 1888. In November 2022, the PLI scheme was made available to all individuals.

The department introduced the Rural Postal Life Insurance scheme in March 1995, with a maximum sum assured of ₹10 lakh.

To be sure, the postal department's insurance business is considerably small given the size of the overall industry. As per Invest India data, premiums from India's life insurance industry are expected to reach $317.98 billion by FY31, from $104.4 billion in 2023.

Between April and February, the postal department earned ₹10,449 crore in premiums under the PLI scheme, and ₹4,138 crore under the Rural Postal Life Insurance scheme, adding up to ₹14,587 crore so far this year, as per the postal department's data.

In FY23, total earnings from PLI premiums had increased 9.7% year-on-year, and from the rural insurance scheme at 18%.

Postal secretary Vineet Pandey and Postal Life Insurance member Jitendra Gupta did not reply to queries emailed on Wednesday.

The Economic Survey 2022-23 noted that life insurance penetration in India had increased to 4.2% in 2021, similar to the growth in the year before, but significantly higher than the 2.7% growth registered in 2000.

As per a report published by Deloitte, India's insurance market is expected to increase fourfold in size over the next 10 years. Despite the low penetration, according to Deloitte, India's life insurance sector is the biggest in the world, with about $8.5 billion collected in premiums in which year, and growing at a rate of 17% annually.",livemint.com,news,mint,Dhirendra Kumar,0.223529411764706,448946534,1,https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/03/22/600x338/indiapost_1665712886022_1711116699313.jpg,

Kejriwal has termed his arrest as ""illegal"" as he challenged the ED's move. As per sources, the matter is unlikely to be heard before March 27, when the High Court will reopen after Holi vacation.

Sending a message from ED custody, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that ""every drop of blood is for the nation"" and that he would continue to work in the service of the country every moment, whether inside our outside the jail. "" ""No such bars exist which can contain your brother and son for much time. I will come out soon and fulfil my promise. Has it ever happened so far that Kejriwal promised something and didn't deliver on it?"" he wrote in his message which was read out by his wife Sunita Kejriwal.

Arvind Kejriwal Arrest Live Updates: Delhi CM moves High Court, seeks urgent hearing on 'illegal' ED arrest

For AAP and BJP, Delhi's politics now a 'wait-and-watch game'

The arrest of a sitting Chief Minister without a conviction in a case -- unprecedented in the history of the country -- has put both the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on opposite sides of a wait-and-watch game. What unfolds over the coming week to 10 days, especially legally, is expected to have ""significant outcomes"" for the political future of each side in the city.

While the AAP, according to insiders, is huddled over legal possibilities aimed at keeping Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal out of jail, the BJP's leadership ""at the highest levels"" is said to be brainstorming legal scenarios to back the ""removal of the AAP"" -- both from the Delhi government and the city's politics.",indianexpress.com,news,The Indian Express,,-0.2,448946427,1,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/cover_0cb7ca.jpg,eng-9415217

Perhaps we should just let the smugglers run the onion market and forget about the government getting involved? But first, a little story about economics itself.

It's exceedingly difficult to run a real experiment in economics. The thing we always miss is the control group, the people the thing doesn't happen to. For economies are large, complex, things involving many to all people. So, not only does everyone get affected by one or some of the things we want to study, so does the individual reaction to whatever change is happening also affect everyone else. We therefore find ourselves looking for natural experiments. Where some change happened in the one place, to some part of the market, but not to others. The effect of that change then becomes the difference in how those two parts of the market reacted. Probably -- see above about economies being complex places.

Speculation and volatility

A standard claim about financial and commodity markets is that speculation makes prices and or volumes traded more volatile. Stands to reason -- if people are betting on the price then wild price swings are more likely to happen. The weight of money chasing the market produces those swings.

Hmm, well, maybe. But we'd like to know whether that is actually true or not? As we discussed a couple of weeks back, Adam Smith thought the other way around. Speculation smoothed out prices in foodstuffs over time. We need an experiment to work out which way around this does work.

Those criminals, smugglers, driven only by their hunger for profit, were actually delivering onions from India at least a week earlier than the minister

The United States used to have a futures market (this is where you can buy and sell the crop not yet harvested, possibly not even yet planted) in onions. As it has long had in pork bellies (ie, bacon), maize (corn), wheat, beef, orange juice (the plot point of the movie ""Trading Places"" which is well worth the time, an excellent comedy) and so on.

Then in 1958 the Onion Futures Act banned the futures market in onions (in 1955, two guys had tried to monopolize the market, the ban was the reaction). Since then onion prices have been more volatile than those of other food commodities. Also, more volatile than they were before the futures ban. Now, natural experiments like this are not absolute proofs but they are hugely indicative - futures markets reduce price volatility, not increase it.

The point for us to take from this, for today's argument, is really just: Fun what truths we can learn more generally from onion markets, right? A 70 year old occurrence in the markets for a basic foodstuff tells us a grand truth about the billions and billions traded on global commodity markets every day -- they smooth food prices, not exacerbate them. Cool!

But are there other lessons we can learn from that humble comestible, the onion? I would say yes. I am using only reports in this newspaper here.

Government intervention vs smuggling

Back on March 5 the government approved the import of onions from India. Our local production here in Bangladesh seems a little down, that in India a little better, so let us move some over the geographical boundaries -- which are, after all, just lines drawn on the map -- to alleviate prices and shortages here. Yes, why not? I approve, given that varied Ramadan iftars are going to be tastier as a result, presumably most approve.

On March 15 the minister responsible said that those Indian onions are going to arrive within a week. Well, yes. You know, government timings, a week, maybe 10 days, but anyway, real soon now. Real, real soon now. And isn't it lovely how a wise government takes care of us and deals with potential shortages that might affect the daily break of the fast?

Except, well, we also have a report that on March 9 the po-lice arrested onion smugglers. Vile speculators, law breakers, who were shipping onions from India into Bangladesh and thereby alleviating the price rise and shortages in our own Dear Country. Horrible criminals. Sure, they were doing what the minister himself had agreed to do four days earlier but as they were not a minister they were not allowed to do this. Terrible, such criminality must be stamped out, obviously.

But now actually think for a moment. Those criminals, smugglers, driven only by their hunger for profit, were actually delivering onions from India at least a week earlier than the minister -- who has all the powers of government at his command -- and given likely delivery times two to three weeks earlier. Don't forget, the minister is making announcements, the smugglers were caught with real live onions in their hands as they crossed the border. Well, ok, ""live"" onions isn't quite right but you get the point.

Who is dealing with onion shortages and price rises better here? The minister with orders allowing onion imports? Or vile criminals motivated only by personal profit?

So, err, if we wish to deal with onion shortages, onion price rises, who should we leave to deal with the problem? Ministers? Government with all its powers? Or base and venal types who think only of price differences, who speculate in foodstuffs? Which works better -- or perhaps, which works faster?

A call for market solutions

The classical liberal argument -- Adam Smith. Ricardo, Bastiat, Hayek, Friedman and so on -- is an intensely pragmatic one. The world is full of problems so let's use the best method of dealing with each one. Sure, sometimes markets don't work that well, nor capitalism. Equally, government doesn't work that well sometimes. Or, if you're like me, government often doesn't work well. But the trick is to apply the best of those available solutions to each problem.

The difference in onion prices between Bangladesh and India is going to be determined by how many onions cross the border

We have the results of a natural experiment here, using onions again. Profit driven trade - even if by criminals because we've said profit driven trade is illegal here -- works faster than the government at solving onion prices. So, if we wish to solve the problem of onion prices clearly and obviously we should be using profit driven trade to do so, not government.

And think on this for a moment. The difference in onion prices between Bangladesh and India is going to be determined by how many onions cross the border. The profits of the traders, illegal or legal, are going to be wholly and absolutely the same whoever organizes it. But if we use the market system then we don't have to pay the salary of the minister -- and his acolytes -- who mismanage the onion market for us. This would no doubt be a tragedy for the minister -- and acolytes -- but there doesn't seem to be any downside for us as consumers or taxpayers. In fact, we get onions, the minister doesn't get us paying his salary, this sounds like an excellent idea.

Finally, as with onion futures. We gain a grand lesson about the world from a natural experiment in a mere foodstuff. If simple free trade -- without government quotas, licenses, ministers and their teams -- is so obviously beneficial when we talk of onions then how much better off are we going to be if we use simple free trade for everything?

Ministers won't agree, of course, for it will mean they lose their salaries. But how about we restrict our consideration to those we actually care about, us?

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.

Yet, crafting effective policies requires a strong foundation of evidence and knowledge. This is where knowledge generation comes into play.

In this article, there is an exploration of how effectively harnessing the power of knowledge creation can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact.

Strategies for leveraging knowledge generation for policy impact

Specifically, sector impact evaluation programmes should be scaled up. This involves deploying a team of research and operational staff to collaboratively develop data and analysis, including through impact evaluation, to inform future sector-specific operations. In tandem, country research programs, which help develop the underlying data ecosystem and enhance the capacity to use advanced analytics to improve efficiency in government processes, should be expanded. Increasing the scope of these efforts would help reduce the costs of generating and disseminating knowledge by fostering long-term relationships with client governments and other in-country evidence partners, and in turn, help overcome challenges related to generating and sustaining demand for high-quality evidence.

ince impact evaluation currently depends on insufficient and at times uncertain external trust fund resources and fragmented operational interest, new dedicated resources are needed to undertake evaluations more strategically and systematically. The leadership could consider different financing mechanisms, each with their benefits and drawbacks.

There are several options for financing impact evaluation and related evidence activities. One option in low-income countries is to designate a share of the regional International Development Association (IDA) window for data and evaluation functions, including impact evaluation.

Where feasible, this funding could be used to support national evaluation and evidence entities in both the public and private sectors. Dedicating a relatively small portion of IDA resources to evaluation-related functions would enhance the overall impact, and therefore represent good value for money.

Another option in both low- and middle-income countries is to establish a defined allocation of IDA lending towards data and research for all financed operations. Integrating these essential functions across all lending operations would help generate data and evidence that is operationally relevant and responsive to a client country's decision-making needs. However, this approach could also introduce some risks; bundling knowledge production and lending functions may raise concerns related to conflict of interest when governments are both judge and jury of evaluation results, necessitating the need for an approval structure where researchers review the available evidence base before loan approval.

Third, the development partners for instance World Bank should also continue to produce research and evidence, including through trust funds, in addition to systematically integrating funding for data and evaluation-related activities into operations.

As such, trust funds should be adequately funded to support evaluations and related evidence functions that are not necessarily project-specific, including studies that measure longer-term outcomes beyond the time horizon of a specific operation, are regionally focused, and/or relate to global public goods.

Data repositories can help decrease the cost and increase the speed of knowledge generation. Tapping into tax data, current data, and other administrative data sources would also help make evidence generation faster and cheaper, but requires greater investments in data collection, quality, and infrastructure (including national statistical systems) to link these data sources to each other and make them accessible and usable for researchers and policymakers.

More equitable evidence-to-policy partnerships would increase the quality, relevance, and visibility of development partner's research and evaluation work within client governments, national universities, and civil society groups, as well as at the global level. While the development partners already pursue numerous partnerships with external research organizations that play a critical role in capacity strengthening and demand generation, there is scope to expand. The development partners currently contract country-based survey firms through one-off consultancy agreements, including through vendor shortlisting and open competition.

Where feasible, the development partners should shift to providing medium-term financing for select organizations with the potential to build their evaluation capacity and expand their client base to interested governments and other research funders.

The development partners could also co-invest with partner research organizations in local evaluation firms to further develop the enabling ecosystem for evidence generation and use, though current procurement rules would likely need to be changed.

Further, the development partners can provide policy lending to support government-based or semi-autonomous evidence-to-policy initiatives, which are proximate to information on policy windows and ideally structured by design to ensure research questions align with government priorities.

Lastly, creating an internal roster of local partners in client countries including universities, researchers, research consortia, and survey firms would be a helpful resource for staff as they seek to expand the scope of impact evaluations and related evidence activities.

Furthermore, incorporate diverse perspectives by including stakeholders like industry experts, NGOs, and community representatives in the knowledge generation process.

In conclusion, the power of knowledge generation lies not just in its creation, but in its translation to actionable insights. By fostering collaboration between knowledge producers and policymakers, employing targeted communication strategies, and building robust knowledge ecosystems, we can bridge the gap between research and real-world impact. This virtuous cycle of knowledge informing policy and policy driving further research will equip us to tackle complex challenges and create a more informed and equitable future. As the world continues to evolve, our ability to leverage knowledge generation effectively will be paramount in ensuring that policy decisions are not simply well-intentioned, but demonstrably effective.

There is need not only to rethink but also to restructure the health sector towards innovative medical innovation.

At the same time, we are trying to answer if entrepreneurial health practices are for business or a calling that turns out to be a free gift from our sons and daughters to ensure societal well-being.

We say there is a need to strike a balance.

While a number of health professionals in Zimbabwe have started shaking up the industry with innovative approaches, there is still much room for improvement in the healthcare sector.

In order to achieve an upper-middle income society by 2023 and attain the (Sustainable Development Goals) SDGs, the country is looking for health entrepreneurs who are driven, adaptable, and willing to think outside the box to revolutionise the healthcare system.

And such should possess qualities for resilience, creativity, professionalism, and ethics, as well as a deep understanding of the local healthcare landscape and its unique challenges.

Factoring into account that we exist in a cosmopolitan global society, whatever innovation we make should cater to a multi-ethnic society.

As aforementioned, being able to go far from confined entrepreneurial and medical practices to contemporary new realities accompanied by a generational sustainability mindset.

As we try to answer the question if the health industry is primarily a business or a humanitarian endeavour for entrepreneurs. We are further led to do a scrutiny analysis of the approaches and priorities of health entrepreneurs.

The health industry, particularly the for-profit private sector, can be seen as a blend of both business and humanitarian efforts, as entrepreneurs have the opportunity to make a positive impact on society while also generating profits.

Balancing financial sustainability with social responsibility is crucial for long-term success in the sector.

Now, let's delve into the innovations and disruptive healthcare models that health entrepreneurs could leverage to further their sustainable investments and drive positive change in the industry.

Innovations in the healthcare industry are focused primarily on improving patient outcomes, increasing access to care, and reducing costs.

The traditional health delivery models have been organised around a disease or a specialty (family medicine, orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology, etc.), but the future of healthcare lies in patient-centred models that prioritise preventive care, personalised medicine, and holistic approaches to wellness.

The last decade has witnessed the emergence of medical centres, group practices, and specialist centres across the country.

While some have been successful in innovating the way healthcare is delivered, others continue with the traditional models with little to no improvement.

Disruptive healthcare models could be a game changer in the health industry and aim to transform the status quo by offering unique and effective solutions to health delivery.

With adequate local and global regulation by health authorities, these could be achieved by:

Leveraging Artificial intelligence (AI) to personalise care and tailor stepped-care models for individual patients. AI can be used to establish AI-powered algorithms that could analyse patient data to recommend which patients receive which level of intervention. This could facilitate differentiated service delivery (DSD), with less intensive support for those doing well and more intensive support for those with greater needs. AI can also be used to streamline administrative processes in healthcare as well as improve diagnostic accuracy.

Remote monitoring technologies can be adapted to help individuals manage chronic conditions. These technologies may include wearable devices for tracking vital signs, mobile apps for medication adherence, and telehealth platforms for virtual consultations. These could help health care providers remotely monitor patients' health status and intervene when necessary.

Innovating knowledge management systems in health care could improve information sharing among healthcare professionals and enhance patient care coordination. Additionally, integrating artificial intelligence into electronic health records can help identify trends in patient data and improve treatment outcomes.

Effective use of patient relationship management systems to profile and track patient progress can also be enhanced through AI technology. These tools can also be used to manage appointments, analyse patient preferences, and personalise communication to improve patient engagement and satisfaction.

Scaling up group practices through establishing collaborative care models involving a team-based approach where providers (GPs with different areas of interest or different specialists) work together to provide comprehensive health care, often using a shared care plan and effective communication channels. This approach has been shown to increase efficiency in delivering healthcare services and can help address the growing demand for primary care services in many countries.

Accountable Care Organisations (ACOs) involve networks of healthcare providers and hospitals that collaborate to provide coordinated care to patients with the goal of improving quality, enhancing patient experience, and reducing healthcare costs. These promote collaboration rather than competition and address the fragmentation of care that can occur when patients see multiple providers for different aspects of their health. ACOs also focus on preventive care and population health management to improve overall community health outcomes. ACOs are often reimbursed based on the quality and outcomes they deliver, sometimes referred to as value-based care. As long as these align with the anti-competitive regulations set forth by the Competition Act [Chapter 14:28] (the Act) , ACOs can provide high-quality, cost-effective care to their patients.

Concierge medicine is a healthcare model where patients pay a membership fee or retainer to a primary physician in exchange for enhanced access and personalised care. This allows for 24/7 direct physician access and a focus on preventive and wellness-oriented care. It is being practiced in various countries, with the U.S. being one of the prominent adopters. Other countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, also have practitioners offering concierge medicine services. These services may vary in scope and cost, but they all aim to provide a higher level of service and attention to patients. Concierge medicine has been growing in popularity as patients seek more personalised and convenient healthcare options.

Green health for sustainability, which involves the incorporation of environmentally friendly practices into healthcare delivery, such as reducing waste, using renewable energy sources, and promoting green spaces within medical facilities.

Wellness tourism could combine healthcare services with travel experiences to promote overall well-being and relaxation. This emerging trend allows individuals to prioritise their health while enjoying unique destinations and activities.

Integration of teletherapy and digital mental health platforms into health services can be a key strategy to reach a larger audience and provide convenient access to mental health support for those who may not have access to traditional in-person therapy.

This shift in mindset can lead to greater success and impact in the medical sector.

Hence, it is only by focusing on improving products or services rather than worrying about external conditions that health entrepreneurs can truly make a difference in the industry and improve overall health outcomes for individuals.

Why is it the Future in the Banking Industry,"Imagine a world where financial transactions are secure, transparent, and efficient. No more waiting days for checks to clear or worrying about fraud. This is the promise of blockchain technology, a revolutionary system that is poised to transform the banking industry.

In this article, we'll break down blockchain technology into easy-to-understand concepts. We'll explore what it is, how it works, and why it's considered the future of banking. We'll also delve into some real-world examples to solidify your understanding.

So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the fascinating world of blockchain!

At its core, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. Think of it as a giant, shared spreadsheet that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike a traditional spreadsheet, however, this ledger is secure and tamper-proof. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Blockchain offers several advantages over traditional methods of storing and managing data. Here are some of the key benefits:

Imagine you are sending money to a friend online. Traditionally, the transaction would involve your bank, your friend's bank, and potentially a clearinghouse. Each intermediary would need to verify the transaction, leading to delays and fees.

With blockchain, the transaction would be directly recorded on a shared ledger accessible to all participants. Here's how it would work:

This entire process can happen in a matter of seconds, eliminating the need for intermediaries and significantly speeding up the transaction.

While banking is one of the most promising areas for blockchain adoption, its applications extend far beyond finance. Here are a few examples:

Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly disrupt the banking industry, but it is unlikely to completely replace traditional banks. Here's why:

The More Likely Scenario: A Hybrid Approach

Instead of a complete overhaul, the future of banking is likely to see a hybrid approach where blockchain technology is integrated with existing banking systems. Here are some potential ways this might play out:

Despite its immense potential, blockchain technology is still in its early stages of development. Here are some challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur:

Blockchain technology holds immense promise for the future of banking. By offering enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency, blockchain can revolutionize the way we conduct financial transactions.

The Delhi BJP leaders on Saturday held a protest near Rajghat demanding the resignation of Arvind Kejriwal, currently in ED custody, and alleged the AAP is playing ''victim card'' to prove itself innocent.

The demand came in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arresting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in an excise policy-linked money laundering case on Thursday night. The BJP leaders on Saturday paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat and pledged to fight against corruption, singing ''Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram''. ''We, the BJP workers, take this oath that we will always raise our voice first against corruption and will always work against corruption,'' they pledged. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva accused the Aam Aadmi Party of receiving Rs 100 crore in kickback in the alleged excise policy scam and Kejriwal of disregarding several ED notices for appearance in the matter.

''... Since November 2, the ED has been sending notices, but they were ignoring it, and when they went to court, even the court completely rejected it and mentioned joining the investigation. Arvind Kejriwal, who says there was no scam, then must respond, why was Rs 100 crore taken?'' Sachdeva said.

Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of promoting alcoholism in the city with distribution of free alcohol under the previous excise policy.

Member of Parliament Harsh Vardhan, who was recently denied ticket by the BJP, said the party will continue to fight against the corruption of the Kejriwal government and have taken a vow to do so at Rajghat.

''Those who swore false oaths on children, they are steeped in corruption. But Kejriwal, who deceived the people of Delhi, must also understand that the people who brought you to power, can also depose you,'' Harsh Vardhan said. ''From social media to the media, they have been doing new dramas for the past two years. With the deputy chief minister and an MP inside jail, and even after ED sending nine summonses, why didn't he (Kejriwal) appear before the ED? If you are honest then why are you afraid of an investigation?'' he added.

Member of Parliament from Northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari said that AAP merits a book written on it with the title: 'Journey! From Swaraj to Alcohol.' Later at a press conference, Delhi BJP secretary Bansuri Swaraj commented on a message from Kejriwal being read out earlier in the day by his wife Sunita Kejriwal. ''But Arvind Kejriwal himself is responsible for this. He used Rs 100 crore received in kickbacks from the liquor scam for the party and as per the CAG report crore rupees of taxpayers' money was swindled,'' she said.

Sachdeva, at the same press conference, alleged that the ''anarchic'' AAP is once again playing ''victim card'' on the stage by creating a false narrative of innocence and by claiming there was no corruption in the now scrapped excise policy.

''AAP wants us to believe that they are the sole guardians of truth and justice and that it's their duty to decide who should be behind bars and who should roam freely. But AAP leaders should not forget this inconvenient truth -- it's the courts, not their kangaroo court, which has the right to dispense justice,'' he said.

Earlier in the day, Atishi in a press conference claimed that the ED failed to produce any evidence against AAP leaders in the alleged excise policy case.

Instead, she alleged, the money trail and proceeds of crime indicate that crores of rupees were received by the BJP through electoral bonds from a businessman, who is also an accused in the excise case.

Sachdeva challenged the AAP to come forward with evidence that it had done no wrongdoing in the policy.

''If they truly believe in the innocence of your leaders, why don't they present their evidence in the court? Could it be that they are afraid of the scrutiny of the legal system governed by evidence and proper procedure?'' he asked.

The Delhi Chief Minister has been remanded to ED custody by a court till March 28.

There's still plenty of space for macroeconomic policies to be expanded because consumer price growth is ""relatively low"" and the central government's debt level is not high, Li said during a keynote speech at the China Development Forum on Sunday. China's overall demand is ""still insufficient,"" he said.

While Li acknowledged that many are concerned about risks in China's property sector and local government debt, he said ""some difficulties and problems are not as serious as people think."" Steps taken to limit risks in those areas have shown positive development, he added.

The world's second-largest economy has reported a solid start to 2024, with growth in exports, industrial production and investment beating expectations. That has reduced the urgency for authorities to add stimulus in the short term, though economists say more policy support is needed to reach the ambitious economic growth target of around 5% this year.

The longer-term outlook faces a number of challenges, including a deflation streak not seen since the 1990s, an extended property downturn and low confidence among overseas investors. Foreign businesses' new direct investment into China slumped to a 30-year low in 2023 amid rising geopolitical tensions and higher interest rates elsewhere.

Top officials have vowed to focus on boosting foreign investments this year.

International CEOs including Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook, Pfizer Inc.'s Albert Bourla and FedEx Corp.'s Raj Subramaniam are set to participate in panel discussions. While Chinese premiers typically hold a meeting with business chiefs at the forum, the two-decade tradition may be broken this year with the Wall Street Journal reporting President Xi Jinping may instead gather with company leaders after the event.

Li highlighted several measures the government is planning to take to boost domestic demand this year. They include reducing barriers to a unified domestic market, granting urban residency to people who have moved to cities from the countryside, as well as a campaign to encourage consumers and businesses to replace old goods and equipment.

He also stressed China's focus on developing advanced manufacturing and technologies, saying new growth drivers have strengthened, and the share of strategic, emerging industries in the overall economy has increased over the past decade. He reiterated the country didn't seek short-term growth at the expense of accumulating longer-term risks.

Li didn't elaborate on how policies can be stepped up, other than outline what was announced at annual parliamentary sessions earlier this month which included slightly stronger fiscal stimulus. He said the country will continue to push for overall borrowing costs to decline, after guiding banks to cut a reference rate for mortgages by a record last month.

Is it True? | Cryptopolitan,"The necessity of this upgrade raises questions about the role of on-device AI and whether it truly warrants such hardware enhancements compared to cloud-based AI solutions.

In a landscape where technological advancements often dictate the trajectory of innovation, Apple finds itself at the precipice of a pivotal decision regarding its flagship iPhone series. As companies pivot towards integrating AI-powered functionalities into their devices, Apple may be reluctantly conceding to market pressures by purportedly enhancing the RAM and storage capacities of its upcoming iPhone 16. Amidst reports suggesting an imminent departure from its traditional approach to hardware specifications, the tech giant is poised to navigate a delicate balance between maintaining its brand identity and adapting to evolving consumer expectations.

Apple's shift in hardware focus - Rumors and contradictions

Amidst the bustling realm of smartphone competition, where each iteration strives to outshine its predecessor, the narrative of innovation often revolves around incremental upgrades in camera prowess or processing speeds. However, as the tides of technological evolution ebb and flow, a new protagonist emerges on the scene -- artificial intelligence. With rivals such as Google and Samsung swiftly embracing AI-powered features, Apple finds itself compelled to traverse a similar path in order to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive landscape.

Recent murmurs within the tech sphere initially suggested that Apple's iPhone 16 would tread familiar ground, maintaining comparable RAM capacities to its predecessors. However, whispers of dissent soon permeated the airwaves, challenging this notion with assertions of a potential departure from convention. Leaker @Tech_Reve's revelations, fueled by insights from a Korean securities firm, paint a contrasting picture, hinting at an impending augmentation of both RAM and storage within the iPhone 16 lineup.

The dilemma of On-device AI - Exploring alternative pathways

As the curtain rises on Apple's deliberations regarding the hardware specifications of its forthcoming flagship device, the looming question of necessity casts a shadow over the discourse. With on-device AI poised to assume a pivotal role in the user experience, the justification for such enhancements comes under scrutiny. In a landscape where cloud-based AI solutions offer a viable alternative, the imperative for bolstered RAM and storage capacities begs further exploration.

In the wake of escalating speculation surrounding Apple's purported hardware upgrades, an alternative narrative emerges, challenging the inevitability of such enhancements. Recent reports hint at the tech giant's potential collaboration with industry counterparts, including OpenAI, Google, and China's Baidu, in a bid to harness the collective prowess of AI expertise. This strategic maneuver, while indicative of Apple's willingness to adapt, raises intriguing possibilities regarding the future trajectory of AI integration within the iPhone ecosystem.

As the countdown to the unveiling of the iPhone 16 ensues, the conundrum surrounding the necessity of increased RAM and storage capacities persists. While competitors pivot towards bolstering hardware specifications to accommodate the demands of on-device AI, lingering questions regarding the efficacy of such enhancements linger in the air. As consumers await the dawn of a new era in smartphone innovation, one cannot help but ponder: If data centers will indeed shoulder the burden of AI processing, does the iPhone 16 truly necessitate a substantive overhaul in its hardware architecture?",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Aamir Sheikh,0.08235294117647052,448945258,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/94ff888d-e4d9-4e51-8112-e76bc539bd6a-1.jpg,

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth. China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio. Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics. A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market. ($1 = 7.2293 Chinese yuan renminbi)

The Conference of Secretaries across the 20 local councils and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs), Lagos State, has enjoined other state governors to emulate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to make cheap food items available to their people through the Lagos Discount Food Market initiative tagged Ounje Eko.

The Chairman of the Conference, Akeem Olalekan Dauda, who disclosed this yesterday, through a statement, lauded Sanwo-Olu for putting the plight of the masses at heart by ensuring that the current food crisis is reduced drastically through the initiative.

Dauda, who is the Secretary to Ikeja Local Council, said the speedy and effective implementation of the programme, is aimed at making life easier for the people of the state at this critical period.

He said: ""The briefing I received from the Ikeja Centre of the project - Tokunbo Alli Primary School, showed that the initiative is a welcome development that'll ease off the pain of the pain of our people. The choice of the centre is due to the fact that it is central and more convenient for the people of Ikeja Central.

* Education Dying, Needs Urgent Intervention, Says Arogbofa

* It Has Multi-faceted Challenges - Shekarau

The Federal Government has been urged to prioritise innovation, inclusion, and collaboration as key pillars of the country's education policy and strategy.

The guest speaker, Dr Olumide Adekola, who is the Senior Education Specialist, World Bank Country Office, emphasised the need for digital literacy and skills for the teachers so that those just getting into the system will have a good sense of it.

""Let us equip all our teachers and children that are already in the system and those just coming in with digital literacy and skills.""

The Chairperson, Education Group, LCCI, Mrs. Mavi Isibor, said inclusive education is the most effective way to give all children a fair chance to go to school, learn and develop the skills they need to thrive.

She noted that collaboration among key stakeholders, including government agencies, educational institutions, civil society organisations, and the private sector, is crucial to driving positive change in the education sector.

The Commissioner for Tertiary Education, Lagos State, Mr. Tolani Sule, said the state is partnering some IT companies to train students. The Director of Programmes, British Council Nigeria, Mr. Chikodi Onyemerela, represented by Mr. Daniel Emenalo, said: ""We leverage and understand that collaboration is very key in improving the quality of education and we know that when there is good collaboration, there will be quality in both basic and tertiary education.

Meanwhile, former General Secretary of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, and a foremost educationist, Sehinde Arogbafa, has expressed concern over the alarming decline in quality in the education sector, particularly the poor culture of reading and writing.

Arogbafa, who stressed the urgent need for stakeholders to intervene and prevent the complete collapse of the system, emphasised the critical role that education plays in national development and the future of the youth and the country as a whole.

The octogenarian disclosed this at the weekend at the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) while launching his book, titled, 'The Psychology of Growing Old: A Personal Experience for both Young and Old.'

According to the author, stakeholders at all levels, including government officials, educators, parents, and the private sector, must come together and work towards revitalising the education sector.

He said: ""The book industry is dying. There are no longer many functional libraries. I discovered that only two of the renowned publishing houses still have my books: University Press and Longman. All the others, where are they?

""Education is dying. I know we have modern technology, but we can't begin all this without writing, without producing the books, and we are not producing. Where do we go?

""This is a challenge for us in education. And of course, without books, we can't move ahead.

""We want to appeal to the government and all stakeholders on how we can revive the reading culture in the country as well as writing. Without the book, knowledge will die.""

On his part, the former Governor of Kano State, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, who shed light on the pressing issues plaguing the education system in Nigeria, stated that the primary problem was inadequate funding, which he said had continued to hinder the progress of educational institutions across the country.

""There are multiple challenges to the education system in Nigeria. The number one challenge is, of course, inadequate funding. We have been making a lot of noise since our days as school principals that the federal, state, and local councils should provide adequate funding for education.

""Of course, we are aware of the challenges; society needs roads, water, and healthcare, among others. But our argument has been that even if you construct your hospital and everything, you need the professionals to maintain them, and you can't have the professionals without education.""

The former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, who hailed Arogbofa on the presentation of the book, said: ""He's trying to conscientise or sensitise both the old and the young, especially the young ones, that they should plan for old age and the old one should take old age with equanimity. I think there is enough to be done for old people.""

The book reviewer, Kayode Ajulo, SAN, who is the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state,

described the book as a good literary work by all standards that everyone must endeavour to read.

Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa of Ondo State, represented by his Chief of Staff, Mr. Segun Omojuwa, saluted the courage, mental alertness, and scholarly exposition, which he said were visibly demonstrated in the book.

""This is even more outstanding and commendable when one takes into consideration his age. Baba is an exemplary leader and elder. I admire his forthrightness, honesty, truthfulness, and for always standing up for a just cause. We hope to continually tap into your knowledge and wealth of experience.""",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.3411764705882352,448944633,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tolani-Sule-640x360.jpg,

Kejriwal was arrested by ED on March 21 at around 9 PM hours after a division bench of the Delhi High Court refused to pass orders granting him interim protection from coercive action.

He was produced before the Special PMLA Court at Rouse Avenue District Court.

Special Judge Kaveri Baweja on Friday remanded Kejriwal to ED custody until March 28.

As per the Probe agency, Kejriwal had skipped nine summons issued to him by ED.

Two other Aam Aadmi Party leaders, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, are also accused in the case and are presently in judicial custody.

Last night, after the ED raided the residence of Delhi CM, Kejriwal filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on his arrest. Since no bench of the Supreme Court was available at night to give him a stay, Kejriwal was arrested at 9 PM and taken to the ED office after the due process of getting a medical checkup.

As per the legal team of Aam Aadmi Kejriwal, who has challenged the arrest and remand, the plea submits that the arrest and remand are illegal, and thus, Kejriwal is entitled to be released immediately.

Kejriwal has sought an urgent listing of the matter.

He had moved the Delhi High Court earlier, also challenging the summons issued to him by the central probe agency.

He had also filed an application seeking interim protection, in which the matter was fixed for a hearing on April 22.

Earlier, ED had filed two criminal complaints against Kejriwal in the city's Rouse Avenue Courts, alleging non-compliance with the summons. Kejriwal had skipped the summons, claiming that they were illegal.

The allegations against Kejriwal are that he was the mastermind behind the implementation of a new excise policy in the capital. Through this policy, he managed to siphon off nearly Rs 100 crore as kickbacks, which were allegedly transferred to the Party Fund.

Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha is also accused in the same case. She was also arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and is in custody until March 26 in the money laundering case connected with the alleged liquor policy scam.

As a market-oriented nonstate sector, the development of the REs has significantly contributed to both China's impressive post-reform economic growth and its transition away from a centrally planned economy. This thesis focuses on examining the following important, yet poorly understood, issues of the development of Chinese REs: patterns of local government investment decision-making and impact of local government on the capital structure of the REs through its capital investment and its influence on the REs' access to bank loans and on the extent to which outstanding payments of taxes and other dues to government serve as an informal credit in the total capital of REs. the phenomenon of soft budget constraints in the RE sector; how it is affected by local government ownership of REs, and what the major sources of budget softness are among local government investment, bank loans, informal credits such as inter-firm arrears, and payment of taxes. the nature and characteristics of transaction costs facing REs and how economic and institutional factors such as the level of economic development, degree of marketisation, the role of local government as well as informal institutions may have affected these costs. The empirical studies of this thesis are based on a set of detailed data from a survey of 630 REs which was undertaken in Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces in 1990. The results of these studies show that in many respects of their operation, REs especially those owned by local governments tend to follow rules of neither a planned nor a market system, but those of somewhat in between.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.3098039215686275,448944129,1,,

Yonhap

The fourth unit of the Korean-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, Korea's state-run utility company said Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.

The monthly Book Review, which had Dr Osasuyi Dirisu, the Executive Director of Policy Innovation Centre (PIC), as the Lead Discussant, highlighted from the book, challenges to market innovations, especially in Africa and Nigeria. It identified lack of political will, corruption, inefficiency, poor infrastructure, weak institutions, hostile business environment and skills gaps as major challenges to creating disruptive market innovations.

Lessons were highlighted from the United States of America, which was bedridden in public service corruption, low infant mortality rate and life expectancy, low income and savings in the 1850s. The Asian Tigers, particularly South Korea in the 1950s, had a high poverty rate, corruption, inefficient economy and weak institutions. The USA and South Korea were able to turn their challenges through purposeful leadership that focused on the informal sector and the non-consumption economy to drive growth. Innovations from Kodak, Ford, Singers, and others created a culture of innovation in the USA. Sony, KIA and Samsung, which originally started off as electric blanket, bicycle and dry fish companies, respectively, kickstarted the growth and expansion of the Asian Tigers, and turned poverty to prosperity.

Nigeria must take a clue from the United States of America and Asian Tigers to create market innovations driven by nano, Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSMEs). While poverty remains an issue in Nigeria, especially in households in rural communities, the solution lies in building prosperity through market-creating innovations. The Mo Ibrahim Celtel story of introducing telecommunication in Africa against the odds remains a motivation for young innovators. The mere doubt opportunities are not seen does not imply they don't exist. Opportunities in Nigeria's informal sector must be identified and explored. This non-consumption sector is the engine for economic transformation and sustained prosperity.

Nigeria must create a sustainable market for businesses before solving the problem of attracting resources and increasing production for economic growth. Government must support entrepreneurship in sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and services that offer opportunities for employment rather than less-employment-generating sector like Oil and Gas. Combating corruption is crucial, but the market can grow amid corruption as no nation is completely free from the cancer. Building infrastructures is not enough for economic growth; a vibrant market economy will sustain the infrastructure and drive real and impactful growth. Nigeria must strive for innovation as a culture and value system.

The World Intellectual Property Organisation's (WIPO's) Global Innovation Index (GII) recent report shows that Nigeria is not on the list of Africa's Top 10 innovative economies. Nigeria is also not on the Global Top 100 list. Market-driven innovation is the new strategy for prosperity. Nigeria must improve its Business Ready (formerly considered as ease of doing business) ranking to create a market that will drive and sustain growth, achieve inclusive prosperity and lift many Nigerians out of extreme poverty.

In these two years, a question has come up again and again Where is the money trail? Where did the money go? No proceeds of crime were recovered from any leader, minister or worker of AAP.""

She claimed that the ED has arrested Kejriwal based on the statement of Reddy, who was arrested by the probe agency in the same case in November last year.

""Sharat Chandra Reddy clearly said that he never met or spoke with Arvind Kejriwal and has nothing to do with AAP. After being in jail for several months, he changed his statement. But where is the money? Where is the money trail?"" she asked.

The money trail, the minister alleged, was found in the BJP's account.

""He (Sharat Chandra Reddy) gave electoral bonds worth ₹4.5 crore to BJP. And then also gave bonds worth ₹55 crores. Where is the money trail? Money trail was found in the BJP's account. I challenge Prime Minister Narendra and ED, to arrest BJP national president JP Nadda,"" Atishi said.

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

Shareholders of Digital World Acquisition, a publicly traded shell company, approved a merger deal with Trump's media business in a vote Friday.

This means that Trump Media & Technology Group, whose flagship product is the social networking site Truth Social, will soon begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Trump is expected to own most of the combined company, nearly 79 million shares. Multiply that by Digital World's closing share price on Friday of $36.94, and the total value of its stake could rise to almost $3 billion (A$4.6 billion).

The green light comes at a time when the presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces his costliest legal battle yet: a $454 million judgment in a fraud lawsuit.

But Trump won't be able to immediately cash in on the deal's profits unless the company's board changes a ""lock-up"" provision that prevents company insiders from selling the newly issued shares. during six months.

Trump's presidential campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

When a publicly traded shell company agrees to buy a private company, the target company takes its place on the stock exchange once the combination is approved by shareholders. If recent activity in Digital World shares is any indication, Trump Media shareholders could find themselves in a situation fraught with difficulties.

Many of Digital World's investors are small investors who are either Trump fans or trying to profit from this mania, rather than large institutional and professional investors.

These shareholders helped the stock more than double this year in anticipation of the merger. But on Friday, shares lost nearly 14 percent.

Trump's previous foray into the stock market did not end well. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts went public in 1995 under the symbol DJT - the same symbol under which Trump Media will trade.

In 2004, Trump's casino company filed for bankruptcy protection and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

Before Friday's approval, Digital World's regulatory filings listed many of the risks its investors face, as well as those of owner Truth Social once Trump Media also goes public.

One risk, according to the company, is that Trump has the right to vote in his own interest as a majority shareholder - which is not always in the interest of all shareholders.

Digital World also cited the high failure rate of new social media platforms, as well as Trump Media's hope of losing money on its operations ""for the foreseeable future.""",exbulletin.com,news,ExBulletin,,0.2470588235294118,448943739,1,https://michaelwest.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7219572f-ff2e-4673-b130-6d61ba53aa77.jpg,eng-9420768

This year 16,000-18,000 new apartments would be launched in Hanoi, 90% of them in its western and eastern areas, real estate trading platform OneHousing predicted in a recent report.

Some 77% of the supply would be high-end units costing above VND50 million (US$ 2,021.4) per square meter, while the rest would be priced at VND30-50 million, it said.

Apartments cheaper than that would be extremely rare, it added.

OneHousing said the trend of high-priced apartments dominating the market and other segments gradually disappearing occurred in HCMC three to five years ago.

""Hanoi will likely follow suit,"" it predicted in the report.

Concurring with this, Pham Duc Toan, CEO of real estate agency EZ Property, pointed out that apartment prices in Hanoi are soaring just like in HCMC a few years ago.

During those years apartment prices in HCMC skyrocketed before plateauing to establish a new floor price, he said.

The average primary market price in Hanoi rose by 15% in 2023 to VND53.2 million per square meter, around the same as in HCMC in 2020-21, according to data from property consultancy CBRE Vietnam.

Secondary market prices rose by 5% to VND33 million.

In HCMC, prices were steady in the primary market at around VND60 million and decreased in the secondary market.

Looking ahead, Toan said apartment prices in Hanoi would not come down anytime soon due to high demand, limited affordable supply and rising costs.

It feeds into the interest in Reddit (RDDT) . The social media company went public at $34 late Wednesday, and its shares jumped 48% to $50.44 on Thursday, its first day of trading. But Friday, however, Reddit 8.8% to $46.

Perhaps the worst scenario one can find from people who have watched markets is voiced by Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of The Stock Traders Almanac.

What's coming this week

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So, if momentum is driving markets you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before trading ends for the first quarter. Which is Thursday.

Meanwhile, there are a few earnings reports of note:

The one report investors should pay attention to

The Commerce Department releases its monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report on Friday morning.

The PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation indicator because it measures price changes on things people actually buy.

The con. sensus estimate is for the index to show a month-to-month increase of 0.4% in February down from 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, projects FXStreet. That suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization in price gains will be bumpy.

Economists have been low side on inflation estimates lately. The surprisingly strong inflation numbers of late caused Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street took that to mean rates will come down. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

What's coming this week

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So, if momentum is driving markets you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before trading ends for the first quarter. Which is Thursday.

The PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation indicator because it measures price changes on things people actually buy.

The con. sensus estimate is for the index to show a month-to-month increase of 0.4% in February down from 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, projects FXStreet. That suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization in price gains will be bumpy.

Economists have been low side on inflation estimates lately. The surprisingly strong inflation numbers of late caused Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street took that to mean rates will come down. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

According to car dealers, this is a temporary phenomenon and there are no insurmountable problems. At the same time, auto market experts warn car owners that they will have to wait even months to get some Chinese parts!

The shortage of spare parts is largely due to the fact that the number of Chinese cars exported to Russia has skyrocketed over the past year and a half. According to a survey by the Autostat agency, their market share rose from nine percent in February last year to 54 percent in October this year.

However, during this time, not only did sales increase, but the range of car brands and models was also significantly enriched. In a single year, dozens of Chinese cars that had never before been sold in Russia appeared on the market. The Chinese brands Kaiyi, BAIC, Tank, Jetour, Jaecoo, SWM, Hongqi and Livan ""officially"" appeared on the Russian market only this year. At the same time, Chinese automobile companies that had already entered the Russian market significantly expanded their model range.

Aleksey Podscekoldin, head of ROAD, sees the cause of the problem in the fact that the supply of spare parts could not keep up with the sudden expansion of the range. ""If you take apart a modern car you get about 10,000 parts. However, only 100 of them can be classified as the most necessary. This accessory is almost certainly in the dealer's warehouse or can be purchased immediately in the brands' Russian warehouses. The problems start when one of the remaining 9,900 parts is needed. And there really is a shortage, we admit that,"" says the expert.

He emphasizes that problems with parts did arise from time to time, with every brand there were times when you had to wait 30-40 days for a rare part, but these were isolated cases. In most cases the waiting time was no more than 2-3 days as the parts were available from the dealer or central warehouses. However, today the number of accessories that are not available in Russia and must be ordered in China has multiplied, and the waiting time can reach several months.

RSA boss Yevgeny Ufimtsev also sounded the alarm when he spoke of a ""serious shortage"" at his press conference. According to Ufimtsev, only the most necessary parts are in the warehouses, the rest must be delivered. He drew attention to the fact that the RSA parts list includes both original and analog (aftermarket) parts, but when it comes to Chinese components, there are very few aftermarket parts, at least in the Russian car market. This means that drivers have to wait 30-40 days for the necessary spare parts when carrying out complicated repairs, for example after an unfortunate accident.

But there is another problem here. It turns out that Chinese car manufacturers themselves are not ready to take care of the maintenance of their vehicle fleet. In the countries whose car manufacturers have left Russia, the system of electronic catalogs has long existed, in which one can record the chassis number of the car, then select the required spare part accordingly from the list and then place the order. However, Chinese automakers either do not have such electronic catalogs at all, or they have them, but they are not translated into English, let alone Russian.

""You think you ordered one thing, but something completely different arrives. We're slowly getting to the point where it's easier to send photos of the part that needs to be replaced to Chinese partners than to mention the name and hope that the part isn't something completely different based on the Chinese translation. "" says Podscsekoldin. It happens that a part needs to be removed from a working car in order to take a photo and send the photo to China to find out what the customer demands.

Another problem is that the model range of Chinese cars is updated too quickly. For example, with South Korean cars, it was predictable that a model with minimal changes would be produced for 5-6 years and sold in significant numbers. The warehouses could be filled with components in advance. A Chinese novelty can be replaced by a new version in a year, although it is difficult to predict how many of them will be sold in a given year, so it is not worth stocking a lot of parts in advance.

In the comments on the Internet, we often come across negative comments about the lack of spare parts, but car owners are also upset by the fact that service centers simply refuse to carry out warranty repairs under various pretexts. However, there should be no problems with maintenance, as Chinese manufacturers are the first to supply the required wear parts.

The biggest shortage is in body parts, which usually have to be replaced due to an accident. According to autonews.ru, many body parts are not available on the Russian market, which also applies to Chinese cars assembled in Russia. On some Chinese models it is often almost impossible to get the running lights or bumpers.

Additional difficulties arise when selecting spare parts for the aftermarket. While parts manufacturers in other countries mark similar parts with the same label so that it is always clear which car a particular part belongs to, there is no such uniform labeling in China yet.

All Chinese brands that opened a representative office in Russia this year have committed to establishing central spare parts warehouses in the country. Podskekoldin is sure that within a year or two the spare parts misery will be solved and the order that existed until the beginning of 2022 will return, before Russia attacked Ukraine, the West sanctioned the country because of it and Western car manufacturers withdrew you have withdrawn the country. The experts interviewed by autonews.ru agree that there are no insurmountable logistical problems with the supply of parts in China, you can get everything, but sometimes you have to wait long months.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,-0.1058823529411764,448942871,1,,

Pun-Arj Chairatana, former executive director of the National Innovation Agency (NIA), was recently endorsed by the party's executive board in a unanimous decision.

He was favored over two-time ex-MP Tassanee Buranupakorn, who quit the ruling Pheu Thai Party after it withdrew from a Move Forward-led alliance and formed a coalition with pro-military parties from the previous government.

In choosing Pun-Arj, Move Forward was prioritizing the development of Chiang Mai and its people over securing political power in the city, said Nataphol Tovichakchaikul, a Move Forward MP for Chiang Mai and a member of the selection committee.

""If Move Forward had wanted to boost its chance of winning, we would have chosen [Tassanee] undoubtedly,"" he posted on Facebook last Tuesday.

Tassanee's family had long dominated Chiang Mai politics as allies of the Shinawatras before Move Forward arrived on the scene. Her uncles include Boonlert, a former PAO chief of the city; Prapan, a former senator; and Pakorn, an ex-MP for Chiang Mai.

Boonlert narrowly lost the previous PAO election in 2020 to Pheu Thai's Pichai Lertpong-adisorn, whose four-year term ends in December. An even fiercer fight is expected at the PAO election early next year after Move Forward replaced Pheu Thai as the most popular party in Chiang Mai.

In last year's general election, Move Forward won seven of the 10 MP seats up for grabs in the northern city, compared with two for Pheu Thai, and one for Palang Pracharath.

Big plans for home province

Pun-Arj, 51, explained he accepted Move Forward's offer without hesitation, having long had an interest in running the PAO in his native city.

He added that his interest in local politics began long before he became the NIA's executive director in 2015.

The NIA is a public organization under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation.

""Although I am a political newcomer, I learned about politics over more than a decade while I was in the bureaucracy. I am a Chiang Mai native, and I want to see my home province develop,"" Pun-Arj said after receiving the party's endorsement.

PM2.5 dust pollution and flooding were not the only problems in Chiang Mai, he said. He pointed to a shortage of new investment, adding that the city needs to invest more money in innovations to boost its development.

The urgent priority was to tackle dust pollution and wildfires, he said. But the city's PAO also needs to address other issues that are hampering development.

""We must stimulate tourism and ensure our economy is sustainable,"" he said.

Pun-Arj pointed to what he said was a general misperception that large development projects could only be initiated by the central government in Bangkok.

""In fact, local administrative agencies like PAOs have the ability to conduct such projects,"" he said.

Impressive experience

Born in Chiang Mai on November 7, 1972, Pun-Arj completed his secondary education at Montfort College, a prestigious all-boys Catholic school in the province, before obtaining a bachelor's degree in physics from Chiang Mai University in 1995 and taking a course in the political economics of innovation at Linköping University in Sweden the same year.

The court will hear the petition on March 27 after the Holi.

Kejriwal's legal team had sought an immediate hearing.

In his plea, the Delhi CM contended that his arrest and the remand order passed by a trial court were illegal and that he was entitled to be released from custody immediately.

The ED, which was given the custody of Delhi CM till March 28 by the court, has alleged that the Aam Adami Party (AAP) is the major beneficiary of the proceeds of crime generated in the alleged liquor scam.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has said that Kejriwal is the ""kingpin and key conspirator"" in the now-scrapped excise policy case in collusion with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ministers, leaders and other persons.

Kejriwal, who was sent to ED custody on Friday by a Delhi court till March 28, was directly involved in the conspiracy of formulation of the excise policy to ""favour certain persons"" and also involved in the ""demanding kickbacks from liquor businessmen"" in exchange of favours granting in the said policy, the probe agency claimed.

The policy in question was being drafted considering the favours to be granted to the 'South Group' and was formed in collusion with Vijay Nair, Manish Sisodia, and members-representatives of the 'South Group'.

""Therefore, not only the AAP but Arvind Kejriwal shall be deemed to be guilty of offences punishable under Section 4 of PMLA and shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished as provided u/s 70 of PMLA,"" the agency said.

Kejriwal's legal team had urged the High Court to hear the matter expeditiously, most likely on Sunday, but the court refused it.",newsroomodisha.com,news,News Room Odisha,,-0.003921568627450966,448942783,1,https://newsroomodisha.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/court_2_NjCoQRI-1138GA.png,

This was the third working session between Hue and the USABC since the beginning of the 15th National Assembly.

The major goals of the National Assembly and government are creating breakthroughs in the fields of infrastructure development, institutional reform, human resources development; and application of science and technology, innovation, digital transformation, green transition and sustainable development, as well as climate change adaptation.

The US businesses and large corporations consider Vietnam a strategic market and want to make long-term commitments and expand their investment portfolios.

The National Assembly chair noted the US government's commitment on considering recognizing the market economy status for Vietnam. Hue said this has important significance in realizing the vision and strategic orientation of the leaders of the two countries.

Hue said if this is done early, it will be a testament to the confidence of the two countries, creating cooperation in different fields and bringing substantial benefits to businesses and people of the two nations.

Hue hoped that the US corporations will promote their role in providing unbiased information, and contribute to a consensus of the US Administration and Congress on excluding Vietnam from the list of non-market economies.

He said that Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and the UK have officially recognized Vietnam as a market economy. Vietnam is now a signatory of many free trade agreements with large partners in the world.

President and CEO of USABC Ted Osius, US Ambassador to Vietnam in 2014-2017, noted the commitments by American businesses in realizing the potential of the comprehensive strategic partnership between Vietnam and the US.

Osius said the presence of many visiting US businesses during the trip to Vietnam showed their high interest in seeking opportunities in Vietnam.

He believes that, with the potential to become a logistics and production center in the global supply chain, Vietnam has great promise in energy development.

USABC has made recommendations and sent a report to the US Department of Commerce with evidence about Vietnam's market economy.

Prior to that, on March 12, US Ambassador to Vietnam Marc Knapper, when informing the press about the investment conference, Select USA, scheduled in June, said that 2024 would be a wonderful time for the Vietnam-US relationship.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.4039215686274509,448942779,1,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/files/publish/2024/3/24/recognition-of-vns-market-economy-status-will-be-testament-of-vn-us-confidence-72.jpg,

If you search the Internet, you'll find a loud cadre of prognosticators saying tech stocks are in a bubble, and a crash or at least a serious pullback is imminent.

Given the big rally since October, the concern is understandable.

So far, however, markets overall aren't buying into the fears.

Perhaps the worst scenario one can find from people who have watched markets is voiced by Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of The Stock Traders Almanac.

Hirsch believes stocks may be flat for the next few months because it's time. Stocks typically see their best gains between November through April and pause until the fall, he notes.

What's coming this week

This week may offer a hint of what's to come because investors and traders will have to make decisions largely absent of big, market-moving events. It's a four-day week because U.S. markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.

So, if momentum is driving markets you should see it before Thursday, if only because institutional investors will buy what's hot before trading ends for the first quarter. Which is Thursday.

The one report investors should pay attention to

The Commerce Department releases its monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report on Friday morning.

The PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation indicator because it measures price changes on things people actually buy.

The con. sensus estimate is for the index to show a month-to-month increase of 0.4% in February down from 0.6% in January. The year-over-year rate likely rose slightly to 4.8%, projects FXStreet. That suggests, as Powell himself conceded last week, that the path to normalization in price gains will be bumpy.

Economists have been low side on inflation estimates lately. The surprisingly strong inflation numbers of late caused Jerome Powell to repeat his mantra that rate cuts will come when inflation is sustainably lower.

Wall Street took that to mean rates will come down. But as one analyst said last week, another high number creates a different conversation.

But there is another, longer-running trend happening in the Japanese economy that could prove interesting for US policymakers: Female employment has been steadily rising.

Working-age Japanese women have been joining the labour market for years, a trend that has continued strongly in recent months as a tight labour market prods companies to work to attract new employees.

The jump in female participation has happened partly by design. Since about 2013, the Japanese government has tried to make both public policies and corporate culture more friendly to women in the workforce. The goal was to attract a new source of talent at a time when the world's fourth-largest economy faces an ageing and shrinking labour market.

""Where Japan did well over the recent decade is putting the care infrastructure in place for working parents,"" Ms Nobuko Kobayashi, a partner at EY-Parthenon in Japan, wrote in an e-mail.

Still, even some who were around when the ""womenomics"" policies were designed have been caught off guard by just how many Japanese women are now choosing to work thanks to the policy changes and to shifting social norms.

""We all underestimated it,"" said Dr Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advised the Japanese government while it was instituting the policies meant to bring on more female workers.

Dr Posen thought at the time that they might be able to get perhaps 800,000 women into the labour market, far fewer than the roughly three million who have actually joined (albeit many of them are part-time).

It is a surprise that could serve as an important reminder to economic officials around the world. Economists often try to guess how much a nation's labour force can expand by extrapolating from history - and they tend to assume that there are limits to how many people can be lured into the labour market, since some are likely to stay home as caretakers or for other reasons.

But history has served as a poor guide in Japan over the past decade as social standards, marriage rates and fertility rates have shifted. And the lesson provided by the Japanese experience is simple: Women may be a bigger potential labour force than economists typically count on.

""Clearly, women in Japan wanted to work,"" Mr Posen said. ""It raises questions about what is a reasonable expectation for female labour force participation.""

That message could be a relevant one for the US central bank, the Federal Reserve.

How much room the US labour market has to expand is a key question for the Fed in 2024.

Over the past year, inflation has come down in the United States, and wage pressures have moderated even as hiring has stayed strong and the economy has expanded rapidly. That positive outcome has been possible because the nation's supply of workers has been expanding.

Labour force growth has come from two big sources in recent years: Immigration has picked up, and labour force participation has been recovering after falling during the pandemic. That is especially true for women in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 to 54, who have been participating in the job market at record or near-record rates.

Now economists are asking whether the expansion can continue. Immigration into the US does appear to be poised to persist: Economists at Goldman Sachs said the US could add about one million more immigrants than normal in 2024. The question is whether participation will continue to pick up.",straitstimes.com,news,The Straits Times,,0.4274509803921569,448942460,1,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/03/24/JAPANLABORWOMEN.JPG,

Korean-built nuclear reactor successfully connected to UAE power grid | Yonhap News Agency,"SEOUL, March 24 (Yonhap) -- The fourth unit of the South Korean-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, South Korea's state-run utility company said Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a US$20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

This initiative is aimed at staying ahead of projections for the electric load on the grid, expected to increase by 60 percent over the course of the next 20 years.

""The Upstate Upgrade is really anticipatory investments, we really need more than that,"" Bart Franey, VP-Clean Energy Development at National Grid, says.

One of the company's projects will start in Rotterdam, moving west along existing powerlines, and finishing near Little Falls. One reason for that area, an anticipated increase in solar power in Schoharie County, as the current power lines need to have their capacity increased from 69 KV Voltage to 119 KV.

""That really is to accommodate a lot of the interest in renewable developers, primarily solar developers in that area,"" Franey says. ""We're identifying a large number of counties that are hosting renewable generators. Those counties, the transmission in those counties, is inadequate for exporting the production of renewable energy that is coming or currently sits there. This capacity is needed. We don't have a lot of surplus capacity on those circuits we're replacing, so that's why we're going to be replacing it.""

Franey says they expect these projects to make millions for the economies of local municipalities, saying previous projects have been evidence of that. The ""Smartpath Connect"" project spans from the Mohawk Valley to the North Country, and Franey says Boonville, who had struggled after the pandemic and slow snowmobile season, benefited from the project.

""In those communities like Boonville, the [projects] also provided huge economic boosts through sourcing cement locally, crushed stone, and hiring more drivers to get these crews in hotels and restaurants,"" Franey said. ""It really saved a lot of the local businesses up there.""

But, some of the potential renewable projects could be facing challenges of their own, as some proposals have come with controversy. Recently, CBS6 spoke with lawmakers concerned over the loss of farmland.

""How much more productive farmland, fertile productive farmland, are we going to use for these alternative energy products,"" Schoharie Assemblyman Chris Tague told CBS6. ""The adage 'no farms, no food,' it's a true statement.""

But, National Grid says regardless of the challenges that facet of the energy sector is facing, they still need to prepare for the increase in renewable energy, in large part due to stat mandates. The Empire Center's Ken Girardin, who wrote a recent report regarding the State's energy goals, says New York needs to do its part to help these companies keep up with what lawmakers are mandating.

""The state needs to make sure these grids, at the last mile, can accommodate all of these folks on the coldest day of the year, or coldest day of the decade... turning on their electric heat, charging their electric cars,"" Girardin says.",cbs6albany.com,news,WRGB,Tom Eschen,0.1764705882352942,448942088,10,https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media/2e5242b2-fc98-4742-9850-2c2ad65cc952-large16x9_thumb_52762.png,

Kejriwal's arrest came two days after the formal notification for the Lok Sabha elections.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was remanded in six-day ED custody by a Delhi court on March 22 after the agency termed him the ""kingpin"" and ""key conspirator"" in the alleged scam.

Kejriwal received nine summons between November 2023 and March 2024, but he did not appear before the authorities. He was arrested on March 21, 2024, after the Delhi HC rejected his plea seeking protection from arrest.

Additional Solicitor General SV Raju said Kejriwal demanded kickbacks from the South Group in exchange for providing favours to them in the formulation and implementation of the excise policy.

""A sum of around Rs 45 crore out of the kickbacks was used by AAP in the Goa campaign in 2021-22,"" Raju said. Kejriwal was non-cooperative during the search and did not give correct facts, that's why the agency wanted to interrogate him further, he added.

Former Deputy CM Manish Sisodia was arrested in February 2023 for his alleged role in the liquor scam. He was arrested by the CBI due to his alleged involvement in the destruction of evidence.

According to investigating agencies, some contentious provisions were added to the liquor policy, which were not part of its first draft. Sisodia reportedly could not satisfactorily explain how those provisions got included in the final draft.

AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh was arrested by the ED in October 2023 in connection with a money laundering case linked to the Delhi liquor policy.

The court will hear the petition on March 27 after the Holi.

Kejriwal's legal team had sought an immediate hearing.

In his plea, the Delhi CM contended that his arrest and the remand order passed by a trial court were illegal and that he was entitled to be released from custody immediately.

The ED, which was given the custody of Delhi CM till March 28 by the court, has alleged that the Aam Adami Party (AAP) is the major beneficiary of the proceeds of crime generated in the alleged liquor scam.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has said that Kejriwal is the ""kingpin and key conspirator"" in the now-scrapped excise policy case in collusion with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ministers, leaders and other persons.

Kejriwal, who was sent to ED custody on Friday by a Delhi court till March 28, was directly involved in the conspiracy of formulation of the excise policy to ""favour certain persons"" and also involved in the ""demanding kickbacks from liquor businessmen"" in exchange of favours granting in the said policy, the probe agency claimed.

During these price movements, Ethereum surpassed $4,000 while Solana rose to the $210 level. So, what is the current situation with these altcoins?

ContentsThe Future of EthereumThe Future of Solana The Future of Ethereum

After the epic rise, the price of Ethereum could not maintain its strong outlook despite surpassing $4,000 and experienced a sharp decline. So, has Ethereum failed to recover and disappointed investors?

Looking at the graph below, it could be said that there is a phase of consolidation. When examining the price movement, it would not be wrong to say that ETH is still moving with resistance.

Ethereum seemed ready to rise again after a breakout towards approximately $3,500. However, after encountering resistance at the $3,491 level, it appeared to be heading back down.

On the other hand, the price of Ethereum did not experience as deep a fall as expected. The price continues to stay above the support level of $3,317, keeping investors' hopes for a recovery alive. If ETH can sustain above this level and rebound from the current support, it could break resistance and rise again.

In the event of a possible rise, the price target will be near the $3,900 region. On the other hand, if the price falls below support, it could bring a drop to the $2,869 level.

Today, Ethereum continues to trade at the $3,366 level after a 1% increase.

The Future of Solana

Solana (SOL) had caught everyone's attention by rising to $210 in the past days, even as Bitcoin was falling. After that, SOL experienced a sharp drop to $162. Then, SOL regained strength and began to rise again. This could mean it's preparing to continue its current upward trend.

According to some analysts, the point that SOL is eyeing for a new leap is the $129.35 level.

Looking back, this point has served as a solid support. If a price rise starts from the current levels, the first major test for SOL will be to surpass the $200 level again.

If SOL successfully stays above the mentioned support level and the market trends positively, the possibility of seeing another rise in SOL always exists in the market. However, if it falls below the $129.35 level, it could be said that the price might search for a new low.

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $177 after a 0.6% increase today.

The sector's evolution from a state-dominated model to a market-oriented approach underscores a pivotal intersection of national policy and global economic trends.

The Chinese government's evolving role, from a major landowner to a strategic market overseer, comes at a time when governments worldwide are reevaluating their involvement in key economic sectors.

Key policy shifts, particularly the 1998 'State Council's Notice on Urban Housing System Reform', the 2010 'Notice on Resolutely Curbing Housing Prices (Xin Guo Shi Tiao)' measures and the 2021 'Three Red Lines' policy, have been crucial to China's urban development. Consider the implementation of the 'Three Red Lines' policy, which was strategically enacted to limit developers' excessive borrowing practices. Despite its well-intentioned design, the policy triggered financial turmoil among leading real estate firms, most notably Evergrande, culminating in their insolvency. Such outcomes underscore the intricate relationship between regulatory frameworks and market dynamics.

In the context of China's rapidly urbanising landscape, the case of Beijing is a telling example of the government's attempts to stabilise housing markets through unconventional urban planning strategies. This has included the significant relocation of industries and universities to the periphery with the aim of reducing population pressure in the core urban areas. While such measures might seem effective in the short term, their long-term impact on housing affordability and Beijing's socio-economic fabric remains uncertain.

The financial models underpinning local governments in China -- heavily reliant on land sales -- mirror a wider trend observed across many Asian economies. In 2021, land sales formed a significant part of local fiscal revenue in China, a trend with profound implications for market stability and sustainable urban development.

This financial model has contributed to the rise of 'Ghost Cities' like Kangbashi District in Ordos. Initially labelled as failures due to their desolation, these cities are undergoing a transformation. Government interventions -- like demolishing outdated housing, incentivising people to purchase new developments and relocating prestigious schools -- have revitalised real estate values in these areas.

An added complexity is the surge in household debt, primarily fuelled by the real estate sector. China's household debt steadily rose throughout 2023, nearing the cautionary threshold set by the International Monetary Fund, with a notable percentage of this increase attributable to mortgage liabilities. This trend calls for comprehensive solutions, including the implementation of stricter mortgage regulations. Such measures could mitigate the risks associated with high leverage in the housing market and foster a more stable financial environment.

The transparency issues in China's real estate market serve as a crucial lesson for the wider Asia Pacific region. Limited visibility into market operations often fuels speculative behaviour that exacerbates market volatility. Introducing mandatory disclosure norms for key market players is essential, not only for promoting stability within China but also in other Asian markets like Vietnam. Transparent reporting of project financing and ownership could discourage speculative investments and help stabilise market dynamics.

The impact of real estate policies on social welfare is another aspect that cannot be understated. Initiatives like China's 'Hukou' system reforms, aimed at managing urban population and housing demand, offer important insights for other Asian countries grappling with urban-rural divides. But unintended consequences such as increased social stratification highlight the need for ongoing policy assessment and adjustments.

In addressing the multifaceted challenges of urbanisation, the focus must shift from solely increasing revenue to enhancing living standards. Urban planning and real estate development strategies need to prioritise the needs and wellbeing of residents, ensuring urban growth translates into tangible improvements in quality of life. This strategic shift aligns with global movements towards sustainable urban development, as outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

While China's resolution of capital shortages exemplifies innovative practices from which other Asian economies can draw inspiration, this approach also carries significant risks. The critical challenge for China lies in diversifying its economic base beyond real estate and exploring alternative fiscal strategies for local governments. Implementing property taxes or fostering public-private partnerships could offer a more balanced approach, ensuring fiscal sustainability while maintaining market stability. Such measures are vital to mitigating the threat of a prolonged economic downturn and to supporting a more resilient and adaptive economic framework.

The Chinese real estate market is a barometer of the country's broader economic health. The sector's interconnections with various economic sectors, from construction to financial services, mean that its health is a bellwether for national economic stability. Policies must be carefully crafted to balance market vitality with systemic stability, ensuring that the real estate sector positively contributes to the broader economy.

For Asia's emerging economies, China's real estate challenges -- unaffordable housing prices, widespread overcapacity, perilously high leverage within the sector and increasing debt burdens on local governments -- highlight the critical need for comprehensive and flexible policy frameworks. Such policies must simultaneously restrain speculative excesses and nurture sustainable economic environments.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,East Asia Forum,0.03529411764705892,448941083,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/a-84-e1687390368712.jpg,

Satellite technology can be beneficial for farming as it allows for precise monitoring of crops, thus leading to improved yields.

Accurate data and analysis can be crucial in predicting and minimising the effects of food shortages and famines. They can also help estimate a region's agricultural output reasonably in advance. When it comes to a vast country like India, satellite technology can work wonders for the agriculture sector.

Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) organised a workshop on the benefits of satellite technology for improved farming in Punjab. Experts shared the benefits of satellite-based technology to improve farming and enhancing crop productivity.

Technology can help in optimising resource management

Geospatial technology is helping the famers to get weather data on their mobiles. This technology has immense potential in assessing soil health, crop mapping, yield forecasting, identifying potential agricultural zones management of water resources, and development of efficient agricultural marketing system. The use of digital technology can help the farmers in optimising resource use and output management, boosting agricultural production and reduce the crop input cost. -- Ajit Balaji Joshi, Secretary, Department of Agriculture and Farmer's Welfare (PUNJAB)

Ajit Balaji Joshi, Secretary to Government of Punjab, Department of Agriculture and Farmer's Welfare during the seminar said that space technology provides effective decision-making tools for policy framework and day-to-day planning.

""Geospatial technology is helping the famers to get weather data on their mobiles.

The use of digital technology can help the farmers optimising resource use and output management, boosting agricultural production and reducing the crop input cost,"" he said.

PRSC Director Dr Brijendra Pateriya, speaking on the occasion, said that Punjab's agriculture can very well witness a paradigm shift in all aspects - land use, market forces, environmental factors and even the employment of labour force in the fields using geospatial technology.

""Digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence machine learning, remote sensing, big data, block chain and IoT are transforming agricultural value chains and modernising operations,"" Dr Pateriya added.

Dr Jaswant Singh, Director, Department of Agriculture and Farmer's Welfare, Government of Punjab emphasised the use to geospatial technology for sustainable agriculture management in Punjab. Various new initiatives like precision irrigation using IoT sensors, assessment of crop yield using satellite data and machine learning have been taken on pilot scale by his department.

Dr K B Singh, Director, PAMETI further said that technological interventions based on remote sensing, soil sensors, unmanned aerial surveying and market insights may permit farmers to gather, visualise and assess crop and soil health conditions at different stages of production.

This is according to a report compiled by Sounds of the South (SOTS).

The inaugural report looks to set a standard for a continued discussion on the industry's economics, which should be done annually.

The report showcases the real rand value of the licensing activities of collective management organisations and for the first time ever, quantifies the economic impact of these organisations collectively.

SOTS, which is an African Music Business curation collective, released this first-of-its-kind report last week. The report unpacks the total economic impact of the South African music industry.

One of the key outcomes of the report is a financial assessment of the licensing activities of CMOs. Globally, these organisations are known to be responsible for monitoring, licensing, and collecting performance and mechanical rights for their clients.

They also enforce the conditions of each licensing contract and collect and distribute any subsequent royalties.

Such organisations play a crucial role in the functioning of the South African music industry.

The work they undertake to monetise the use of music had, until now, never been assessed holistically.

In Zimbabwe, regulations were put in place in recent years in an effort to expand the local music industry.

While there are more than a dozen CMOs in the South African music industry, locally the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) is the only regulator mandated to protect the rights of musicians under the copyright law, they also collect royalties on their behalf.

However, it must be noted that there is a significant lack of knowledge about copyright law and protection in the country.

The report is a detailed look at how much revenue was generated by various South African music industry organisations.

Some key takeaways from the report show that, traditional (non-streaming) sources of publishing revenue account for 75% of all revenue generated.

Despite global collections falling by around 9.9% in 2020, South African CMOs still managed to collectively collect just under R900 million in royalties during the FY 2020 year of assessment.

SOT spokesperson Phil Chard told Standard Style that foregrounding such information was critical for an ongoing assessment of how well the music industry is doing as well as looking at what else can be done to improve processes within the industry.

""The study was motivated by the need for data,"" Chard said.

""In recent years we've seen the explosion of the African Music market and investment from various stakeholders.

""It is important that everyone in the entertainment industry's value chain is making data-driven decisions that encourage further investment, which will then lead to growth.

""We feel such reports have been difficult to undertake in the past because of a lack of easily accessible, transparent and accessible data.

""Even within this report, not all the necessary data was easily available.""",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Khumbulani Muleya,0.1215686274509804,448940225,1,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/thestandard/uploads/2022/10/QEzDAnkf8mwxJioITqgvzG80s6bDjuQoahxzh2BZ.jpg,

The analyst known for his crypto insights, Inmortal, commented on FLOKI, highlighting that it could be one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the ongoing bull market, rivaling Shiba Inu (SHIB).

Inmortal, in a statement to thousands of users on social media platform X, expressed his expectation of an upswing for the dog-themed crypto asset Floki (FLOKI), following significant project announcements and recently stated:

Important announcement on Thursday. Roadmap to be unveiled on Friday. Nothing can stop this train. This is what positions FLOKI as the main memecoin in this bull run.

It is also useful to note that as of today, Shiba Inu ranks 11th in terms of market capitalization.

The Future of FLOKI

The crypto and asset tokenization platform Floki, along with its side project TokenFi, announced a partnership as official partners of the World Table Tennis Championships in South Korea, expected to reach an audience of 450 million this month.

On the other hand, Floki developers recently laid out a project roadmap that includes the launch of a financial product providing a digital banking account funded with FLOKI tokens for their customers. The mentioned accounts will also come with bank cards, enabling transactions in USD, EUR, and GBP.

The Floki Team made the following statement:

These accounts will be facilitated through a key partner licensed in four major jurisdictions: Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE.

The Floki team also announced plans to offer staking services:

We will offer a Floki Staking-as-a-Service program, allowing other token projects to create their own token staking programs directly through our platform.

Amidst all these developments, the price of FLOKI continued to rise. At the time of writing, FLOKI had increased by 3.5%, trading at $0.00023474.

Google-backed EV charging startup Gravity just opened its first public charging location, which the company claims will provide what Green Car Reports has labeled the ""fastest EV charging in America.""

The location is in a parking garage on West 42nd Street in Manhattan, and it sports 24 charging stalls that can deliver a peak power rate of 500 kilowatts. That kind of power can add 200 miles of range in just five minutes or 2,400 miles across an hour of charging -- which would get you from New York to Phoenix.

We should mention that most EVs can't handle anywhere near a 500 kW rate while charging, and no current EV battery could go 2,400 miles on a single charge. However, that much power just means that your car will charge as fast as possible on these chargers, and the system is set up to handle advances in EV battery technology.

The new spot has on-site attendants seven days a week and a tap-and-pay interface with a convenient overhead charger cable setup.

At this point, Tesla's Supercharger network is the country's fastest, most expansive network. Charging times and range anxiety are two of the main reasons keeping people from switching to an EV, so adding more fast chargers that can have you in and out as quickly as a car filling up at a gas station is vital to continue the migration to electric vehicles.

While Tesla is miles ahead of the charging competition, Gravity's recent support from Google Ventures will allow the startup to quickly expand its network.

""If you look at how many (Tesla) Superchargers are added per year, we can add that many or more to grow our network,"" Gravity's CEO Moshe Cohen told Reuters. ""There's nothing blocking that.""

Mass EV adoption is one of the most significant ways to reduce air pollution. A typical gas-powered car produces over 10,000 pounds of carbon pollution yearly. Meanwhile, passenger vehicles spew out around 3.3 billion tons of toxic carbon dioxide worldwide per year.

Carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases are the key drivers behind our drastically changing climate. As these gases act like a blanket warming our planet, the dramatically rising temperature is causing extreme weather events around the globe. Powerful storms, severe droughts, out-of-control wildfires, intense flooding, and other events are wreaking havoc on our lives, devastating our food supply, and endangering wildlife.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.01960784313725483,448940089,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/M4FVhdjm0UoZ6UNqkNapYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/8c54fd2d8f729fd2f6bcb28d049933d8,eng-9413581

On March 8, 2022, a few days after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the price per megawatt hour reached its historical maximum in the electricity market, of 545 euros, driven crazy by the price of gas. Two years later, on March 8, 2024, it stood at zero euros for hours. The massive participation of renewables, and especially the onslaught of water and wind, contributed at times to leaving the market without signal. These are known but uncommon situations that anticipate, in the opinion of experts, what is to come: relief for the consumer and also some concern among investors.

National planning, the PNIEC, contemplates a large deployment of renewables for these years. In its latest review, it sets a target of 62,000 megawatts of wind energy in 2030 and another of 76,000 for photovoltaics. The figures are ambitious, especially when compared to the 27,000 MW of wind and 11,500 MW of photovoltaics with which the decade began. In addition, investment interest continues, as demonstrated by the rate of entry of new projects.

That partly explains what happened this month. The hours at zero price have happened and, from time to time, nuclear power plant operators have decided to reduce production due to low market prices. For the first time since the start of the war in Ukraine, the debate about the inefficiency of the market to set a price that reflects real costs changes sides. Electricity producers and not consumers are the ones who now have cause for concern.

Mario Berná, partner of the consulting firm Ingebau, warns that these episodes in which the price of the electricity market remains at zero ""will become more and more frequent."" ""It is especially dangerous for photovoltaics because prices sink precisely during their peak production hours."" Other technologies such as nuclear, which can close bilateral agreements, or wind, with different production times, are safer.

The truth is that in February renewables contributed close to 60% of electricity production, which is a historical record. Wind, with 31%, was by far the technology that contributed the most, and hydraulics was not far behind, with 14%. Wind has established itself as the great renewable resource, despite the difficulty in developing new offshore wind projects.

""A renewable carom has occurred,"" indicates the general director of the UNEF photovoltaic association, José Donoso, to explain what happened. The rain, the wind and the increasingly less negligible solar production have come together punctually. This rare combination offers in advance ""a snapshot of what the future will be like,"" anticipates Donoso. ""It's the trend. The more renewables there are, the lower the price will be.""

Donoso rejects the idea that renewables can ""cannibalize"" themselves, but he does believe that the Government should promote measures so that their profitability is not compromised. He advocates recovering new power auctions and trusts that the electric car, large data centers and the general electrification of the economy will help raise demand.

In this flowering of renewables, solar self-consumption is going through a small bump. ""At the domestic level it is very stagnant,"" says independent consultant Francisco Valverde. The subsidy schemes have ended, which reduces the interest of individuals. ""Added to this is the lowering of the price of electricity, which also does not help"" in making the decision to install panels, he indicates. The presence of solar panels on roofs is already seen in the wholesale market, where part of the decrease in demand responds to this trend.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.1372549019607843,448940087,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_08251.png,

An old IPO case involving Guangdong-based Liangang Optoelectronic Technology Co Ltd on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's ChiNext in June 2023 has stoked new market concerns about IPOs.

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange had expressed concerns on November 17 over certain details of Liangang's IPO application. The fact that 98 percent of the company's shares are held by promoters and employees of the company and only 2 percent are offered to retail investors through the IPO has attracted the attention of the stock market.

Liangang specializes in optical and electroacoustic communications products, and its IPO sponsor, CITIC Securities, responded to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's concerns on January 16 by saying that the company's major shareholders had implemented a strong corporate governance structure, internal controls and other provisions to protect individual investors.

Liangang and CITIC Securities also drew attention to eight other companies that were successfully listed on the A-share market despite very high stakes from their major shareholders.

The move, however, led some investors to interpret that Liangang was challenging the stock market.

But independent stock analyst Wang Jiyue said such interpretations are unfounded. He said the stock exchange's concerns and the company's response were ""normal.""

Mentioning successful precedents in a company's response is common practice. The point is that share concentration should not be a barrier to the IPO process, he said.

Liangang said as much on Tuesday, insisting that his response on January 16 was normal and free of ""bad feelings.""

His case is being discussed again only because the A-share IPO scene is in the doldrums, Wang said.

Data from market tracker Wind Info showed that the A-share market has seen just 26 IPOs so far this year, down almost 50% from the same period. in 2023.

To date, unprecedentedly, at least 75 companies have withdrawn their IPO applications on their own. This has shifted the market's focus to securities companies that serve as IPO sponsors. So far, China Securities has recorded nine IPO withdrawals so far, followed by seven for CITIC Securities and six for Minsheng Securities.

Tian Lihui, director of the Institute of Finance and Development at Nankai University, said lackluster business performance over the past 12 months was one of the main reasons that affected IPOs.

In the past, the most common inquiries raised by stock exchanges have concerned the accuracy of companies' goodwill calculations, related party transactions and past disputes between the companies' actual controllers. Tightening regulation is another major reason for IPO withdrawals, Tian said.

Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's top securities watchdog, told a news conference during the two sessions earlier this month that the entry in the stock market should be closely controlled and that profit should not be the goal of IPOs.

At a press conference in late February, Yan Bojin, head of the CSRC's public offering supervision department, said the regulator had strengthened supervision across the full spectrum of IPOs and would adopt strict penalties for fraud financial transactions and fraudulent IPOs. On-site inspections of IPO applicants will increase significantly, he said.

On-site supervision is of great importance to ensure the quality of a float at the beginning of the registration-based IPO mechanism. It is crucial to ensure that the IPO applicant's information about its assets, tax situation and shareholder structure is truthful. In this regard, supervision can be of great help, said Tian of Nankai University.

Dong Zhongyun, chief economist at China AVIC Securities, said tighter regulatory control over IPOs can reduce the number of disqualified and risky companies in the market. Systemic risks and volatility of the A-share market will thus be effectively reduced and investors' interests can be better protected, he said.

Tian Xuan, associate dean of the PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University, said financial intermediaries, who are the ""gatekeepers"" of the capital market serving direct financing, should better shoulder their responsibilities by only selecting truly qualified candidates for the IPO.",exbulletin.com,news,ExBulletin,,0.3254901960784313,448940073,1,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202403/23/65fe196aa31082fc2b6af53d.jpeg,

Many companies are aggressively promoting green skills and talent as well.

A 2024 Capgemini report on global investment trends suggests over 52% of organisations are expected to increase their investments in sustainability in the next two years.

Said Sunil Chemmankotil, CEO, Teamlease Digital, which offers specialised staffing and solutions, ""Sustainability and green initiatives have become top priorities across sectors, leading to consistent growth in green industries and a rising demand for skilled professionals. The employment outlook in these sectors is optimistic, with a potential for India to generate 35 million green jobs by 2047.""

The TeamLease Digital's Green Industry Outlook report found that between 2022 and 2023, the share of green talent in the workforce rose by 12.3%, while job postings requiring at least one green skill rose by 22.4%. The rising demand for green jobs saw cities like Delhi-NCR with year-on-year (YoY) growth of 289%, Mumbai (216%) and Bengaluru (174%) driving the change.

As per Vaishali Nigam Sinha, co-founder and chairperson, sustainability, ReNew, a renewable energy company, ""Some examples like engineering and technical skills can be employed in eco-building, renewable energy design, and energy-saving R&D projects. Science skills, which are in high demand, are being enlisted during the early stages of the value chains and in the utility sector. Operation management along with monitoring skills for firms operating in polluting sectors are some other instances where green skills can be utilised to a great effect. With companies increasingly transitioning to clean energy, the need for developing these skills and nurturing talent is critical. As governments and businesses around the world race to meet their climate goals, recruiting talent equipped with green skills will be the need of the hour.""

The LinkedIn Global Green Skills Report 2023 suggested a shift to green skills and jobs is underway on the platform, based on the activity of more than 930 million LinkedIn users worldwide. The share of green talent increased from 9.6% in 2015, to 13.3% in 2021 (a growth rate of 38.5%). The LinkedIn 2023 Global Green Skills Report shows that the share of green talent across 48 countries grew by an average of 12.3% between 2022 and 2023, but the proportion of job postings requiring at least one green skill was up by 22.4%.

In green sectors, the TeamLease report showed optimistic findings, with the potential to create 35 million green jobs by 2047, doubling the current count of 18.52 million green jobs in India. A significant driver of this growth is the gig workforce in green jobs, which saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2%, surging from 2.9 million in 2022-2023 to an anticipated 7.05 million by 2029-2030.

Aluminium producer Vedanta Aluminium is committed to achieve net zero by 2050, adopting a two-fold strategy of reducing and offsetting carbon footprint. For the brand, green skills take on several forms, ranging from engineering and science skills to operations and analytics.

""Given the vast scope of business, the prospect of deploying personnel with such skill sets is extensive as they can contribute in several areas towards reducing environmental impact -- be it by building future-ready power plants, developing energy-efficient tech, decarbonising value chains or augmenting efforts to produce green metal.

However, no official action has been taken yet.

The City of Abilene assigns take-home vehicles to employees in mission-critical positions. These employees are required to take a city-owned vehicle home to shorten response time if they are called to service after hours.

Throughout the years, the City Council has given guidance on how to best do this, and City Manager Robert Hanna is requesting a formal council policy for the use of take-home vehicles.

""We've had rings of five miles and then 10 miles. The problem with that is when you get an employee who lives six miles out, everybody is like, what do we do? He is outside the ring, but he needs the vehicle. It is a difficult and unwieldy thing. Counsel has never set a hard-fast policy on this. I'm asking you all to make my job easy and tell me what you want. Set a policy,"" Hannah said during the 2024 City Council Retreat.

Abilene councilman launches community campaign to clean up litter around town

Currently, the city owns 149 take-home vehicles, divided into two classes: assigned to specific employees and multi-use.

94 vehicles are assigned to specific employees, while 55 are for general use. Only five of the general-use vehicles leave the city limits, while 30 of the assigned vehicles consistently travel outside the city limits.

Hanna stated that the City Council should limit vehicles from leaving city limits.

""We minimize the number of vehicles that have to go outside the city limits, but the city manager has the discretion to make assignments for employees to take a vehicle outside city limits on a take-home standpoint where the needs justify the demand,"" Hanna said. ""For example, this is why APD has so many take-home vehicles. We've got a S.W.A.T. response for a multicounty radius. You have the bomb squad - they get funding through state and federal dollars because they are responding to a multicounty radius. The concept is that if you get a call for the bomb squad, not all of them need to go back to PD, get in the bomb truck, and go. They can start heading towards the response call where they need to be going. Someone will meet them -- the same thing with the S.W.A.T. team.""

Hanna is seeking clear direction from the city council as to what they want to see.

""One of the things I've heard consistently in my nine years is they do not like seeing patrol Tahoes or water trucks or whatever driving to Ovalo, and I can understand that,"" Hanna said.

City of Abilene to begin multi-million dollar master drainage plan to combat 'ongoing problem' with flooding

Place 5 Councilman Kyle McAlister agreed with Hanna, though he is unsure how to address it at this time.

""I am with you. I scratch my head when I'm in an outlying community and see one of our vehicles there. It doesn't make sense to me. I think as long as we take care of the things that are required, the bomb squad, the S.W.A.T. team, or whatever, I don't want us to do things just because it is convenient; it makes it easier,"" McAlister said. ""These are tax dollars we are dealing with. This is wear and tear on these vehicles and gasoline costs. All that stuff is eventually passed on to the taxpayer. I think a good standard policy that gives you definite lanes and definite guidelines is very important for us... I don't know that I have a specific because there are so many moving pieces to that. I think it is important we figure out a way to address this.""

Place 1 Councilman Shane Price questioned the frequency of emergency responses outside the city limits and how the use of city vehicles to commute each day affects their wear and tear.

""I understand the need for the response, but out of a quarter, how many emergency responses are there outside of the city limits by the bomb squad? Any other that would need water -- anything that has to go and make a response versus the daily wear and tear that is added to the vehicle, reducing its life and requiring replacement sooner. That has just been the hurdle that I've had a difficult time overcoming is opening this up to say, well, let's just let people do it because it's convenient,"" Price said.

Hanna has proposed a policy for the council to take a look at.

""When I drafted this, it seemed to me that that is the heart of the issue. And so there are two things. The first statement says take-home vehicles should only be assigned to further expedite response to a city emergency. Two, it is the express intent of the city council to restrict the number of take-home vehicles assigned to personnel that live outside the corporate limits of the city to as few vehicles as possible to meet the public safety needs of the city. Those two are key components of the policy statement,"" said Hanna. ""In conversations with the chief, he has said absolutely we will have a mechanism whereby if you are a patrol officer and you have your own Tahoe assigned to you, and you live in Hamlin or whatever, you are not driving to Hamlin every night. You have to stop at a designated location within the city limits. You can exchange your personal vehicle and go, or you can leave your personal vehicle at the station. It is not leaving the city limits,"" Hanna shared.

When to watch 'once in a multi-generation' solar eclipse across the Big Country

Officers who live within city limits may take the Tahoe home, which, according to Hanna, provides a number of benefits, such as letting the community see the police presence in the neighborhood and incentivizing officers to live within the city limits.

Place 4 Councilman Brian Yates shared another factor: seeing exactly which vehicles need to respond quickly.

""So, police officers, that makes sense. They need their vehicle to be able to do their job. If all you are trying to do is get a body to a place, and then somebody else is bringing the gear for the bomb squad or something like that, you don't need that vehicle at the location; You need the person,"" Yates said. ""Has there been any look at mileage instead of a take-home vehicle? Compensate the individual for using their personal vehicle to reach the location. Just pay them the standard government mileage, and you offset that mileage cost with a reduced number of vehicles or maybe less wear and tear on the existing vehicles, something that like.""

Place 2 Councilman Lynn Beard, who has spent time on the bomb squad and a significant amount of time responding to child abuse and homicide cases after hours, brought an insider's perspective.

""Time is of the essence in those scenarios. The detectives who work in those cases typically carry a lot of gear in their trunks, as opposed to driving to the station, picking up a bunch of stuff, and going. I've been the guy standing in the parking lot looking at my watch, waiting for personnel to arrive at a scene so we can get to work. Unnecessary delays cause problems. I think there are two criteria you have to look at when you are evaluating a take-home car policy,"" Beard shared. ""One, not every response needs to be an emergency. It is just not. Not every division responds to emergencies. They're very different dynamics from division to division. In terms of the time being of the essence to get to the scene, the bomb squad, for example, really drives straight to the same. They go to the station where all their equipment is except for one pickup carrying a bunch of things. The S.W.A.T. team has to respond from wherever they live, right to the scene, wherever it is within 21 counties of Abilene. CID is the same way. Wherever they live, they don't go to the station and pick up a bunch of stuff; they go straight to the scene.""

Beard mentioned a federal evaluation from each department head in the city to recommend who needs a take-home vehicle and justify the need. He also proposed creating a blanket city boundary.

""You have to take into account the mission-critical nature of that person to be able to leave from their house and drive to the scene. How far away from the city limits are we willing to allow that to be?"" Beard shared. ""We went through a time when we had an officer who lived in Sweetwater and was driving from 15 to 20 years ago, which is not reasonable. You can't live 45 miles from Abilene and respond. It takes you an hour to get here; you are not responding in an emergency nature anyway. We had a 25-mile boundary at one time. Is it from the city limits or the center of town? We had those discussions. So, firming those up from a policy perspective, are we going to use city hall as the marking point or use the city limit as the marking point?""

Abilene police warn of rise in 'cloned vehicle' scams

In response, Hanna shared that department heads have identified positions that need or do not need a vehicle. He added that the boundary lines could also raise some questions that need to be addressed.

""The challenge is with our current policy, it is a circle. And you get somebody who lives just outside the circle, but there is an exigent need for them to have that vehicle. A legitimate need. It is a S.W.A.T. officer. Are we really going to say, 'I'm sorry you cannot drive that vehicle even though you live on the other side of the street from the boundary line?' So, you are creating a false sense of direction when you do that. I'm telling you, I'm going to approve that even though it violates council policy because it is a common sense approach. It is not five miles out; it is literally up the street,"" Hanna said. ""The policy I've written as the first two statements and the third one is that no employee who resides outside these corporate limits of the city shall take a vehicle assigned for their permanent or temporary use without the express written permission of the city manager. Such permission shall be renewed annually.""

03/23/24 2:15 PM ET

Three visitors sued the National Park Service (NPS) over their policy of prohibiting cash payments at various locations around the country. Elizabeth Dasburg from Georgia, Esther van der Werf of California and Toby Stover of New York filed a lawsuit in early March, alleging the park service's cashless policy is violating the federal law.

The trio said they were not able to use cash when visiting monuments, national parks and other locations in the U.S. Since U.S. currency is ""legal tender for all public charges,"" NPS's policy of refusing it at some locations is infringing on federal law, the lawsuit filed on March 6 alleges.

NPS's ""violation"" cannot be ""overlooked,"" the suit argues, although the plaintiffs are not asking the court ""to prohibit NPS from accepting credit cards, debit cards, or digital payment methods (such as ApplePay) should visitors to NPS sites prefer to use them."" The plaintiffs' cash payments were rejected in Georgia, Arizona and New York.

Van der Werf was allegedly barred entry at three different locations in Arizona run by the federal agency. Stover was not able to tour New York's Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Site after attempting to use $10 in cash for the tour. NPS does not accept cash payments at 29 locations, according to the lawsuit.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on March 23 moved the Delhi High Court challenging his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the liquor policy case, news agency PTI reported.

The Delhi High Court has denied urgent listing of the plea filed Kejriwal challenging his arrest and custody in the case. The matter will be listed on reopening on Wednesday.

Sources in his Aam Aadmi Party said his legal team would request the High Court to hear the matter urgently, preferably on March 24, the PTI report added further.

The AAP chief is in ED custody till March 28, following his arrest on May 21 evening, by the agency in connection with the case.

Kejriwal was arrested by the federal agency after skipping nine summons issued to him. The Delhi Chief Minister was instructed to appear before the agency. However, he consistently skipped all summons, contending that they were ""illegal"" and politically motivated.

It may be noted that AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh are already in judicial custody in connection with the excise policy case.

The arrest, the first of a sitting Chief Minister, came after the Delhi High Court refused to grant protection to the AAP national convenor from any coercive action by the agency.

Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal issued a video statement on March 23 where she read out his message written while being in the custody of the ED.

""My dear countrymen, I have been arrested. Whether I am inside the jail or outside, I will continue to serve the country. My entire life is dedicated to the country.

According to a prediction, FLOKI is expected to see a notable increase above the $0.003 level by 2025. Before this period, FLOKI is also on the verge of market growth.

The optimistic sentiment surrounding FLOKI is based on increasing community support, innovative ecosystem developments, diversification of use, and a firm commitment to adoption.

Recently, it was announced that FLOKI would be gaining a new position in the banking sector. FLOKI has taken a new step regarding a Visa and Mastercard-based bank card system.

Following the recent surge by 2024, FLOKI surpassed the $0.00103 level. After the price increase, analysts believe a possible mega bull rally could trigger a move towards the $0.003 level for FLOKI.

During this time frame, initiatives centered around the community and strategic partnerships play a significant role in supporting FLOKI's potential rise. These contribute to a more attractive investor confidence and market sensitivity towards projects that provide tangible value and benefit.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.

Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.

That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now. Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.

In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities. Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.

The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices. Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.

The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week. Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools. She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.

Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year. European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.

""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday. BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

It is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time. ""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple. ""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said. He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.

""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets. ""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.

Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year. Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.

""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.

A Macedon Ranges homestead featuring its very own racecourse is galloping towards a sale after being listed with a $3.5m-$3.7m asking range.

Fittingly known as The Racecourse, the 36.02ha Lancefield property including a Victorian-style house is owned by prominent harness racing trainer Rodney Petroff.

The site's 1600m racetrack served as Lancefield's racecourse from the 1870s to the 1930s.

Local legend has it that notorious Melbourne gangster Squizzy Taylor frequented two-up games after racing meets.

Ray White Sunbury's Joshua Reeves says Petroff reinvigorated the racetrack which he uses for training horses.

""It's a rare opportunity to acquire a full-sized racetrack that has historical value, it's not something you're going to get again,"" Mr Reeves says.

Multiple paddocks, an eight-box stable complex with a separate feed and tack room, a hot and cold wash bay and a sand-covered round yard are among the modern-day equestrian facilities at the five-bedroom, two-bathrooms property.

In 2000, its previous owners built the house set amid landscaped gardens, oak and elm trees and a water fountain.

A stained-glass front door leads, on the right, to the home's living and library area with sash windows and an open fireplace.

To the left, the formal dining room has a Cheminees Philippe double fireplace.

Adding ambience is the 3.35m-high ceilings, detailed dado wallpaper and a kitchen containing

granite benchtops and a walk-in pantry.

The main bedroom suite offers an ensuite and built-in wardrobe.

""My favourite feature is the arched windows in the master bedroom, they provide a framework for the spectacular views out to Mt William and the racetrack which are amazing,"" Mr Reeve says.

The Racecourse is also ideal for entertaining thanks to its 12m-long solar and gas-heated pool, an undercover outdoor area, spa and pool room, he added.

""There's plenty of space for intimate gatherings and also grand large-scale events,"" he said.

A business hosting events like weddings could make use of the picturesque grounds, subject to council approval.

Other features include a 20-panel solar power system, machinery shed and cattle yards and crush, plus a water bore and three 15,000-gallon tanks.

It can be used while the pumping application is not appropriate with the use of a centrifugal pump. For instance, PC pumps are suitable when the liquid contains higher viscosity or thickness, as compared to water.

In terms of PC pumps, the volumetric and mechanical efficiency goes up while the viscosity of liquid increases and produces more flow. Hence, it is ideal for liquids with higher viscosities, such as oil & gas applications.

Your Depot After Dark for March 23.

T.J. Watt Honored At 101 Awards

Pittsburgh Steelers OLB T.J. Watt was honored at the 101 Awards last night, winning the AFC Defensive Player of the Year award. It's the third time Watt has won the Award, and Steelers DL coach Karl Dunbar was present at the ceremony when Watt accepted his award at the ceremony in Kansas City. The Steelers' Twitter account posted a picture.

Watt was snubbed of the AP Defensive Player of the Year award, losing to Cleveland Browns DE Myles Garrett. The 101 Awards got it right though, and Watt was deservedly honored. Micah Parsons won the NFC Defensive Player of the Year.

Wilson Catches March Madness

It's all working out well for new Pittsburgh Steelers QB Russell Wilson. Signing with Pittsburgh, his NC State Wolfpack spent their first round of the NCAA Tournament in Pittsburgh. Wilson took in tonight's action against 14 seeded Oakland, a game going down to the wire.

Wilson played at NC State from 2008 to 2010, throwing for over 8,500 yards and 76 touchdowns. He still ranks fourth in school history in passing yards and second in touchdowns, the latter only trailing Philip Rivers.

Mitch Trubisky House On The Market

After Russell Wilson sold his Denver house and Kenny Pickett put his Pittsburgh-area house on the market, Mitch Trubisky followed suit. Trubisky's Edgeworth home is on the market for $1.9 million, per WPXI. The house is on over half an acre of land and features four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms.

Trubisky signed with the Buffalo Bills earlier in this offseason, and he'll look to have success backing up Josh Allen for the second time in his career. Trubisky spent a season with the Bills before signing with Pittsburgh ahead of the 2022 season.

Justin Fields Named NFL's Top Backup

The betting service FanDuel released their list of top backups in the NFL, and they had recently acquired Steelers quarterback Justin Fields at No. 1 on the list.

Of the 10 quarterbacks on the list, nine of them changed teams this offseason, including former Steelers QB Kenny Pickett, who came in at No. 6. The only quarterback who was with their current team in the 2023 season was Cowboys QB Trey Lance, who was traded to Dallas ahead of Week One last year.

The only other AFC North quarterback on the list was Jameis Winston, who signed with the Cleveland Browns this offseason. Fields and Mac Jones, who came in at No. 5, were both first-round picks in the 2021 NFL Draft, while Pickett along with Desmond Ridder were both selected in the 2022 NFL Draft.

Fields will backup Russell Wilson this season, and there's a chance he could be Pittsburgh's quarterback of the future after spending the last two seasons as the primary starter for the Chicago Bears.

Every Chick-fil-A restaurant has served antibiotic-free chicken meat since 2019 but will switch over at an unspecified date this spring. Still, the franchise will follow the practice of No Antibiotics Important To Human Medicine. The absence of antibiotics found in human medicine prevents people from developing a resistance to them via consumption. Antibiotics will only be provided to the chickens if they get sick or are exposed to illness.

""We established an Animal Wellbeing Council of outside experts, which provides feedback on our policies and practices,"" Chick-fil-A's website reads. ""With their input, we are constantly evaluating our approach to animal wellbeing to ensure it is consistent with or exceeds industry standards.""

The move comes after Tyson Foods also switched from No Antibiotics Ever to No Antibiotics Important To Human Medicine last year.

The restaurant's chickens are sourced in the United States and do not have added fillers, artificial preservatives, steroids, or added hormones.

There are 3,000 Chick-fil-A locations nationwide. The company has plans to expand to Europe and Asia in 2023.

Previously, I wrote that February has been a dry month in East Anglia in recent years - possibly the driest month of all.

Well, if I've learned one thing already this year, it's that the disclaimer ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"" can be applied to many things, not just financial markets.

Moving the pig units to new fields has been challenging and exhausting. Our brilliant team, even though younger, have found the conditions punishing.

For an old man like me, the process cannot be over soon enough.

There will be rewards at the end of it though - a more compact layout using fields with good connectivity to each other and not randomly dotted across the estate. This will improve our travel time efficiency as we drive about.

An increased number of group-housed paddocks in each batch will mean we can have more control over sow sizing.

And the gilts on our smaller, 600-sow unit will be able to have designated paddocks of their own for the first time.

This will put a stop to adding the smallest parity-one sows in with them.

We haven't made any major changes, but I'm looking forward to seeing the fruits of the small tweaks we have made.

I'm also excited to experiment with an all-new insulated plastic farrowing ark. We have been assisting in the development of this all the way from the drawing board to the finished item.

It has the largest floor area and greatest cubic capacity of any farrowing ark I have ever used.

The insulation is better than ever, and when that's combined with an extra big auto vent and an exceptionally clever doorway design, it ticks all the boxes on my wish list.

Our plan was initially to invest in up to 30 new arks this year, but with the government's recent announcement of the 2024 Farming Equipment and Technology Fund, which offers grants of about half an item's cost, that number will hopefully be increased.

Grants are available for many things, including insulated farrowing arks, clean water tanks, ad-lib feeders, plastic hurdles, and even my new favourite thing from last year - shades.

I have a sneaking feeling my work is being watched.

Last year, the Brazilian music market had revenues of BRL 2.864 billion, up 13.4 percent from the previous year.

The data can be found in a report released Thursday (Mar. 21) by Pro-Música, the organization that represents Brazil's main record labels and producers. The result for last year more than triples the turnover of the domestic music market over the last six years.

Brazil has appeared in the ranking of the world's top ten music markets for seven consecutive years.

The growth in 2023 exceeds the expansion of the global market (10.2%), whose revenues reached $28.6 billion in the period, also influenced by streaming.

In an interview with Agência Brasil, Pro-Música President Paulo Rosa said the growth seen in Brazil is a fact to be celebrated and a sign that the country continues to be a vital market for music, especially Brazilian music.

The document points out that, among the 200 most streamed songs in Brazil in 2023, Brazilian music had a 93.5 percent share. ""This is much higher than it was in the days of vinyl and CDs. Brazilian music consumption usually accounted for around 75 percent. Today, it represents much more, at least among the most played songs. This is also something to celebrate. It showcases the great diversity of Brazilian music. It's not just the Rio-São Paulo axis -- the music produced in the big centers -- but music from all over Brazil and all over the world.""

He pointed out that Brazil does not lag so far behind the big markets, occupying ninth place in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) top ten ranking. ""We're in ninth place in the top 10, but still a long way off when compared to the US market, for example, which boasts over $15 billion, or the UK market [$3 billion], but we're fighting up there in the top 10.""

Paulo Rosa believes that Brazil, as the largest music market in Latin America, is a fairly accurate reflection of the region. ""I think there's still plenty of room for growth. If we look at the country's demographics, we feel there's still a great deal of room to continue expanding the number of subscribers of streaming platforms -- the dominant model today and the biggest boost to the market."" In his view, this is an extremely successful model in Latin America, due to its accessibility and reasonable price. This is also one of the reasons why streaming is growing so fast worldwide, both in Latin America and in Brazil, he argued.

Streaming accounted for 87.1 percent of total revenues in Brazil's recording market, up 14.6 percent from 2022, adding up to BRL 2.5 billion, maintaining streaming services as the number-one source of revenue for the sector. Subscription-based streaming on platforms such as Spotify, YouTube Music, Deezer, Apple Music, and others grew by 21.9 percent to BRL 1.6 billion. Streaming paid for by advertising grew by 7.3 percent with music videos and showed a slight drop of one percent in the audio segment.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,,0.2549019607843137,448936928,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b-181.jpeg,

The sector, known for its vibrant and often lighthearted approach to digital assets, has encountered backlash due to the emergence of memecoins with offensive themes.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has been rocked by the introduction of memecoins featuring derogatory names and symbols. The tokens that utilize racial slurs, anti-Semitic references, and extremist pictures have caused outrage all over.

Consequently, there has been an outcry. For instance, Camila Russo, a journalist, has voiced her concerns. Russo pointed to this worrying tendency of people buying these offensive tokens, stressing the necessity for centralized platforms to exercise their power and filter such content.

Likewise, Hayden Adams, the creator of Uniswap DEX, has argued for steps to blacklist these tokens from major platforms. The position is that as long as blockchain protocols are permissionless, front-end applications should not enable the propagation of hateful content. Such a stance was supported by DEX Screener, a DeFi analytic service, which has announced a change in its token moderation practices and said that it refuses to spread hatred.

With the recent upsurge in racism-related memecoins, the crypto community has come up with campaigns to support positive alternatives. A 'Stop Racism on Solana' memecoin stands out, having risen in value by roughly 19,000% in just 24 hours. This rally demonstrates the community's liking of tokens that carry positive messages and social causes.

Furthermore, the group of developers of the Floki memecoin has revealed groundbreaking projects for the integration of digital banking services with their product. These services seek to enable Floki token holders to transact in key fiat currencies and use banking services, specifically benefiting unbanked people. This activity adds value not only to the use of the Floki memecoin but also to the whole financial ecosystem.

The Floki memecoin project is making considerable progress in diversifying its utility beyond being just digital currency. The introduction of a decentralized website service, allowing users to host various online content using a "".floki"" domain, represents a pioneering move within the memecoin space. This latter stage tends to create new applications for Floki, thus disabling the project from the negative connotations associated with other memecoins.

In addition, the association with a fintech company that holds licenses in various jurisdictions to provide digital bank accounts and debit cards connected to Floki represents a significant move in the unification of cryptos with traditional financial services. Through this partnership, the usage of Floki becomes legitimized for daily transactions and reflects the potential of memecoins to play a substantial role in the global economy.

On Friday, Joe Flacco officially joined the Indianapolis Colts. While he is enthusiastic about this new opportunity, Flacco had anticipated staying with the Cleveland Browns after aiding them in securing a playoff berth last season.

During his introductory press conference with the Colts, Flacco admitted feeling ""a little surprised"" that Cleveland didn't retain him, as reported by The Athletic. The 39-year-old mentioned that unlike last year, he is pleased to join a team now rather than midseason. He also looks forward to collaborating with Colts' second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson.

""It's just about being in the room with him,"" Flacco stated. ""It's about bringing experience and helping him simplify things to play fast.""

Despite his brief stint in Cleveland, Flacco made a significant impact. The Browns recently conveyed their gratitude for Flacco's contributions, as he posted a 4-1 record as the team's starter in 2023.

Last season, Flacco was inactive until the Browns contacted him due to injuries affecting their quarterback roster. He was added to Cleveland's practice squad on Nov. 20 and rose to the starting lineup in Week 13. Flacco remained the starter for the rest of the season, playing a pivotal role in the Browns' playoff qualification.

""Joe, it was one helluva ride,"" the Browns expressed on X. ""You brought such a sense of joy and genuine excitement to this team game in and game out. We were proud to have you in the orange and brown, and we wish you nothing but the best in Indianapolis.""

Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar, who was part of the delegation, alleged that the Delhi model of liquor policy has also been implemented in Punjab.

Jakhar further claimed that the alleged liquor scam in Punjab is worth around thousands of crores.

""In Delhi, it is only about a loot of Rs 100 crores but here it's about thousands of crores. It is a matter of immense shame for the AAP who claims to be 'Kattar Imaandar' that 21 people have died from illicit liquor in the last 2 days and that too in the CM's constituency,"" said Jakhar.

The baseball world has adapted to a society that is technologically advancing at an unprecedented rate. Underlying baseball statistics, such as exit velocity, launch angle and more, are becoming increasingly valued, and teams can be seen as behind the curve if they don't utilize newer forms of technology.

Texas State ensures utilizes an optical ball tracking system called Yakkertech. Various collegiate, independent and MLB teams use this system, and it's more cost-effective compared to commonly used ball-tracking systems like Hawkeye and Trackman.

Yakkertech includes features that are beneficial to both pitchers and hitters. The Bobcats use the system to collect various forms of data such as spin rate, velocity, location and movement.

Texas State Head Coach Steven Trout welcomes technology and underlying statistics but doesn't want to put all his eggs in one basket, he said.

""I think it's important that there's information out there, but you can also have information overload,"" Trout said. ""We kind of tell ourselves that we're 50/50, new school/old school.""

Texas State redshirt senior catcher August Ramirez said he uses Yakkertech to get a feel for different strike zone tendencies by umpires and to improve his timing at the plate.

""Some of these umpires, their zones are different,"" Ramirez said. ""[Tracking velocity] as well... puts in perspective when to get going.""

While Yakkertech can be helpful for hitters trying to improve their approach at the plate, Trout said pitchers especially benefit from the ball-tracking system.

""You can use the technology to make your pitches that much better,"" Trout said. ""[It can] help develop pitches, help throw them in the right area [and] help with your sequencing or pitch dialogue.""

Redshirt senior pitcher Peyton Zabel views Yakkertech as a valuable tool to improve his performance on the mound, he said.

""It's a tool you use to get better in the offseason and kind of shape pitches and kind of find out what your strengths are as far as pitch profile and stuff like that,"" Zabel said. ""[It helps] figuring out what our strengths are and where we need to be pitching in the zone.""

Essentially, pitchers like Zabel use the technology provided by Yakkertech to polish their pitch selection and work on accurately hitting spots in the strike zone.

Technology and new age statistics are fundamental to the game of baseball in 2024, and whether someone is old school or new school, it can't be denied that the best programs utilize these tools to a certain extent.

""We use [technology and underlying statistics] in different stints,"" Trout said. ""But we don't use it all the time in every avenue.""",universitystar.com,news,The University Star,Jackson Kruse,0.1450980392156862,448936438,1,https://universitystar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/34957c90-e1bb-11ee-acc0-8ff272749682.jpg,

Government announcements on fiscal closing, domestic macroeconomic data, foreign capital inflow, and global cues are the main factors that will drive market movement.

Domestic equity benchmarks traded volatile - witnessing a roller-coaster move amid mixed cues last week before closing the week in positive territory by gaining nearly half a per cent. Initially, prices declined to a five-week low amid escalating concerns about froth building in the midcap and smallcap segments. The pressure on select heavyweights pushed the index lower in the middle.

Markets saw buoyancy on the global front triggered a rebound in the final sessions, which aided the index to close in the green. The indices rebounded as bargain hunters stepped in following the announcement from US Federal Reserve indicating a potential series of interest rate cuts throughout the year.

Nifty 50 and Sensex prices settled the week at 22,096.75 and 72,831.94 up 0.33 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. A mixed trend on the sectoral front kept the participants occupied wherein realty, auto and metal posted strong gains while IT and FMCG settled in the red. The broader indices also witnessed respite and gained around 1.5 per cent each.

''The IT sector faced headwinds driven by global slowdown in spending. Investors redirected attention towards the realty sector, which emerged as the top performer of the week. The bounce is expected to continue in the short-term as traders punt to buy when the market is trading at oversold territory. However, concerns persisted regarding inflated valuations in mid and small-cap stocks. Large caps are expected to outperform in the medium term,'' said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Week ahead, the primary market will be buzzing as several listings are slated across the small-and-medium enterprises (SME) segment. New new initial public offerings (IPO) across the mainboard and SME segments will open for subscription. The week will be crucial from domestic and technical point of view as fiscal closing will likely bring government announcements.

Overall, analysts expect volatility to remain high due to the scheduled expiry of March month derivatives contracts, and expect Nifty 50 to be in the range of 21,750-22,350 in the upcoming holiday-shortened week.

The truncated week includes market closures on both Monday for Holi and Friday for Good Friday, so analysts say that trading volumes may be lower with limited market cues. Experts also advice that traders should focus on stock selection and prefer index majors.

In the mainboard segment, SRM Contractors IPO will open for bidding on March 26. In the SME segment, Trust Fintech IPO, Vruddhi Engineering Works IPO, Blue Pebble IPO, Aspire & Innovative IPO, and GConnect Logitech IPO are opening for subscription on March 26.

On March 27, Radiowalla IPO, TAC Infosec IPO, and Yash Optics & Lens IPO are opening for subscription on March 27. Jay Kailash Namkeen IPO, K2 Infragen IPO, Aluwind Architectural IPO, and Creative Graphics Solutions India IPO are opening for subscription on March 28.

Among listings, shares of Chatha Foods will debut on BSE SME on March 27. On March 28, shares of Omfurn India will get listed on NSE SME.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in Indian markets last week and the net outflow stands at ₹83,65.53 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were buyers for all sessions, with a total investment of ₹19,351.62 crore, according to stock exchange data.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued their buying streak in March, turning steady buyers in Indian markets. Inflows rose in both debt and equities. The total debt investment stands at ₹13,223 crore so far this month.

FPIs have bought ₹38,098 crore worth of Indian equities and the total inflow stands at ₹51,542 crore as of March 22, taking into account debt, hybrid, debt-VRR, and equities, according to National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) data.

''The upcoming inclusion of Indian bonds in JP Morgan's index has lead to a inflow in advance into the Indian debt markets. Further the expected global tapering in policy rates should make bond yields in emerging economies look even more attractive to investors making this trend of inflows into Indian debt more sustainable,'' said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Julius Baer India.

Investors will be busy tracking the movement in US markets, bond markets and global macroeconomic data with the US GDP data and other key numbers are scheduled to be released in the next five days. The US Federal maintained its status quo on key interest rates last week but foresees three rate cuts in 2024.

Despite maintaining a forecast of lowering rates to 4.6 per cent by 2024, the latest ""dot plot"" indicates a shift in expectations, with fewer members anticipating multiple rate cuts this year. With signs of economic resilience and a willingness to tolerate temporary inflation fluctuations, the US central bank is fueling bullish sentiment in US markets, according to market experts.

''Policymakers intend to reduce interest rates three times this year, aligning with the quarterly forecasts from December...The US 10-year bond yield retreated from a nearly three-month high, reflecting increasing expectations of a reduction in the key benchmark rate,'' said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President, of Master Capital Services Ltd.

The S&P 500 ended near flat on Friday, but the index registered its biggest weekly percentage gain of 2024 after Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) stuck to its dovish stance and rate cut projections. The benchmark gauge notched its 20th record this year.

''Participants will continue to take cues from the global indices, especially the US markets, which are moving from strength to strength with every passing week. The major index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is set to test a new milestone of ""40,000"" and the support base has shifted to 39,200 in case of any profit taking,'' said Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking Ltd.

International crude oil prices traded lower in the previous session and settled flat on the week as discussions of a ceasefire in Gaza led by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a stronger US dollar resulted in selling pressure. Blinken believed that discussions in Qatar could lead to an agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Additionally, a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies, reducing the overall demand. The greenback traded higher to catch a second week of broad gains after the Swiss National Bank's unexpected interest rate cut last week.

Brent crude futures settled at $85.43, down 35 cents, while US crude settled at $80.63 a barrel, dropping 44 cents. Both oil benchmarks logged less a than one per cent change on the week, according to news agency Reuters.

In the upcoming week, shares of several companies will trade ex-dividend and ex-split despite two market holidays. Shares of CRISIL Ltd, SBI Cards and Payment Services, REC, among others will trade ex-dividend in the coming week, starting from Tuesday, March 26. Persistent Systems will declare a stock split, among others. Check full list here

Technically, Nifty attempted to build support around 21,700. However, the immediate hurdle lies at the 20-DMA of 22,170, according to Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. A sustained break above this level could trigger short covering, pushing the index towards 22,300 and even 22,440.

''The recent rebound in the Nifty can be largely attributed to the favorable global cues however it is still facing a hurdle around the short term moving average i.e. 20 DEMA. We reiterate our cautious view on Nifty until it decisively reclaims the 22,200 zone otherwise profit taking may resume. On the downside, 21,500- 21,800 would continue to offer a cushion,'' said Religare Brokings' Ajit Mishra.

''Since we are seeing mixed trends across sectors, participants should focus on stock selection and risk management. We reiterate our preference for index majors &amp; large midcaps and suggest utilizing rebound in the smallcap space to reduce positions,'' added Mishra.

Bank Nifty held above its key 100-DMA, but faces an immediate challenge at the psychological level of 47,000, which also coincides with its 20-DMA. ''A break above this level could trigger short covering and a rally towards the 47,800-48,000 zone. The 46,400-46,000 zone acts as initial support. If the index falls below this, the next potential support lies at the 200-DMA around 45,400,'' added Santosh Meena.

Despite Africa boasting an impressive economy valued at US$ 3.1 tril­lion, Pakistan's engage­ment with the continent has historically been marred by neglect, resulting in the failure to exploit the vast economic oppor­tunities the region offered. How­ever, in recent years, Pakistan has become fully cognisant of the geo-strategic and geo-economic impor­tance of Africa. Therefore, in 2019, Pakistan launched its Engage Afri­ca Policy, aimed at strengthening diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with African countries.

The policy started bearing fruit soon after its inception. It played a significant role in strengthen­ing commercial ties between Pak­istan and Africa. For example, de­spite stagnant trade figures in the previous years, the trade volume between the two sides surged to US$ 6.94 billion in 2022. This in­crease can be attributed to policy initiatives, such as the Pakistan-Africa Trade Development Confer­ences (PATDC) and Single Country Exhibitions (SCE). These events served as platforms for fostering dialogue, networking, and explor­ing trade opportunities, resulting in tangible outcomes.

Furthermore, under the policy, trade wings in six African countries have been established, including Algeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Tan­zania, to promote trade and devel­opment. Similarly, Pakistan's par­ticipation in international trade fairs has opened up new avenues for trade and economic coopera­tion. For example, participation in Khartoum in January 2021 resulted in business transactions amounting to approximately $2 million, with deals worth $3 million between Pakistani exporters and Sudanese buyers currently on the cards.

While Pakistan's Engage Africa Policy can be deemed as a step in the right direction, there exist sev­eral deficiencies in the foreign pol­icy arena that require urgent atten­tion. While Pakistan's trade volume with Africa has reached its histori­cal milestone, the trade balance has been heavily tilted in favour of the latter since 2015. This can be attrib­uted to a number of reasons. First, Pakistan faces anti-dumping duties on exports to several African coun­tries. While these duties are levied to protect domestic industries from unfair international competition, it has generated challenges for Paki­stani exporters by limiting their ac­cess to certain markets and restrict­ing their ability to diversify their consumer base. In a prominent case, the imposition of anti-dump­ing duties on Pakistan's exports to South Africa, varying from 14 per­cent to 77 percent, resulted in con­siderable a loss of US$ 67.8 million in its Portland cement exports.

Second, tariff discrepancies have hindered Pakistan's export com­petitiveness in African markets. For example, While Pakistan faces an average tariff of 11 percent on its tea imports from Kenya, its pri­mary export to Kenya encounters a much higher average tariff rate of 35 percent. Such a situation affects Pakistan's market share in Afri­can markets, allowing competitors with lower tariff burdens to gain a larger share of the market.

Third, the ongoing urbanisation trend in Africa, along with the bur­geoning potential of African mar­kets, has sparked international competition, with states, such as the United States, China and In­dia vying for market dominance in the region. This has made it chal­lenging for Pakistan to make its in­roads into the African market and establishing its niche.

Pakistan must rectify these imbal­ances and generate a level playing for itself. To begin, Pakistan needs to leverage its prevailing strengths to tap into African markets. For ex­ample, the African region grapples with significant health crises char­acterised by prevalent diseases, such as malaria, typhoid, dengue fever, etc. A situation like this pres­ents an opportunity for Pakistan's pharmaceutical sector to collabo­rate with pertinent stakeholders in Africa to address these issues. This also aligns with the current goal of Pakistan's government to signifi­cantly expand its pharmaceutical exports to US$ 5 billion.

Next, fostering balanced com­mercial ties with African markets requires robust marketing strate­gies, incorporating comprehensive mechanisms aimed at leveraging Duty-Free Agreements across the region. In this regard, business and governments can closely collaborate with foreign missions and diplomat­ic channels to negotiate favourable trade terms. Moreover, marketing strategies must be tailored to lo­cal preferences and cultural nuanc­es. For instance, in the textile sector, Pakistan can adapt fabric preferenc­es, colours, and designs according to the tropical climate of Africa.

Additionally, Pakistan's engage­ment with Africa can be further strengthened through cross-cultur­al diplomacy. Cricket diplomacy can play a significant role here. Not only it will boost cross-cultural inter­connectedness, but it will also open avenues for the promotion of Pak­istani products in African markets.

All in all, Pakistan's Engage Africa Policy is an ambitious undertaking by Pakistan with the indispensable goal of generating a strategic part­nership based on mutual respect and prosperity. By embracing the di­verse opportunities Africa presents, Pakistan can contribute meaning­fully to regional stability, economic prosperity, and global cooperation, ultimately paving the way for a more prosperous future for both regions.

Memecoins have become a point of controversy within the cryptocurrency community. The sector, known for its vibrant and often lighthearted approach to digital assets, has encountered backlash due to the emergence of memecoins with offensive themes.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has been rocked by the introduction of memecoins featuring derogatory names and symbols. The tokens that utilize racial slurs, anti-Semitic references, and extremist pictures have caused outrage all over.

Consequently, there has been an outcry. For instance, Camila Russo, a journalist, has voiced her concerns. Russo pointed to this worrying tendency of people buying these offensive tokens, stressing the necessity for centralized platforms to exercise their power and filter such content.

Likewise, Hayden Adams, the creator of Uniswap DEX, has argued for steps to blacklist these tokens from major platforms. The position is that as long as blockchain protocols are permissionless, front-end applications should not enable the propagation of hateful content. Such a stance was supported by DEX Screener, a DeFi analytic service, which has announced a change in its token moderation practices and said that it refuses to spread hatred.

With the recent upsurge in racism-related memecoins, the crypto community has come up with campaigns to support positive alternatives. A 'Stop Racism on Solana' memecoin stands out, having risen in value by roughly 19,000% in just 24 hours. This rally demonstrates the community's liking of tokens that carry positive messages and social causes.

Furthermore, the group of developers of the Floki memecoin has revealed groundbreaking projects for the integration of digital banking services with their product. These services seek to enable Floki token holders to transact in key fiat currencies and use banking services, specifically benefiting unbanked people. This activity adds value not only to the use of the Floki memecoin but also to the whole financial ecosystem.

The Floki memecoin project is making considerable progress in diversifying its utility beyond being just digital currency. The introduction of a decentralized website service, allowing users to host various online content using a "".floki"" domain, represents a pioneering move within the memecoin space. This latter stage tends to create new applications for Floki, thus disabling the project from the negative connotations associated with other memecoins.

In addition, the association with a fintech company that holds licenses in various jurisdictions to provide digital bank accounts and debit cards connected to Floki represents a significant move in the unification of cryptos with traditional financial services. Through this partnership, the usage of Floki becomes legitimized for daily transactions and reflects the potential of memecoins to play a substantial role in the global economy.",coingape.com,news,Coingape,Kelvin Munene Murithi,-0.2,448935620,1,https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Memecoins.jpg,

While BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh demanded an investigation by CBI, a Punjab BJP delegation led by state chief Sunil Jakhar approached Punjab chief electoral officer (CEO) Sibin C to demand a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into ""planned corruption"" in Punjab excise policy.

In its memorandum, the BJP delegation submitted that the policy in Punjab was on the lines of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. The delegation said with ED arresting Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal for his role in 'orchestrating massive corruption' through Delhi excise policy, Election Commission should order a detailed investigation by ED to unearth ""mountain of corruption sponsored and patented by Bhagwant Mann dispensation"".

Chugh called the tragedy the fallout of a liquor scam in Punjab under the patronage of AAP govt. Demanding a CBI probe, Chugh said CM Bhagwant Mann-led govt had been playing with the lives of people with its liquor policy, which he called lopsided. Chugh also demanded compensation for families of the people who fell prey to the tragedy and said officers concerned should be held accountable.

The delegation submitted that Bhagwant Mann-led govt acted at the behest of political leaders in Delhi and there was an apprehension that Punjab had lost at least Rs 1,000 crore in revenue due to this favouritism and illegality perpetrated through Punjab excise policy.",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,,-0.3411764705882353,448935615,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-9419075

Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh likened his party to a ""well-established company"" whose market capitalisation keeps fluctuating and asserted that it will stage a comeback.

In an interaction at the PTI office here, Ramesh also dismissed suggestions that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charisma that was responsible for the BJP's electoral performance and stressed on the importance of organisational strength.

The idea of a charismatic leader was a ""dangerous concept"" to believe in as one doing so, automatically believes in a ""demagogue"", the Congress general secretary in charge communications asserted.

Talking about the need for bringing in new faces, Ramesh, however, noted that this was difficult in the Congress because people have been in the party for long.

""It's easier for the BJP. Because, you know, the BJP is a startup in many states. You look upon the BJP as a startup. The Congress is not a startup. The Congress is a well-established company whose market cap (market capitalization) keeps fluctuating. But the BJP is a startup,"" he said.

""So, a startup can absorb a lot of people. The guy who does not get a ticket in the Congress joins the BJP. So in many of the states, I would say, the Congress' disadvantage is that it has been entrenched for decades,"" he said during an interaction with editors and journalists of the news agency on Friday.

One of the disadvantages of being entrenched is that one is not able to give opportunities to new people to come in, Ramesh noted.

Asked about the central leadership, he said the Congress is the only party to have an elected president.

""We tend to ascribe far too much importance to individuals... If you read the bible of Indian political science by Rajni Kothari, one of the points Rajni Kothari makes in that book is that there was a Congress system and that system first got broken in 1969 with the first split and then it got broken in 1978 with the second split,"" Ramesh said.

He said, ""You can have all the charismatic leadership on the top, but if at the district level, at the block level and at the state level you don't have these systems of mediation, of conflict management and of bringing people into the fold, then no individual is going to make a difference.""

""Today, we had the opportunity to make the case to the Tenth Circuit that Oklahoma's decision to strip transgender people of the long-standing ability to obtain birth certificates that match their gender identity is unconstitutional discrimination and a violation of their right to privacy,"" said Lambda Legal Senior Counsel Peter Renn. ""Accurate identity documents are basic tools that are essential to everyone's ability to navigate modern life. Oklahoma's ban is not only discriminatory, but it also exposes transgender people to harassment, abuse, and physical danger. We urged the court to reverse the decision upholding this regressive policy, which is connected to a larger national effort seeking to erase the legal existence of transgender people.""

On November 8, 2021, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt issued an executive order that overturned the long-standing practice of the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) to allow transgender people to correct their birth certificates to match their gender identity. This practice had been in place for at least 14 years, from 1997 to 2021. Governor Stitt justified this reversal, stating, ""I believe that people are created by God to be male or female. Period,"" and vowing to take ""whatever action necessary to protect Oklahoma values and our way of life."" Previously, transgender people could correct their birth certificates by presenting a court order to OSDH, but following the executive order, OSDH has refused to comply with such orders.

Lambda Legal and Tulsa attorney Karen Keith Wilkins filed Fowler v. Stitt in March 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on behalf of a transgender woman, Rowan Fowler, and two transgender men.

The U.S. District Court dismissed the complaint in June 2023, and Lambda Legal appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit.

Before firefighters arrived, Moline Police officers reported that a section of the food distribution center was completely engulfed.

The first fire company arrived and launched an aggressive attack on the blaze that resulted in the fire being extinguished in about 50 minutes.

Regenwether said two people were inside the structure when the fire started, but they were able to escape the building unharmed.

The European Committee of the Regions (CoR), together with the founding partners of the EU-wide coalition #CohesionAlliance, launched a joint call to the European institutions and national governments to keep Cohesion Policy as the main pillar of the EU's development model in the next decade.

Recent farmers' protests are the most visible sign of a rising discontent against EU's green and economic policies that could increase poverty and social exclusion across the continent, notably in rural areas. During the plenary debate that animated the first day of the 10th European Summit of Regions and Cities in Mons (Belgium), national ministers, European Commissioners, representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU, together with regional governors and mayors, agreed on the imperative need for Europe to achieve a green transition that is fair for all citizens and industrial sectors. Economic, social and territorial cohesion should be at the top of the EU agenda, continue to boost digital and environmental transitions, and improve resilience to disasters and crises at all levels.

As outlined also by the former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, the Single Market can only be successful thanks to a strong Cohesion Policy supporting all regions. Mr Letta, who is currently President of the Jacques Delors Institute, was tasked by EU institutions to write a report on the future of the Single Market, to be published in the coming weeks.

During the debate, the President of the CoR, Vasco Alves Cordeiro, launched the #CohesionAlliance joint call on EU institutions and national governments for a ""renewed Cohesion Policy post-2027 that leaves no one behind"". The call states the principles on which the future EU regional policy should be based in order to remain a fundamental pillar of the EU development model and the core long-term, decentralised investment policy of the future EU budget.

Quotes:

Vasco Alves Cordeiro, President of the European Committee of the Regions, said: ""We now stand at a crossroads: as Europeans cast their vote, it is up to us that Europe answers with solidarity and progress. This is why, more than ever, we need to speak beyond those who are already convinced that Cohesion Policy is the solution to ensure that no people and no places are left behind in the wake of the green and digital transitions.""

Elisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, said: ""Cohesion Policy's crucial role in keeping Europe together was once again highlighted at this important Summit. In light of the unprecedented challenges the EU is facing, our common European house will only thrive if no place or person feels left behind, if we are able to harness everyone's talent in delivering on our ambitions. Cohesion Policy is now more necessary than ever!"".

Nicolas Schmit, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: ""The green and digital transitions have to work for everyone, or they will not work at all. Cohesion Policy is a powerful tool to help those most affected face the challenges the transitions bring, and to help all regions reap the benefits. The EU must keep fairness and inclusion at the heart of its policies going forward. Europe is its cities and regions"".

Enrico Letta, President of the Jacques Delors Institute and former Prime Minister of Italy, who was tasked by EU institutions to write a report on the future of the Single Market, said: ""The Single Market is made up of towns, territories and citizens, each with their own specific characteristics. As Jacques Delors has always advocated, the completion of the Single Market must be accompanied by cohesion policies that enable everyone to seize its opportunities.""

Background:

Among the speakers of the debate entitled ""Just transition and cohesion at the heart of future EU investment policies"", there were Vasco Alves Cordeiro, CoR President, Elio Di Rupo, Minister-President of the Wallonia Region and CoR Member, Pierre-Yves Dermagne, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy and Employment, Elisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Nicolas Schmit, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Dominique Faure, French Minister Delegate for Local Authorities and Rural Affairs, Enrico Letta, President of the Jacques Delors Institute (remotely), Emil Boc, Mayor of Cluj-Napoca (RO) and Chair of the CoR commission for territorial cohesion policy and EU budget, and Oliver Paasch, Minister-President of the German-speaking Community of Belgium.

The debate took place during the 10 European Summit of Regions and Cities, which is bringing in Mons (Belgium), thousands of regional governors, mayors, and local councillors together with members of the European Parliament, representatives of national governments, the European Commission and the civil society to address some of the pressing challenges that local communities in the EU will face over the next years.

Companies are seeking to make their products more robust to survive the rigours of shipping, with some saying they have already seen results, in the form of fewer returns.

ITC, for instance, changed the cap of shower gels to prevent leakage even when there is no scotch tape. This is one among changes in the packaging design for most of its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Parle Products is adding protective layers for its '30-80 biscuit packs, which mostly sell online. It has also introduced a separate outer packing for bundled biscuit packs to be sold online, to ensure they are not broken.

Goods sold online change hands more times than offline, often being roughly handled by delivery personnel, company executives said, adding that the chances of leaks or transit damage increase while shipping individual units.

ITC personal care products business chief executive Sameer Satpathy said ecommerce-friendly packaging provides a relative advantage since consumers want full value from their purchases. A damaged or leaked product fosters discontent.

Parle vice-president Mayank Shah pointed to the increasing sales via quick commerce of FMCG. Most FMCG companies have been reporting an improvement in ecommerce's share of total sales since the pandemic.

This is led by a change in shopping behaviour and the rise of quick commerce in large cities.

Researcher NielsenIQ shows online contribution for impulse food such as chocolates, confectioneries and salty snacks rose to 5% in 2023, from 3% in 2022. In case of products such as washing powders/liquids, pre-post wash products, detergents and bleaches, online contribution climbed from 6% to 7% year-on-year. r. For utensil, toilet, floor and glass cleaning fluids, online sales grew from 10% of total sales to 11% in the period under review.

Little wonder then that an FMCG major even discussed packaging in a recent management committee meeting after a few executives complained of receiving damaged products when purchased online. Dabur, targeting younger consumers buying online, has started to redesign packs for online sales. Chief executive Mohit Malhotra said it is launching ""aspirational packaging"" that is more consumer-friendly ergonomically -- making it easier to hold and use.

Health food brand Bagrry's has shifted mid-sized packages for cereals from cardboard boxes to pouches and jars, while adding corrugated boxes for its plant-based beverages to reduce transit damage. The company has also designed a 1.5-kg corrugated box pack of muesli in collaboration with Amazon, so the latter does not require to add a protective layer of additional packaging. ""The returns due to shipping damage have drastically come down due to these packaging changes,"" said Bagrry's India director Aditya Bagri.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.09019607843137245,448935165,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108738591,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-74700,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",

""It gives families exposure to a range of different sports so they can see what their children might be interested in before they commit to something outside of kinder.

""It definitely helps with the language and social skills they will need for school, especially learning to take turns, and it's been good to have access to different equipment and resources.""

Anthony Costa Foundation general manager Cynthia Scherer said she was pleased to support the program through the foundation's small grants round earlier this year.

""The evidence-based program uses movement and sport as a vehicle to improve the overall well-being of children,"" she said.

""We understand the importance of ensuring young children are on track as it relates to their physical health, well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language, and communication skills.""",geelongindy.com.au,news,Geelong Independent,Jin Hui,0.6392156862745098,448934868,1,https://geelongindy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Movers_396427_01.jpg,

Private employment increased 83,000 jobs but was swamped by the ending of many temporary government jobs associated with the decennial census.

This is a weak labor market report, with the health of the labor market not improving even as the slow recovery continues. Job growth and wages in the private sector are still anemic, especially compared to government workers who have not experienced nearly the same amount of job losses. The American experiment in Keynesianism has not fared well.

The June Report

While total employment fell by 125,000 jobs, the reason is not quite as alarming as the number. Government jobs fell by 208,000, almost all of them associated with the census. Private hiring increased in many industries, including manufacturing (9,000) and the service sector (91,000). The construction industry again shed jobs (-22,000) as both the private and commercial real estate market continue to struggle.

While the unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 to 9.5 percent, this is due to a large drop (-652,000) in the labor force, which decreased from 65 to 64.7 percent. A large drop in working teenagers accounted for almost 40 percent of the decline in labor force. Women over 20 accounted for another 41 percent, while adult men were less than one-fifth of the labor force decline.

The number of teens in the civilian labor force has reached its lowest level since the 1960s. The large decline in potential adult working women dropped the female labor force to its lowest level this year, erasing the labor force growth for the rest of 2010.

A larger concern is that the number of hours and wages did not increase in the last month. In fact, the average hourly earnings for all private workers actually declined by two cents. This indicates that the labor market is not recovering as fast as it was earlier in the spring. Businesses are not hiring or expanding their work hours as much. Even temporary help hiring (20,500) has slowed significantly, growing at the lowest rate since last September.

More Government Does Not Reduce Unemployment

Congress and the Administration have attempted to boost employment through government spending. Figure 1 shows the Administration's unemployment if Congress did and did not pass the stimulus, as well as the actual unemployment rate since then. By the President's own measure, the stimulus has failed.

This is unsurprising. Government spending does little to boost private sector hiring, for two reasons. First, government spending does not encourage new private investment. For example, government highway construction, while funding construction jobs, does not address the underlying factors that discourage entrepreneurs from staring new firms.

Second, the resources the government spends do not materialize out of thin air -- they are taken from the private sector. Each dollar the government borrows is one dollar less that entrepreneurs can borrow to fund new operations or that private consumers can spend. Research shows that government spending crowds out private investment. Each $1 increase in government spending reduces private sector investment by between $0.46 and $0.97 after two years and $0.74 and $0.95 over five years.[1]

Government spending substitutes for private sector investment; it does not supplement it. This is why countries in which the government spends heavily to create jobs -- such as France and Germany -- do not enjoy higher employment rates. In fact, countries with greater government spending and larger public sector payrolls have higher unemployment.[2]

Government Spending Does Benefit Government Workers

Greater government spending does benefit one group of workers: government employees. The stimulus increased federal spending and directed billions to state governments. As a result, government employment has stayed steady even as private sector employment has plunged.

Since the start of the recession in December 2007, private sector employment has fallen by 7.9 million jobs (6.8 percent), federal government employment has increased by 240,000 jobs (12.2 percent), and state and local employment has dropped by just 60,000 jobs (0.3 percent).

As a result, government workers enjoy the lowest unemployment rates of workers in any industry. Figure 2 shows unemployment rates by industry in June 2010. Across all industries, private sector workers endure an average unemployment rate of 9.7 percent. Unemployment for government employees is less than half that rate at 4.4 percent.

Government employees have enjoyed a privileged position in this recession, largely insulated from the effects of the downturn.

No Bailout for Government Workers

As the recession continues to affect tax revenues, many states are now proposing budget cutbacks. These cutbacks would mean layoffs of some state and local government employees, primarily teachers. To prevent this, the House of Representatives has added a $10 billion bailout for state and local government education budgets.

Such a bailout would prevent state and local governments from having to prioritize spending and layoff redundant employees. It would help insulate government employees from the uncertainty of the recession and add billions to the national debt. It would not, however, boost the economy. If government spending and job security for government employees helped the economy, then Greece would be booming right now.

The state government bailout is a special interest handout that boosts the job security of a politically favored group -- government employees -- at a cost to America's future fiscal health and taxpayers' wallets.

Businesses Hunkering Down

The June jobs report illustrates that the recovery in the labor market has slowed. The labor market remains weak and job growth is elusive. Businesses are saving their cash as they worry about looming tax increases, government regulations, and below-average economic growth. Congress should resist efforts to pass another weak stimulus bill that would transfer resources from the private to the public sector. Instead, Congress should look to encourage private business development and formation through tax cuts and fewer regulations.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Rea Hederman,-0.06666666666666665,448934794,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,

The Monetary Policy Committee decided at its monthly meeting to keep the key Bank Rate at 0.1% and the size of its quantitative easing programme at GBP895 billion.

The central bank said it expects UK gross domestic product to shrink by about 4% in the first quarter of 2021, reversing its expectations back in November for a growing economy at the start of the new year.

The pound was quoted at USD1.3611 at midday Thursday, down from USD1.3651 at the London equities close Wednesday, in the wake of the BoE decision.

The FTSE 100 index was down 22.64 points, or 0.4%, at 6,485.13. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 2.02 points at 20,750.43. The AIM All-Share index was up 0.1% at 1,199.97.

The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.1% at 645.35. The Cboe 250 was down 0.1% at 18,265.31 and the Cboe Small Companies was flat at 12,365.54.

In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.4% while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.5%.

There will be a press conference with BoE Governor Andrew Bailey at 1300 GMT, and investors will be looking to see whether policymakers are closer to embracing the idea of using negative interest rates for the first time ever to try to stimulate an economy battered by the effects of Covid-19.

In its midday statement, the UK central bank said it is appropriate to start preparations for negative rates, if needed in the future, but it stressed that a negative Bank Rate is not imminent.

Among individual London stocks at midday, Compass Group was up 3.9% in the FTSE 100, after the contract caterer reported a more moderate decline in organic revenue for its first quarter and improved margins, the contract caterer having been hit hard by the virus pandemic and associated restrictions on travel and entertainment.

Organic revenue tumbled 34% year-on-year in the three months to December 31, which is the first quarter of Compass's 2021 financial year.

This marked an improvement on a 34% slide in the fourth quarter of its 2020 financial year and a 44% tumble in the third quarter. Compass's financial year runs to September 30.

Barratt Developments was up 2.3% after the UK housebuilder reported positive interim results and resumed dividend payments.

For the half year ended December 31, revenue rose 10% to GBP2.49 billion from GBP2.27 billion at the same time in 2019 and pretax profit was up 1.7% at GBP430.2 from GBP423 million.

Barratt declared an interim dividend of 7.5 pence against none in the prior year.

IG Group's Chris Beauchamp said: ""In London, housebuilders have been given a lift by Barratt Developments, which has declared its intention to resume dividend payments after a solid first half â€"" with the UK vaccinating at an increasingly fast pace a return to normality this year still looks possible, and this points towards a much more robust outlook for the market as buying and selling activity picks up too.

""Compass Group shares continued their rebound from the lows at the end of January, and while revenues remained under pressure in the first quarter of the year operating margins have picked up, while cost-cutting has meant all regions are now profitable once again. 2020 marked a rude interruption to the steady ascent of its shares, but the situation appears to have stabilised, and the outlook now seems much more promising.""

Housebuilding peers Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey were up 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.

At the other end of the large caps, Unilever was the worst performer, down 4.0%. The consumer goods firm posted an annual earnings fall, with revenue falling short of expectations, hurt by currency movements in its fourth-quarter.

For 2020, Unilever posted revenue of EUR50.72 billion, down 2.4% from USD51.98 billion in 2019. Revenue just missed forecasts of EUR50.81 billion. On a constant currency basis, however, revenue was up 3.5% in 2020.

Annual pretax profit fell 3.5% to EUR8.00 billion from EUR8.29 billion, though like revenue, it rose at constant currency, by 3.9%.

For the whole of 2020, underlying sales growth was 1.9%, in line with expectations.

Looking ahead, Unilever said it will aim for underlying sales growth ahead of its markets, delivering growth in the range of 3% to 5%, as well as profit growth ahead of sales growth.

Royal Dutch Shell's A and B shares were down 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively, after the oil major joined peer BP in swinging to a hefty annual loss.

Brent oil was quoted at USD58.86 a barrel Thursday midday, up from USD58.64 at the London equities close Wednesday.

For 2020, Shell swung to a loss attributable to shareholders of USD21.68 billion from a profit of USD15.84 billion in 2019. Adjusted earnings were USD4.84 billion, down 71% from USD16.46 billion - missing consensus forecasts for USD5.05 billion.

For the fourth quarter alone, Shell swung to a loss attributable to shareholders of USD4.01 billion from a USD965 million profit in 2019.

Free cash flow for 2020 was USD17.63 billion, down 12% from USD20.1 billion in 2019. Net debt increased by USD1.9 billion to USD75.4 billion in the fourth quarter, hurt by lower free cash flow, including a small working capital outflow.

Shell slashed its fourth quarter payout 65% to USD0.1665 from USD0.47. Its annual dividend was down 65% to USD0.6530. However, Shell expects that the first quarter dividend will be USD0.1735.

""Whichever way you look at it these numbers are disappointing, lower production volumes, reduced cash flow and a rise in net debt, and while CEO Ben van Buerden may point to a 'extraordinary year' pointing to implementing tough but decisive actions, the reality is thereâ€™s not a lot to cheer in these numbers,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

On the economic front, the UK construction sector activity fell into contraction territory in January as concerns about the near-term economic outlook led to greater hesitancy among clients, IHS Markit said.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers' index registered 49.2 points in January, down from 54.6 in December. The latest reading missed the market forecast, cited by FXStreet, of 52.9. Any reading below 50.0 points indicates contraction, while one above signals expansion.

Markit said the latest survey showed a slowdown in new order growth to its weakest since June 2020.

The euro stood at USD1.1991 at midday, down from USD1.2022 late Wednesday after disappointing economic data from the continent.

Eurozone construction activity in January contracted at steepest rate since May 2020, figures from IHS Markit showed.

The IHS Markit eurozone construction total activity index fell to 44.1 points in January from 45.5 in December, to signal a sharp and accelerated decline in eurozone construction activity.

Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY105.30, higher from JPY105.05.

US stock market futures were pointing higher ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from tobacco firm Philip Morris International and carmaker Ford.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.1%, the S&P 500 up 0.2% and Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%.

Saturday's game featured 10 ties and 15 lead changes. UCSD led by four points just 3 1/2 minutes into the game, but was unable to pull decisively ahead. Chicago State got 26 points from the combination of Cardet and Jahseasn Corbett in the first half, and the Cougars and Tritons entered the break tied at 38.

Chicago State came out hot in the second half, outscoring UCSD 15-6 in the first four-plus minutes. UCSD battled back, holding Chicago State scoreless or more than 5 minutes. With 8:52 remaining, Francis Nwaokorie nailed a free throw to tie the game at 55. Emmanuel Tshimanga's bucket a minute later made it 57-55 in favor of UCSD.

Chicago State got a pair of 3-pointers from Corbett to re-take the lead late. Pope attempted a 3-pointer at the buzzer that would've given the Tritons the win, but it fell short.

In other words, what kind of financial shape you are in overall.

If you are in good financial health, you are thriving financially. It is a comprehensive measure that includes understanding how well you are managing your economic life.

Good financial health is not simply a question of having wealth; it is about managing and utilizing the money you have efficiently and wisely. It measures your ability to withstand or handle financial stressors and reach your short-, medium-, and long-term financial goals.

The Corporate Financial Institute says the following about the term ""financial health"":

""Financial health is a basic measure of the soundness of an individual's finances - essentially, it's about what kind of financial shape you're in overall. You may also view it as a reflection of your level of financial security.""

Essentially, financial health is about balance. It encompasses your income, expenses, debt, savings, and investments. It is also about having financial literacy, that is, understanding how money works in your life, being capable of making informed and effective decisions with all of your financial resources.

If you have good financial health, you manage these elements to ensure that you are spending within your means, that is, not spending more than you earn. You can handle unforeseen expenses, are not overburdened by debt, and are saving for future needs.

If your income exceeds your expenses, you have a positive cash flow. Positive cash flow is a primary indicator of financial health.

With your surplus, you can save or invest. People who are healthy financially have a cushion to protect them against unexpected events, such as job loss, medical emergencies, and major home repairs.

Most of us have to borrow money, it is often unavoidable. Managing debt properly is a crucial part of financial health. Apart of keeping debt levels manageable, you must also understand the cost of borrowing and prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debts.

An emergency fund is a dedicated amount of money that is easily accessible for emergencies. If a financial surprise emerges, you can cover the costs without needing to incur debt.

Saving wisely means regularly setting aside money for future goals such as retirement. Investing means getting your money to work for you - growing your wealth over time. Financially healthy people strive to build up their savings and investments.

Financial health means knowing about and understanding your financial situation. You should be regularly checking your account balances and tracking your spending. You should also know what your credit score is and what can boost and harm it.

Do you set short- and long-term financial goals and create a plan to achieve them? People who enjoy financial health are proactive in managing their financial future.

We can also use the term to describe the state of finances of a company. When applied to businesses, it involves examining key factors such as liquidity, solvency, profitability, operational efficiency, and capacity for growth.

For countries, financial health is assessed through such indicators as GDP growth rates, national debt levels, credit rating, fiscal policies, unemployment rates, and the ability to finance operations and meet obligations.",marketbusinessnews.com,news,Market Business News,,0.1294117647058823,448934160,1,https://marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Financial-Health-Thumbnail-Image.jpg,

With 60% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

So it follows, every decision made by insiders of Ainsworth Game Technology regarding the company's future would be crucial to them.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Ainsworth Game Technology, beginning with the chart below.

See our latest analysis for Ainsworth Game Technology

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ainsworth Game Technology?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Ainsworth Game Technology does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ainsworth Game Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Ainsworth Game Technology is not owned by hedge funds. Johann Graf is currently the largest shareholder, with 53% of shares outstanding. This essentially means that they have extensive influence, if not outright control, over the future of the corporation. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 4.5% of the stock.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.

Insider Ownership Of Ainsworth Game Technology

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that insiders own more than half of Ainsworth Game Technology Limited. This gives them effective control of the company. Given it has a market cap of AU$426m, that means they have AU$254m worth of shares. Most would argue this is a positive, showing strong alignment with shareholders. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Ainsworth Game Technology. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Private Company Ownership

It seems that Private Companies own 7.2%, of the Ainsworth Game Technology stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

Amidst a backdrop of economic optimism and reassurance from the Federal Reserve, investors are expanding their focus beyond the tech giants that have traditionally dominated the US stock market.

While stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms have driven significant gains in 2024, sectors such as financials, industrials, and energy are also flourishing, contributing to the S&P 500's robust 9.7% year-to-date increase.

This diversification reflects a departure from concerns about the market's reliance on a handful of stocks. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by expectations of continued economic resilience and fading inflationary pressures.

The Federal Reserve's recent statements, indicating confidence in managing inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts, have further bolstered this outlook.

Scott Chronert of Citi noted that investors now feel more comfortable exploring opportunities beyond the tech sector, particularly in areas like banking and industry, anticipating potential rate cuts by the Fed.

Looking ahead, investors are keenly awaiting updates on inflation trends, with the personal consumption expenditures price index due for release. Additionally, the end of the first quarter may bring about portfolio adjustments among fund managers, potentially leading to increased market volatility.

The current market landscape contrasts with the previous year, marked by uncertainty that propelled investors towards the tech giants, collectively known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" However, in 2024, sectors like finance and industry have outperformed, with energy also experiencing notable gains.

Despite this shift, the Magnificent Seven continues to wield considerable influence, responsible for 40% of the S&P 500's gains thus far.

While enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has propelled stocks like Nvidia, others in the tech sector, like Apple and Tesla, have faced challenges.

Apple recently encountered regulatory scrutiny, adding to concerns surrounding Big Tech. Broader market indicators, such as a greater number of S&P 500 stocks outperforming the benchmark, signal a more diversified and resilient market landscape.

Some investors anticipate further expansion, particularly in sectors like small caps, fueled by the Fed's accommodative stance. However, risks remain with potential economic fluctuations posing a threat to the market's Goldilocks narrative.

At present, crude oil, which is the raw material for producing fuels like petrol and diesel, is not allowed to be exported except through the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

In an order, the ministry said the condition of export being allowed only through IOC will continue, but ""AMI (Adnoc Marketing International (India) RSC Limited India) is exempted from STE conditions and is allowed to re-export crude oil from their commercial stockpile at Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve, at their own cost"".

India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 85 per cent of its oil needs and has built strategic storages at three locations to store up to 5.33 million tonnes of oil as insurance against any supply disruption.

The storage at Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes), and Padur (2.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka can meet about 9 days of national demand.

The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd has leased half of the 1.5 million tonne capacity in Mangalore storage to Adnoc. The remaining was retained by ISPRL.

The idea behind leasing the storage to foreign companies was that they could store oil for sale to domestic refiners. But in case of an emergency, India held the first right on oil usage.

Adnoc had sought permission for the export of its oil from the cavern in cases where it could not find buyers in Indian refiners.

This was urged by experts during a webinar titled ""Renewable Energy: Pursuing Clean Energy Solutions for Pakistan"", organised by Global Neighbourhood for Media Innovation in collaboration with the United States Department of State.

The online moot discussed the role of renewable energy in combating climate change as Pakistan is still majorly dependent on fossil fuels for the daily operation.

The speakers highlighted the use of renewable energy in mitigating climate change, reducing carbon footprints, and charting a course toward energy autonomy.

The event was moderated by environmental journalist Afia Salam. She emphasized the media's role in disseminating climate change awareness.

Salam presented a view of the environmental issues, stressing that policymakers must adopt cohesive strategies within the Pakistani context.

Providing insights into Pakistan's energy generation portfolio, Zehra Aneek, an expert on energy sustainability and corporate governance, said that the country heavily relied on fossil fuels, which account for 60 percent of total energy consumption.

She elucidated the challenges in infrastructure development for renewable energy transmission and installation by citing policy barriers such as the ""solar tax"", which disincentivizes the adoption of renewable energy sources to the public.

Echoing these sentiments, Mohsin Babbar, a media person, shed light on the economic repercussions of Pakistan's energy import bills and circular debt. He emphasized the need for broadening the climate change discourse beyond urban elites to engage local communities actively.

Babbar highlighted the role of political parties, media, and digital influencers in promoting awareness and advocacy for renewable energy solutions.

Nida Farid, an aerospace engineer, said that it was important to educate the public about energy conservation in reducing utility bills and promoting energy-efficient appliances.

She underlined the necessity of dispelling misconceptions surrounding energy among policymakers to facilitate effective decision-making.

The U.S. Army garrison in Hawaii is currently conserving water after several water pumps failed this week. Soldiers, dependents and civilian contractors at the Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield are asked to not use water for ""nonessential purposes"" for the immediate future while the Army waits for the necessary parts to fix the pumps.

The pump issue impacts approximately 14,000 people, including soldiers, civilian contractors and family and community members at the Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield. . The issue came after several of the installation's clear water pumps malfunctioned earlier this week, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. Three pumps failed between Tuesday and Wednesday, a fourth failed on Thursday, after the garrison announced water conservation efforts. The water is still safe to drink, garrison officials said; the issue is just being able to pump them to distribution points.

As of this morning, only one of the installation's five clean water pumps are operational. The garrison has rented a second pump to help with providing water to the community. Currently the garrison has set up 14 water stations around the barracks and airfield to provide water to community members. The stations have potable water stored in Hippo containers (which can hold 2,000 gallons) and Buffalo containers (which can carry 400 gallons), with water provided from pumps off site. Officials said they do not anticipate the water tanks running out before the pumps are repaired. They are open from 5 a.m.-10 p.m.

Replacement parts to fix the pumps are not expected to arrive until Monday or Tuesday, March 25-26. That's due to their specialized nature, the garrison spokesman told Task & Purpose, but staff plan to ""expedite their installation.""

""We are committed to resolving this issue as swiftly as possible and have mobilized all available resources towards this end.

""We will continue to provide updates through our official channels and are working closely with local authorities and community leaders to ensure everyone has access to safe drinking water and necessary services during this period.""

At a town hall on Friday, March 22 (and viewable on the garrison's Facebook page), Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans, the commanding general for the 25th Infantry Division which is based at Schofield Barracks, apologized for the water disruption. He said that the garrison closed administrative buildings, turned off water at physical fitness centers, discontinued water usage at car washes and other efforts to preserve water. Dining facilities remain open, Evans said. While the installation waits for replacement parts, Evans said that some areas could lose water pressure and in a worst case scenario outright lose water.

Evans said that the Army is prepared to move families to temporary housing in hotels if need be. Schools on the post are currently on spring break, so schools are not being closed due to the water conservation efforts.

At Friday's town hall, Evans said that the water is safe to drink, but said that anyone with concerns about the safety of the water at the base and at the distribution points should pass their concern up the chain of command.

Artificial Intelligence is all over the news. Not long ago, Nvidia -- a leader in artificial intelligence -- surpassed Amazon's stock value, indicating a surge in demand. In many cases, AI is creating positive effects by doing things like helping to automate tasks and power research at a much faster rate. However, one concerning outcome of AI and machine learning is the unregulated development and dissemination of ""deepfake"" content.

What are deepfakes and why they are problematic

Deepfakes are created by individuals or organizations using AI algorithms to manipulate data such as images, videos, and audio recordings of a person or people. In some cases, AI is used to create helpful resources like professional headshots, but the darker side of AI revolves around malice and misinformation, where altered media is used to intimidate or harass the subject or spread lies.

X, formerly known as Twitter, briefly stopped searches of Taylor Swift after deepfake pornographic images of the singer started circulating on the internet. With the looming election, deepfakes of politicians are popping up all over the place, prompting lawmakers to regulate the phenomenon. In one case, a deepfake voice recording of Joe Biden was used to discourage Democrats from participating in the primary election, which could have swayed voting results. With outcomes like that, it's easy to question whether AI is doing more harm than good.

Dr. Federica Fornaciari, an associate professor in the Strategic Communications programs at the National University, shared her thoughts on this type of technology: "" ... It is pretty astonishing to witness how realistic these deepfakes can be, especially in a technology [sic] evolves at an incredible speed but obviously also raises critical concerns ... They've become a hotbed for ethical and societal discussion. You know, from tarnishing the reputation of public figures to spreading misinformation, they can cause pretty significant challenges for media integrity and for public trust ultimately."" The creation of deepfakes is concerning not only because of the speed of its development but also because of its unchecked regulation.

Dr. Siwei Lyu, a SUNY Empire Innovation professor of computer science and engineering with the University of Buffalo told Yellow Scene Magazine that one of his greatest concerns is that ""DeepFakes can escalate the scale and danger of online fraud and disinformation when used for deception to threaten our cognitive security. Similar to threats to our physical security or cybersecurity, which aims to break into our physical infrastructure or cyber systems, threats to cognitive security target our perceptual system and decision-making process. In particular, by creating illusions of an individual's presence and activities that did not occur in reality, DeepFakes can influence our opinions or decisions."" Although deepfakes haven't yet induced identifiable long-term change, they often create short-term chaos that can lead to disruptions and an erosion in trust in digital media, Dr. Lyu said.

Many of the problems deepfakes present are probably going to grow. ""We will likely reach a tipping point where the production of fake content outpaces our ability to detect it. This could have several implications. With this advancement, we anticipate an increase in the volume and quality of fake content on social media and the internet. The speed of generation and distribution of this content may accelerate, potentially flooding our information ecosystem. Furthermore, we might see more comprehensive disinformation campaigns that combine multimedia and multi-site illusions. Deceptive narratives could be reinforced across texts, images, videos, and audio for more compelling storytelling. Additionally, we can expect more refined and subtle forms of manipulation targeting individuals, businesses, and government agencies,"" said Dr. Lyu. Even if deepfake technology can be regulated, it will likely happen at a slower rate than the development of the technology.

With the potential growth of problems surrounding the volume of deepfake content, the speed of use, and the rise of disinformation, the technology has the potential to disrupt social platforms in a harmful way.

Why deepfake technology is useful

The development of a deepfake relies on deep learning, where an algorithm receives numerous examples which are then used to create similar images or footage. The algorithm works with an opposing algorithm to improve the final rendering. In some cases, the results can be concerning or damaging. However, the same technology that is being used to generate deepfakes can also accomplish tasks like animating historical photographs, repairing old video, or creating footage that can be used for educational purposes.

In one scenario, the Malaria Must Die campaign used deepfake technology to create a video featuring David Beckham speaking in nine different languages, encouraging viewers to petition to end malaria. This application demonstrates the potential to leverage deepfake technology for positive purposes.

While the rise of deepfake content comes with an uproar of ethical and social concerns, the technology that it uses is revolutionary. According to Dr. Lyu, ""The generative AI technology behind the production of DeepfFakes has many beneficial uses. Examples include immersive communication ... and faster video streaming ... reducing cost and effort in the movie and advertisement industry, and rehabilitation efforts for stroke patients and individuals with hearing impairment.""

The legality surrounding deepfake creation and distribution

The creation and use of most deepfakes is not currently illegal across the United States, but state laws vary. The state of Minnesota recently made it illegal to create and distribute deepfakes in cases where political ramifications and pornography creation are in question. Additionally, Georgia, Hawaii, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming have laws in place that regulate these fake videos and images.

However, lawmakers are beginning to evaluate whether or not there should be some restrictions surrounding these images and videos, particularly when it comes to nonconsensual porn. Most recently, a bipartisan bill was introduced that would allow victims to sue those who create deepfakes, knowing that there was no consent in their making. The bill came shortly after deepfakes of Taylor Swift were distributed across the internet. At this time, ten states already have laws in place that create this type of protection. The new bill would create federal protections.

Who suffers the most from deepfake usage?

One of the greatest concerns surrounding deepfake usage is how and who it may impact. While no one is immune to the use of deepfakes, this type of technology has the potential to perpetuate stereotypes and incriminate marginalized communities.

Dr. Fornaciari stated, ""Marginalized communities are particularly at risk. You know, deepfakes can exacerbate existing inequalities, they can target those who are already disproportionately disadvantaged. Manipulated content can, you know, amplify hate speech. It can fuel discrimination, it can perpetuate false narratives and further make it even more problematic for social progress to happen. Right, so we've seen the consequences of deepfakes in so many domains. In humanitarian crises or emergency situations, deepfakes can hinder relief efforts. They can exacerbate confusion. Humanitarian aid workers and those who are affected by the crisis could encounter challenges in delivering and receiving accurate information. It is scary, you know.""

The side effects of using deepfakes to create false narratives could be catastrophic for some parties. ""These are all troubling concerns, you know, deepfakes can so easily be exploited to target and harm different communities, different individuals. Again, particularly public figures but also vulnerable communities. So there are very serious consequences for the individual and for society. So media authenticity is at stake. Consumers who rely on accurate information, and incredible sources to make their informed decisions, can encounter problems there. Of course, reputation and identity can be at stake. You know, when deepfakes portray someone engaging in actions or they never did, these manipulations can have far-reaching personal and professional consequences,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

Dr. Lyu agreed that deepfakes can be dangerous and that no one is safe from their impacts. ""Deepfake attacks can target anyone. The particularly vulnerable demographics include older adults, to whom DeepFake audios can often be exploited for financial scams targeting them (e.g., grandparent scams). Women and girls are also victims of defamation attacks using DeepFakes, e.g., revenge pornography."" In most American states, the legal parameters for deepfake use have not yet been established, which makes it difficult to protect against exploitation.

The era of fake news and compromised media trust

The spread of ""fake news"" isn't anything new. Some estimates suggest that the spread of disinformation has been happening for centuries, although the term for it wasn't established until the 1890s. As technology evolves, however, fake news seems to be getting more and more convincing, and deepfakes are a great example of the harm that it can cause. As this type of tool becomes more wide-spread, so is the general mistrust of the media.

Dr. Fornaciari reflected, ""One primary concern for sure revolves around the potential for misinformation and deception. As we have said, deepfakes can pretty convincingly fabricate content. They blur the line between reality and unreality. So media consumers need to exercise caution in trusting sources. They need to develop critical thinking skills. They need to verify the authenticity of the content that they encounter and they share because there is another component here to remember."" Now more than ever, being able to verify that a media source is trustworthy and likely to convey accurate information is vital. While regulation is part of the equation when it comes to deepfakes, so is personal responsibility. Learning how to detect deepfakes can slow or stop the progress of disinformation.

Distinguishing deepfakes from real images and videos

Artificial intelligence has a shocking ability to fabricate content, which can make it difficult to determine what virtual information is trustworthy. As AI advances, the images and videos that it creates will likely be harder to evaluate for misinformation.

Dr. Fornaciari said, ""... Distinguishing authentic content, genuine content, from manipulated content becomes increasingly challenging, and this goes without saying, it can lead to skepticism or people question whether you know every piece of media they encounter is authentic or fabricated. So society may witness a pretty concerning decline in the credibility of video evidence, which can have consequences, you know, in the legal context, or they can create obstacles in determining the truth, hindering the pursuit of justice."" While historically, videos have been used as evidence in court, it is likely that the rise of deepfakes could impact this type of evidence in the future.

Fortunately, as deepfakes become popular, some industry professionals are researching ways to monitor it. Dr. Lyu reflected, ""We developed DeepFake detection methods for two primary purposes: triage and evidence. A DeepFake detector used for triage screens out a smaller subset of likely DeepFakes from a large number of images, audio, and videos for closer scrutiny. For triage detectors, the primary metric is detection accuracy, minimal human intervention, and run-time efficiency. As such, they are often implemented with data-driven, AI-based methods, directly employing machine learning models trained on real media and DeepFakes to classify them."" Being able to detect and evaluate deepfakes is a vital piece of the equation when it comes to the management of them.

As artificial intelligence progresses and continues to learn, it's likely that deepfakes will become more difficult to detect. However, there are some clues that currently allow individuals to recognize them. According to MIT, individuals who scour the internet might also look for clues like facial abnormalities, especially to the cheeks, forehead, skin, and eyes. One might also evaluate an individual's glasses for glare, facial hair, and moles. In videos, blinking and lip movements can also provide clues as to whether or not it is a deepfake.

Future management of deepfakes

When it comes to the future of deepfake management, the path isn't entirely clear. However, most experts agree that regulators need to come up with some type of management plan. ""That's something that we all need to work on, like policymakers, the legal systems, the individuals, the, you know, educators everyone should be involved. The technology companies, every. Everyone needs to work together to make sure that deepfakes are you know, that this technology is used in ethical ways, that this technology fulfills a need rather than create a problem,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

However, it isn't entirely surprising to find that the technology is making leaps and bounds faster than it can be regulated. ""Technology is always evolving faster than the legal system and the regulation, so it can be a little difficult for the legal system to keep up. But governments could explore policies that require explicit disclosure of deepfake content, for instance, and penalties for those who create and disseminate malicious deepfakes with harmful intent. But again, it's a very fine line. It's complicated to be able to create regulations that don't hinder the creation while protecting the possible harm,"" she added. While it's clear that some amount of regulation could be beneficial in the management of deepfakes, too much regulation could stunt technological advancements.

The malicious intent that often comes with the development of deepfakes is the issue that most needs to be targeted. ""Again, you know, fighting the spread of malicious deepfake content to make sure that the integrity of the media is preserved is a critical challenge, and it requires a multifaceted approach, for sure,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

Dr. Lyu's perspective surrounding deepfake management involves some level of restriction as well: ""... The current policies and regulations need to be more precise in delineating innocent and malicious use of synthetic media as the generative AI technology and synthetic media are dual-used, unless in extreme cases of misuse (e.g., generating targeted pornography videos to defame an individual), banning or restricting the technology may lead to unwanted side effects.""

Dr. Fornaciari suggests ways forward: ""... Raising awareness, promoting media literacy, is crucial. You know, as media consumers, we must be equipped with the knowledge and with the tools to identify potential deepfakes. You know, by fostering critical thinking skills, we can better discern what's authentic and what's manipulated. Collaboration between technology companies, researchers, policymakers -- everyone involved is also crucial,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.",yellowscene.com,news,Yellow Scene Magazine,,0.1137254901960785,448932217,1,https://yellowscene.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Boliden-AIillustration.jpg,eng-9421701

How is Swisspod's hyperloop technology different from its competitors?

Many of the competitors globally do active infrastructure, which means electromagnets or permanent magnets on the infrastructure itself. But, we changed that. We are looking to make infrastructures passive, which means no magnets or electrification on the rail. Therefore, the cost of the infrastructure is very comparable with high-speed rail, but with a much better energy efficiency and higher speeds.

If you have active infrastructure, that is levitation propulsion on the infrastructure, and a route of 1000 kilometres, you will have to implement 1000 kilometres of magnets along the track. Can you imagine how expensive that's going to be? Maglev (short for magnetic levitation) is running on such a system.

Therefore, as you can see, Maglev hasn't really been adopted globally because the costs and risks are very high. Just imagine if one magnet is broken-the reliability of the system is gone. You also have to de-risk such an infrastructure because it can be strategic infrastructure. Let's say you make a tunnel, it can be also utilised for defence purposes.

Can you explain how passive infrastructure works?

We put electromagnets on the vehicle and the infrastructure is fully passive, which means either a piece of aluminium or a piece of steel or a combination of the two. Then, we generate the whole electromagnetic field from the vehicle itself. Therefore, the vehicle is called self-contained because it's also powered by a battery system. The battery is driving, it's connected to a converter, the converter to a linear induction motor, and the capsule becomes active. The electromagnet is on the capsule itself and you have a very good price for the infrastructure by using only steel and aluminium. Nobody has done that before- we had to change this paradigm of seeing and of building the technology. We tested a reduced-scale model in Switzerland and we are now building a full-scale prototype in the US. In the reduced scale model, we reached a speed of 250 kilometres per hour. The first full-scale test will probably run within six to eight months from today.

What is the background to the signing of the MoU with TuTr?

We met with the Minister of Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw in Zurich when he came to Davos. We had a two-hour long meeting with him about hyperloop and he loved our concept and technology. IIT Madras is the best technology university here and TuTr Hyperloop, a spin-off from the university, is doing great. We have the same vision as TuTr about the product, when it comes to autonomous vehicles, self-contained vehicles, and passive infrastructure.

TuTr has the local and technical skills to develop the whole concept when it comes to manufacturing and producing those vehicles. The EFTA agreement that was signed recently also played a very important role for us in terms of timelines.

From a technical point of view, should hyperloop tubes be underground, on the ground, or above ground?

If you ask me what would be the best from a technical point of view, it would be to make it underground. The explanation is very simple- you have a constant temperature underground. Any material varies with the temperature, so if you have a change of temperature, everything is going to move and the tube is going to misalign. That's a bad thing to happen. Therefore, underground would be much better technically. But on the ground, of course, it's going to be much cheaper to build it. It also depends on how strategic this tube is going to be, because if you have it on the ground, it can be subject to terrorism. If you put it underground, nobody is going to have access to it. I do believe that at the beginning, for a pilot project, on the ground infrastructure is going to be better. Scientifically, I prefer to have it underground. But I think in a more pragmatic way, with good safety nearby, the tube can also be done on the ground.

An elevated, above ground track is not preferable?

Well, it's much simpler to be on the ground, right?

How do you envision the commercial use of hyperloop, be it for passengers and/or freight?

The flow rate that we're envisioning is each 30 or 45 seconds we can launch a capsule with a max payload of 30 passengers. I really believe in hyperloop as a passenger mode of transportation. The selling point for hyperloop is energy efficiency and sustainability at high speeds. Today, we do not have an alternative for high speeds- the only alternative is the aviation sector and we know about the CO2 emissions. For that reason, I believe that a government should invest in infrastructure of which the beneficiary is the passenger itself.

But, it should also be open for freight transportation. If you have 16 or 18 hours of operating time for passengers, the rest can be allocated for freight. And of course, for the first five years while we're testing our technology, it can be made for freight for safety purposes and standardisation regulations. Also, running a bit of freight before putting passengers in it will also make the case stronger in front of governments. I'm a big believer in the technology for passengers but to minimise risk at the beginning and to make some use cases, it can also be for freight.",indianexpress.com,news,The Indian Express,Aggam Walia,0.2705882352941176,448931951,10,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/hyperloop.jpg,

A hidden trend has dominated the stock market but cannot last forever. Here's how you can protect your wallet. - ExBulletin,"THE S&P500 and the Nasdaq Composite benefit from bull markets, but investors shouldn't be left asleep. The recent gains have occurred in a somewhat unusual manner and could have major implications for performance over the next couple of years. Consider this trend and its implications, and make sure your investment allocation makes sense in this context.

THE S&P 500 performance is often considered synonymous with the overall performance of the stock market. Other major indices, such as Dow Jones Industrial, provide a slightly different view depending on the sector and industry.

If these indexes are all rising, it is generally reasonable to assume that the market, as a whole, would be doing well. Some stocks will struggle for long periods of time, but gains elsewhere will more than offset those losses when indexes rise.

Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has gained 33.5%, while the Nasdaq is up 42.3%. It's tempting to look at this information and conclude that companies are performing strongly financially and that investor confidence is rising. That's a pretty fair assessment. Average sales and profits are increasing among S&P 500 components, and investor sentiment is relatively optimistic.

On the surface, everything looks positive, but an unusual trend is emerging beneath the headline data. This could have consequences for investors who ignore it.

Most indices are weighted by market capitalization. This means that stocks with higher valuations represent larger proportions in any index. This methodology makes sense: the largest companies have a considerable impact on overall economic activity and shareholder results, so the index weighting should take this into account.

This leads to a significant concentration of stock indices. The 50 largest companies in the S&P make up almost 60% of the index. Microsoft represents 7% of the S&P alone. A small number of stocks exert significant influence on most measures of total market performance.

Alternatively, some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are equally weighted, so company size and valuation have no bearing on portfolio allocation. Each share held by these funds will contribute equally to the overall performance.

By tracking the performance of equal-weighted funds, you can determine whether the smaller stocks are sharing in the total market performance. It's enlightening to compare the performance of equally weighted funds to market-weighted indices, especially if something unusual happens. And that's exactly what's happening right now.

THE Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT:RSP) has lagged the S&P 500 index by nearly 14 percentage points over the past year. There is a similar gap between the Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal-Weighted ETF (NYSEMKT:QQQE) and the Nasdaq.

Equal-weighted funds have performed well over the past year. These are above-average rates of return, but it's clear that most stocks don't thrive to the same extent as larger ones. If one simply looks at index performance, there is no way to recognize this fact.

There could be several reasons for this performance gap, but it is highly likely that the recent divergence is not sustainable. If this is the case, the consequences for the stock market will be serious over the next two years.

History suggests that the biggest stocks don't stray too far from the rest of the market over the long term. Some tech giants have enjoyed strong momentum during recent bull markets, but equal-weighted ETFs have tended to keep pace with their cap-weighted cousins.

Something has changed over the past year. THE ""Magnificent Seven"" is a group of technology stocks that have dominated the market recently.

These companies are considered leaders in relatively high-growth sectors, and many have impressed investors by cutting costs amid an uncertain economy last year. Widespread concerns about consumer strength and high interest rates have kept investors from betting on riskier growth stocks. They feared that if the economy slipped into recession, volatility would likely wipe out shareholder value.

However, the prospect of an upcoming rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made asset managers hesitant to allocate too conservatively. The Magnificent Seven offer a rare combination of reliability and above-average growth potential. This attracted a lot of capital last year, as hedge funds and retailers bought up these stocks at the start of the artificial intelligence (AI) craze.

These companies posted encouraging financial results, but the price rise was driven, at least in part, by valuation inflation. Most stocks in this group have become significantly more expensive relative to expected sales and earnings.

The Magnificent Seven are now trading at premium valuations. Unless they continue to generate significantly better financial results than the rest of the market, valuations will likely move back toward a larger balance, based on future cash flows. If that happens, these high-flying tech giants could suffer bigger losses during the next market correction, or the rest of the index could close the gap throughout this bull market.

This is why it is so important for investors to monitor the concentration of their portfolio and avoid becoming too greedy. There are many interesting stocks available in the market. It's okay to favor certain high-conviction stocks, but it's wise to rebalance your portfolio periodically when relative valuations change. Don't abandon your long-term investing thesis, but recognize that last year's winners won't necessarily be this year's winners.

It doesn't matter whether you're an index investor or hold some of these stocks individually. Make sure your expectations reflect the context of recent performance.

Germany's first UNESCO World Heritage site has been equipped by Bosch Building Technologies and the engineering firm, Plan Ing with an intelligent video solution that protects it against a multitude of potential threats.

Fires in particular can be devastating for such a historic building of inestimable intangible value - and this is precisely why Aachen Cathedral has opted for the new system, which can detect a potential danger particularly quickly: Over 50 Aviotec cameras from Bosch in 16 rooms use intelligent video analytics to visually detect smoke and flames directly at their source. Thanks to AI algorithms, the video cameras can also differentiate, for example, candlelight from a developing fire. This substantially reduces the likelihood of false alarms. Thus, the cameras respond much earlier than conventional ceiling-mounted fire detectors, which require smoke to rise to them.

""We are proud of this globally unique project at Aachen Cathedral,"" says Dr. Marcus Nadenau, Head of the European system integrator business Energy and Building Solutions at Bosch Building Technologies. ""Aviotec offers an invaluable speed advantage in fire detection, especially in buildings with complex layouts and high ceilings,"" adds Dr. Nadenau.

Cathedral master builder Dr. Jan Richarz, who took over the project from his predecessor Helmut Maintz, emphasizes the significance of this technology for the protection of Aachen Cathedral, supported by the Karlsverein / Cathedral Construction Association and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia: ""With this video surveillance solution, Aachen is a global leader. It protects our World Heritage site as reliably and innovatively as befits its historical, religious, and cultural significance. I am very satisfied with the result and the collaborative partnership,"" says Dr. Richarz.

AI protects treasures of immeasurable value

Aviotec primarily secures the cathedral's interior with its valuable relics and unique artworks, admired by over a million visitors annually. The video solution ensures that visitors can get as close as possible to the many treasures without endangering them: Aviotec raises the alarm if someone enters the virtual exclusion zones around individual exhibits. During the day, it protects the cathedral from vandalism and theft, and at night from break-ins.

Thanks to Aviotec, visitor flows can now be managed much more efficiently, as only a limited number of people are allowed in the cathedral at any one time: The previously laborious manual counting of visitors is now undertaken by the video solution.

Protecting an important building together

Bosch Building Technologies, in collaboration with the engineering firm Plan Ing, developed and implemented the comprehensive video solution for the cathedral. Every step was closely coordinated with the Cathedral Construction Lodge, whose challenging task is to preserve the cathedral and its treasures for the future. ""Aviotec from Bosch offers early fire detection and video security functions in one system, perfectly meeting the special protection needs of this sacred building,"" says Ralf Wolters from the engineering firm Plan Ing. ""Cutting-edge technology meets centuries-old treasures. This combination has excited me,"" says the engineer.

An advantage of the Aachen solution is its close integration with the local fire department: As soon as one of the Aviotec cameras detects a developing fire, the Aachen professional fire department is informed via the normatively integrated fire alarm system. A monitor shows arriving firefighters live images from the cathedral and informs them about the exact location where the danger was detected. This saves valuable time. Due to the high Aviotec standard, the fire department allowed the solution to be connected to its systems as a special detector. As the world's first system for video-based fire detection, Aviotec was certified by VdS in 2017.

Close Coordination with Heritage Conservation

To determine the ideal position for each camera within the building, digital floor plans were initially created, followed by an elaborate 3D simulation. Heritage conservation was involved early on, allowing the video system to blend almost invisibly into the existing ensemble. During the installation phase, more than 30 craftsmen worked in the cathedral at times, implementing electricity, lighting, and the new video solution in coordination. For the entire team, it was a special experience to work in a UNESCO World Heritage site.",securityworldmarket.com,news,SecurityWorldMarket.com,,0.1294117647058823,448931464,1,https://www.securityworldmarket.com/Frontend/Images/swm-logo-400x400.jpg,

With 60% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

So it follows, every decision made by insiders of Ainsworth Game Technology regarding the company's future would be crucial to them.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Ainsworth Game Technology, beginning with the chart below.

See our latest analysis for Ainsworth Game Technology

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ainsworth Game Technology?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Ainsworth Game Technology does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ainsworth Game Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Ainsworth Game Technology is not owned by hedge funds. Johann Graf is currently the largest shareholder, with 53% of shares outstanding. This essentially means that they have extensive influence, if not outright control, over the future of the corporation. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 4.5% of the stock.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.

Insider Ownership Of Ainsworth Game Technology

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that insiders own more than half of Ainsworth Game Technology Limited. This gives them effective control of the company. Given it has a market cap of AU$426m, that means they have AU$254m worth of shares. Most would argue this is a positive, showing strong alignment with shareholders. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Ainsworth Game Technology. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Private Company Ownership

It seems that Private Companies own 7.2%, of the Ainsworth Game Technology stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

aA+ aA- Allbirds inks new distribution deals for Southeast Asia, Gulf region By

Mar 23, 2024

Allbirds Inc. announced it has signed definitive agreements with distributors in the Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia, as the U.S. footwear firm shifts from direct go-to-market to third-party distribution in the region.

Alyasra Fashion, a leading fashion and footwear retailer boasting more than 25 years of experience in the Gulf region, with brands including Jimmy Choo, Cole Haan, and DKNY, will be the exclusive Allbirds distributor in the Gulf countries, while Primer Group will distribute Allbirds's products across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Other brands distributed by Asian company include Columbia, Birkenstock, and The North Face.

With these agreements, Allbirds has now completed deals with six international distributors, after shifting to third party models in Japan, Australia, Canada, and South Korea over the past few months.

""We are pleased to be expanding our international presence with industry-leading distributors,"" said Annie Mitchell, chief financial officer of Allbirds.

""The addition of these new regions via our distributor model will enable us to leverage the local knowledge and expertise of these distributors to build brand awareness and sales. These agreements highlight the continued progress we're making against our strategic shift from a direct-go-to-market model to a third-party distributor model in key international geographies.""

The change in distribution news comes on the back of a lacklustre sales update from the San Francisco-based company earlier this month.

In March, Allbirds announced fourth-quarter net revenue decreased 14.5% to $72 million, coinciding with the news that COO Joe Vernachio has been promoted to CEO, effective March 15, as co-founder Joey Zwillinger steps down his role as CEO.

Known as 'LungVax', the new vaccine is being developed by the University of Oxford, the Francis Crick Institute and University College London, and is expected to be the first of a huge range of new cancer vaccinations available in the near future.

Research scientists developing the 'groundbreaking' lung cancer vaccine claim it will be effective in preventing up to 90 per cent of cases by training the immune system to locate and attack early signs of disease.

Lung cancer cells look different from normal cells due to having 'red flag' proteins called neoantigens. The LungVax vaccine will carry a strand of DNA which trains the immune system to recognize these neoantigens on abnormal lung cells.

It will then instruct the immune system to destroy these cells and stop lung cancer.

Professor Tim Elliot, lead researcher at the University of Oxford, said: 'Cancer is a disease of our own bodies and it's hard for the immune system to distinguish between what's normal and what's cancer.

'Getting the immune system to recognize and attack cancer is one of the biggest challenges in cancer research today.""

Elliot admitted the new vaccine is based on technology used to create the Covid vaccine.

'This research could deliver an off-the-shelf vaccine based on Oxford's vaccine technology, which proved itself in the Covid pandemic.

Remarkably, given the disastrous health consequences for those vaccinated with the experimental Covid vaccines, Eilliot praised the mRNA roll out as a success.

'If we can replicate the kind of success seen in trials during the pandemic, we could save the lives of tens of thousands of people every year in the UK alone.'

Researchers have been granted up to £1.7 million from Cancer Research UK and the CRIS Cancer Foundation.

The team will receive funding for the study over the next 2 years to support lab research and initial manufacturing of 3,000 doses of the vaccine at the Oxford Clinical BioManufacturing Facility.

If successful, the vaccine will move straight into a clinical trials, involving those at biggest risk of disease, such as current and former smokers who currently qualify for targeted lung health checks in some parts of the UK.",thepeoplesvoice.tv,news,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,-0.3411764705882353,448930672,1,https://cdn.thepeoplesvoice.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/covid-vaccine.jpg.webp,

The petition, Promise Made, Promise Kept: Secure Future Paths for BC PNP International Students, is urging the B.C. government to halt its changes to the BC Provincial Nominee Program.

According to the petition, normally graduates from designated programs could directly apply for permanent resident status. With the recent update to the program, master's program graduates must now secure an official one-year skilled job offer and meet certain language criteria for eligibility.

""This sudden policy shift disrupts the paths of both current and future international students, undermining their significant financial, time, and emotional investments in their quest for a stable future in British Columbia,"" the petition said.

""Countless international students have made considerable sacrifices, both financially and emotionally, only to face such a sudden and life-altering outcome.""

The petition has more than 2,050 signatures with a goal of 2,500.

According to the province, the changes made to the nominee program will create ""clearer pathways for international workers"" and will ""make it harder for predatory recruiters and other bad actors.""

The updates include a new three-stream structure for post-secondary graduates, increased language requirements, and continued prioritization for people who work ""in-demand"" jobs.

A few hundred people attended the protest which was held at 11 a.m. at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

""I was totally in shock,"" Zongwang Wang said, a master's student in B.C.

""(The old policy) was the very reason I came here. I quit my job in New York City and moved all the way to Vancouver just two months ago because I saw the policy as a clear path ... if I study here, I have an opportunity at permanent residency.""

Wang, and many other students at the rally, believe the changes made to the program were done too quickly.

""Now because it has changed with all these new conditions and hurdles, I feel like it is unfair,"" Wang said. ""I don't feel like I was properly informed.""

Those at the rally were vocal that they want to see the policy revert to what it was before.

Global BC reached out to the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Anne Kang, but she was not available for interview.

""I sympathize with those students who may be feeling some uncertainty about what the recently announced changes to the BC Provincial Nominee Program mean for them. I know they face unique challenges as newcomers to our province, and I understand how important these matters are for them as they make career plans and begin choosing a path towards permanent residence in British Columbia,"" she said in a statement.

""The BC PNP is a very competitive program, but some have misrepresented it as an easy pathway to permanent residency. We are updating the BC PNP to give people the information they need to make informed decisions about which immigration pathway works best for them and, if they are considering the BC PNP, to ensure they are giving themselves the best chance to be nominated.""

Kang said the province is ""committed to working with students, recruiters, employers and institutions to ensure they know about these changes and understand the options available to them.""

There over 62,000 post-graduation work permit holders in B.C., most of whom are seeking a path to permanent residency.

For 2024, there are roughly 3,000 BC PNP nominations spots available.",globalnews.ca,news,Global News,,0.1686274509803922,448930665,1,https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/student-protest.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1,eng-9420839

It occurs due to a deficiency of an enzyme called lysosomal acid lipase (LAL or LIPA) enzyme, which is involved in lipid metabolism. The enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of lipids and cholesterol in the lysosomes, which are components of cells that carry out digestion of various substances.(1 ✔Trusted Source

Rare Disease Database - Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease

The incidence of CESD is considered to be 1 in 40 000. Both genders, males as well as females are affected equally. The liver is the predominant organ that is affected, resulting in liver dysfunction. Complete absence of the enzyme results in a condition called Wolman disease. The affected babies usually die within 6 months of birth.(2 ✔Trusted Source

Prevalence of Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease

Go to source)

As mentioned earlier, cholesteryl ester disease is a genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) gene located on chromosome 10.

Each of our cells has 23 pairs of chromosomes. The child gets one set of 23 chromosomes from the mother, and another set from the father, which form the pairs.

CESD is an autosomal recessive disorder. For a person to develop CESD, the defective gene should be present on both chromosomes 10, the one obtained from the father as well as the one obtained from the mother. If the gene on only one chromosome 10 is defective, the person does not suffer from the condition but can pass it on to the next generation. Such individuals are called carriers.

The LIPA gene codes for the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of fatty material, such as cholesteryl esters. When the enzyme function is reduced, these unbroken fatty materials accumulate in organs and tissues causing various effects on the body, such as increased cholesterol, enlarged liver, heart attack, and stroke, among others.(3 ✔Trusted Source

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency

Go to source)

The symptoms of cholesteryl ester storage disease vary from individual to individual. Some people display symptoms in their childhood, while others do not display any symptoms; still others display detectable symptoms in their adulthood.

The main features of CESD are enlisted below:

The diagnosis of Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease involves taking a medical history of the patient. The patientâs family history is examined to assess any hereditary involvement. A physical examination detects familiar symptoms, such as an enlarged liver.

Since CESD is the result of a deficient lysosomal acid lipase enzyme, it is useful to perform tests to analyze the defective gene. Enzyme tests can analyze the levels of the LAL enzyme in the body. The concentration of the LAL enzyme is measured in circulating peripheral blood leukocytes.

An MRI scan is useful to detect the buildup of cholesteryl esters. Enlarged liver or hepatomegaly can be detected with a CT or computed tomography scan. The calcification of adrenal glands can be detected with radiological techniques.(5 ✔Trusted Source

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency: Diagnosis and Treatment of Wolman and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Diseases

Go to source)

No specific treatment is present for CESD. The condition is treated with cholesterol reducing drugs, such as statins. Cholestyramine, fibrates, and ezetimibe can also be used to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels. A diet that is low in fats is also prescribed for the disease. When drugs and a low-fat diet are combined together, it causes a reduction in the levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the body. However, even these treatments do not appear to affect the outcome of the disease.

Liver transplant is recommended for those with badly affected livers. Liver transplants have been shown to be effective, though the procedure needs to be performed based on several factors, such as the age of the patient, the degree to which the liver is damaged, the health condition of the patient, among others.

Enzyme replacement therapy is being explored as treatment for CESD. Modified LAL enzyme introduced into the body could possibly perform the function that is compromised with the mutated enzyme. Gene therapy is also being tried out, where a normal gene is introduced into the cells, which can produce the LAL enzyme.(6 ✔Trusted Source

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency/ Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease

Go to source)

Since CESD is a genetically inherited condition, individuals who have a family history of the condition should consider genetic counselling to understand the risk of transmitting the condition to their offspring.

People who already suffer from the condition should take medications along with a low fat diet.

Regular monitoring of the patient is necessary to diagnose and treat any manifestations early.",medindia.net,news,Medindia,,-0.1137254901960785,448930646,1,https://images.medindia.net/patientinfo/950_400/causes-of-cholesteryl-ester-storage-disease.jpg,

New on-chain data from crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant shows a massive exchange of assets from long-term holders sparked by the current market outlook. According to digital asset analyst Mignolet, about 90,000 BTC was transferred in this short window from three to five-year-old wallets.

Further investigation shows that the wallets involved in the activity are trading wallets and not exchanging cold wallets.

""Two days ago, I mentioned the need to pay attention to the movements of long-term holders if buying pressure from BlackRock (IBIT) weakens. Large-scale movement of long-term holders (3y-5y) has been observed. Approximately 90,000 bitcoins have been transferred.""

On-chain analysis shows facts during the transactions that got crypto enthusiasts talking as some see more corrections with the recent movement. During price drops, the whale does not move from the bottom with exchanges occurring on price peaks.

Targeting price rise hovering around peaks shows the whale understands Bitcoin price cycles aligning with previous movements. Crypto users point to the recent volatility in the market making whales play safer.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recorded outflows in the last two days following macroeconomic factors. The upcoming halving and movement of miner reserves also played a role in reduced Bitcoin prices.

Crypto analyst, theKriptolik explained that after high prices in the market, there is a period of high volatility characterized by plunging prices forming a local dip

""On an hourly basis, the EWR has once again reached high levels. I anticipate increased volatility in Bitcoin, with a potential drop back to the 62-63 thousand dollar range, which previously served as support leading to a new local dip. Whales selling off amidst the rapid rise in BTC price will pave the way for a healthy correction.""

This healthy correction can propel Bitcoin in the coming months, bulls opine as they look to maintain pressure.

Kambiz Moez, Director of Electrical Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has developed a wireless light switch that, unlike other wireless light switches, doesn't need a battery. Instead, the switches that Moez developed run by harvesting energy from ambient sources like radio frequency signals.

In the house imagined by Moez, each floor would have one or two radio frequency power transmitters that would power all the switches.

Installing these light switches in a new home could drastically reduce the labor and materials needed to install the electrical system. That not only makes it cheaper to build and to buy, but it also decreases the amount of dirty energy needed to produce the materials, like the mining of copper to make the wire or making the synthetic rubber that coats the wire.

Moez says he developed a prototype for less than a dollar and says the system is ""scalable, easy to replicate and adopt, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of homeowners, contractors, and regulators.""

But Moez goes way beyond a wireless and battery-less light switch. What he describes is a futuristic home that maximizes efficiency and minimizes energy usage. He says the system could use sensors to detect temperature, humidity, and occupancy and automatically adjust accordingly.

""Imagine heating a 3,000-square-foot house, but you're only using a room at any given time,"" Moez said in a report by the university. ""If your house has wirelessly controlled vents, you can close the vents outside that room, or maybe a couple of bedrooms.""

Moez says the system could also turn lights on and off as someone goes from room to room.

The system would continue to save the homeowner money by reducing their energy bills and cut down on carbon pollution by reducing the use of unnecessary energy.

""By enabling the wireless control of each section of homes,"" Moez said, ""our solution prevents unnecessary use of energy, which in turn lowers energy bills and reduces carbon emissions.""

Moez's system is just one way that homes built in the future could cut down on bills and energy usage.

A group of students at the University of Wyoming teamed up with a couple of faculty advisors to build a groundbreaking net-zero energy house. The house features solar panels and a heat pump and was positioned to keep it warm in the winter months, with windows placed specifically to allow the sun's warmth to enter the home.

Another home, built in California by two architectural firms, also uses solar panels and building positioning to maximize the sun's light.

But both of those homes would be out of the price range for most people. Moez's system, when ready for widespread use, would likely be more readily available. For now, Moez and his team are still in the proof-of-concept stage.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,Stephen Proctor,0.2941176470588236,448930299,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NudPo_Fe0fYdmHjsoY9Kqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/78d81c34a419ff582e42783962a3ae5f,

The Bitcoin market has witnessed huge movements from long-term holders over the past few days following reduced sentiments from investors.

New on-chain data from crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant shows a massive exchange of assets from long-term holders sparked by the current market outlook. According to digital asset analyst Mignolet, about 90,000 BTC was transferred in this short window from three to five-year-old wallets.

Further investigation shows that the wallets involved in the activity are trading wallets and not exchanging cold wallets.

""Two days ago, I mentioned the need to pay attention to the movements of long-term holders if buying pressure from BlackRock (IBIT) weakens. Large-scale movement of long-term holders (3y-5y) has been observed. Approximately 90,000 bitcoins have been transferred.""

On-chain analysis shows facts during the transactions that got crypto enthusiasts talking as some see more corrections with the recent movement. During price drops, the whale does not move from the bottom with exchanges occurring on price peaks.

Targeting price rise hovering around peaks shows the whale understands Bitcoin price cycles aligning with previous movements. Crypto users point to the recent volatility in the market making whales play safer.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recorded outflows in the last two days following macroeconomic factors. The upcoming halving and movement of miner reserves also played a role in reduced Bitcoin prices.

Crypto analyst, theKriptolik explained that after high prices in the market, there is a period of high volatility characterized by plunging prices forming a local dip

""On an hourly basis, the EWR has once again reached high levels. I anticipate increased volatility in Bitcoin, with a potential drop back to the 62-63 thousand dollar range, which previously served as support leading to a new local dip. Whales selling off amidst the rapid rise in BTC price will pave the way for a healthy correction.""

This healthy correction can propel Bitcoin in the coming months, bulls opine as they look to maintain pressure.

At press time, Bitcoin trades at $64.968 down 1.53% this past week as liquidations slow down in the last 24 hours.

aA+ aA- Allbirds inks new distribution deals for Southeast Asia, Gulf region By

Benjamin Fitzgerald Published

Mar 23, 2024

Allbirds Inc. announced it has signed definitive agreements with distributors in the Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia, as the U.S. footwear firm shifts from direct go-to-market to third-party distribution in the region.

Alyasra Fashion, a leading fashion and footwear retailer boasting more than 25 years of experience in the Gulf region, with brands including Jimmy Choo, Cole Haan, and DKNY, will be the exclusive Allbirds distributor in the Gulf countries, while Primer Group will distribute Allbirds's products across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Other brands distributed by Asian company include Columbia, Birkenstock, and The North Face.

With these agreements, Allbirds has now completed deals with six international distributors, after shifting to third party models in Japan, Australia, Canada, and South Korea over the past few months.

""We are pleased to be expanding our international presence with industry-leading distributors,"" said Annie Mitchell, chief financial officer of Allbirds.

""The addition of these new regions via our distributor model will enable us to leverage the local knowledge and expertise of these distributors to build brand awareness and sales. These agreements highlight the continued progress we're making against our strategic shift from a direct-go-to-market model to a third-party distributor model in key international geographies.""

The change in distribution news comes on the back of a lacklustre sales update from the San Francisco-based company earlier this month.

In March, Allbirds announced fourth-quarter net revenue decreased 14.5% to $72 million, coinciding with the news that COO Joe Vernachio has been promoted to CEO, effective March 15, as co-founder Joey Zwillinger steps down his role as CEO.

When talking about a meal, the term may also mean that there was plenty of food.

When you consider an item to be worth its price, you're acknowledging that it represents good value for money. On the flip side, if a product or service doesn't justify its cost, it doesn't meet the criteria for being considered value for money.

""If something is good value for money, it is of good quality or there is a lot of it so you think the amount of money you spent on it was right.""

We can also use the term ""money well spent"" with the same meaning as ""good value for money.""

For example, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning:

In a world teeming with seemingly endless products and services, understanding the concept of ""value for money"" is more crucial than ever.

It helps us make informed decisions that balance cost and quality, ensuring that we receive the best possible return on our investment.

When seeking value for money, we consider the quality, durability, and performance of a product or service against its price. This does not mean that we simply seek out the cheapest option.

It is essentially about getting the most for our money. We are willing to pay more for something if it is of better quality, lasts longer, and performs better than a cheaper, inferior alternative.

We must consider several key factors to truly understand the concept of value for money. Let's have a look at some of them:

Top-quality items perform better, last longer, and offer more satisfaction than lower-quality alternatives.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the most expensive is the best. When weighing quality against cost, something that is priced in the mid-range may be the best option. This is where the concept of 'perceived value' comes into play -- it's the consumer's assessment of a product's worth, considering both its tangible and intangible benefits.

How long a product lasts is another crucial aspect. Something that withstands wear and tear over time does not need to be replaced as often as less durable alternatives and thus offers greater value.

How well something works is also a key indicator of value. Does a product's performance meet or exceed our expectations?

A more expensive appliance that has more features and saves energy, may, in the long run, be better value than a cheaper alternative that is more energy-hungry and has fewer functions.

Customer service, brand image, and warranties can significantly influence our perception of value for money. A product that is backed by excellent customer service and a cast-iron warranty may offer peace of mind, which enhances its overall value.

To understand good value for money, we need to evaluate these factors in relation to cost. It is neither about penny-pinching nor splurging thoughtlessly but rather about making educated choices that balance cost with durability, performance, and quality.

This approach ensures that we are not merely spending money but investing it wisely, getting the most out of every penny.

If you are a savvy consumer, you're likely familiar with the concept of good value for money. It involves more than just looking at the price tag; it also requires considering the overall benefits and drawbacks of a purchase.

By focusing on quality, durability, performance, customer care, and other benefits, you can make purchases that not only meet your immediate needs but also offer long-term satisfaction and financial savings.",marketbusinessnews.com,news,Market Business News,,0.4980392156862745,448929404,1,https://marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Good-value-for-money-thumbnail-image.jpg,

The delegation claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had come up with the Punjab Excise Policy, on the lines of Delhi Excise Policy, with the devious motive of illegally benefiting a select few.

In the memorandum, Jakhar said, ""The need of this probe assumes significance in the backdrop of the courts not only refusing bail to the already arrested Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, cabinet minister Satyender Jain and AAP MP Sanjay Singh, but also registering strong observations against the Delhi CM while acknowledging the establishment of kickbacks and money trail in the Delhi Excise Policy.""

""In Punjab, where the Bhagwant Mann-led government acted at the behest of its Delhi masters, now behind bars, to allow official plunder of Punjab's resources, there is apprehension that the state has lost at least ₹1,000 crore in revenue due to this favouritism and illegality perpetrated through Punjab excise policy,"" the memorandum stated.

""One such company whose proprietor is behind bars already for receiving illegal benefits under the Delhi Excise Policy was handpicked and awarded 40% share in Punjab liquor trade after the inception of AAP government in the state. This might just be the tip of the iceberg as far as blatant connivance of Bhagwant Mann-led government in appropriating the liquor trade in Punjab is concerned,"" Jakhar further stated.

""The probe will not only unearth corruption by AAP in Punjab but also be a step to ensure an end to further eroding of Punjab's taxpayers' money at the hands of this regime,"" said Jakhar, adding that officers of Punjab excise department had been coerced to sign on dotted lines by the AAP's state leadership.

Why no action against CM Mann, asks Sukhbir

Jalandhar: Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who was at Shaheed Bhagat Singh's ancestral village in Khatkar Kalan, on Saturday asked why no action was taken against Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann for the state's excise policy aimed at benefitting a handful of contractors.

""The Punjab excise policy was framed on the lines of the Delhi policy. The same people, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, framed the Punjab excise policy. I even gave details of the meetings which took place to frame the Punjab excise policy in Delhi.

This article dives into the latest on Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and TRON (TRX) prices and introduces a new player - the BlockDAG (BDAG) presale. Each presents a unique set of opportunities in the market. Ethereum's ETF journey faces regulatory hurdles, while TRON's price reflects market volatility. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has a strong face, tackling scalability issues with innovative solutions. The analysis aims to uncover the best crypto to buy in 2024, considering factors such as regulatory landscapes, market trends and technological innovations.

Ethereum (ETH) is a blockchain leader, but its ETH ETFs face delays due to complex regulations. Analysts believe these delays stem from misunderstandings between regulators and issuers, making Ethereum spot ETFs less likely to materialise than Bitcoin's.

Further, the prospect of staking assets on the Ethereum network poses additional challenges for key players like Fidelity and Ark. Legal uncertainties surrounding blockchain staking and proof-of-stake cryptos contribute to the regulatory impasse. While Ethereum's potential remains undeniable, the path to ETF approval remains uncertain.

TRON (TRX) maintains a volatile position in the cryptocurrency market, hovering around $?0.1177. Recent trends indicate a negative trajectory, with a 3.22% loss recently. However, TRX price has shown resilience against BTC, recording a 1.97% gain amidst market fluctuations.

These coordination compounds have promising applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis, with particular interest in solar fuel production. However, many of the photoactive transition metal complexes used in light-harvesting applications are still based on rare and expensive metals from the transition metal block. As an alternative to the popular Ru or Ir transition metal complexes, new research lines are emerging to solve the challenges in utilizing first-row transition metals, including Fe and Co. Density functional theory (DFT), has been broadly utilized to understand the underlying photophysics and quenching mechanisms of earth-abundant metal complexes excited states.An optimal match of metal and ligand is essential for achieving photoactive metal complexes. The tuning effect of interchanging the metal in a d6 hexa-carbene complex has shown the tight relationship between the metal charge and the final photoproperties. The charge induces a structural compression of the excited states favoring the occurrence of high-energy metal-centered states. The studied Co(III) complex displayed luminescence with an impressive long lifetime from a triplet metal-centered state, proving the functionality of these states. The population of triplet metal-centered states in low-spin d6 and quasi-octahedral complexes promotes several near-degenerate states with distinct structural distortions. Ab initio molecular dynamics in a Rh(III) complex, with dual emission from ligand-centered and metal-centered states, indicate that the entropy gain by geometry distortions drives the crossover reaction. Systems without metal-centered states, such as d0 titanocenes and scandocenes, also encounter distorted ligand-to-metal charge transfer states, which triggers radical ligand formation. Photochemical investigations on ligand-to-metal charge transfer states have been further extended to a Fe(III) carbene complex. Our results indicated that this complex shows a fast photoinduced charge disproportionation at high concentration, and the charge recombination occurs in the inverted Marcus regime. Diffusion of charge-separated species is also relevant to suppress recombination. The control of ion-pairing by solvent interactions promotes the hole migration of a donor molecule after quenching this Fe(III) complex. These active species can subsequently catalyze reactions, such as hydrogen production. A DFT protocol of (photo)redox potentials can assist the selection of optimal photosensitizer, donor, and proton reduction catalyst at a low computational cost. DFT also serves as a useful tool to assess multiple mechanistic reaction paths to generate hydrogen by proton reduction catalysts.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2705882352941176,448928976,1,,

Technology, with its continuous advancement, plays a pivotal role in enhancing supply chain operations, offering unprecedented levels of transparency, agility, and customer satisfaction. From harnessing data analytics for better demand forecasting to leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time tracking, technology's role in supply chain enhancement cannot be understated. This article aims to explore the various technological innovations that have revolutionized supply chain management and how businesses can leverage these advancements to stay competitive in a global market.

The integration of data analytics into supply chain management allows businesses to accurately predict future demand. By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and consumer behavior patterns, companies can adjust their inventory levels, optimize product distribution strategies, and reduce holding costs. This foresighted approach not only minimizes wastage and excess inventory but also ensures that customer demands are met efficiently, bolstering overall satisfaction.

Advanced analytics tools enable firms to identify potential disruptions in the supply chain before they occur. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can take preemptive measures to mitigate risks associated with supply chain volatility, such as supplier failures or transportation delays. This proactive stance significantly enhances supply chain resilience and reliability. The ease of document digitization and data sharing further streamlines supply chain operations, facilitating seamless collaboration between stakeholders. It not only speeds up the decision-making process but also promotes transparency, allowing businesses to build and maintain trust with their partners.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed supply chain management by enabling real-time tracking of goods and assets. With IoT devices, companies can monitor the location, condition, and movement of products throughout the supply chain. This level of visibility ensures timely delivery, reduces the risk of theft or loss, and enables companies to respond swiftly to any logistical challenges.

In addition to improving operational efficiency, the IoT also fosters enhanced communication between all stakeholders in the supply chain. By providing real-time data, everyone from suppliers to customers can have access to updated information regarding the status of goods. This transparency helps in building trust and fostering stronger relationships between businesses and their partners.

Blockchain technology offers a secure and transparent platform for conducting transactions across the supply chain. By creating an immutable ledger of transactions, blockchain ensures the authenticity of products and reduces the risk of fraud. This is particularly beneficial in industries where counterfeiting and tampering are prevalent concerns.

Blockchain's ability to provide a secure and unalterable record of transactions also facilitates smoother and more efficient customs processes. By eliminating the need for paper-based documentation, blockchain can significantly reduce delays and costs associated with cross-border trade, making global supply chains more accessible and reliable.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are redefining supply chain operations through intelligent automation and decision-making. AI-powered tools can automate routine tasks, such as inventory management and order processing, freeing up human resources to focus on more strategic initiatives. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can improve over time, continuously optimizing supply chain processes based on new data and insights.

Machine learning also plays a crucial role in identifying patterns and anomalies within large datasets, enabling companies to anticipate and address potential supply chain disruptions. By utilizing AI and ML, organizations can achieve a higher level of operational efficiency and adaptability, staying ahead in a rapidly changing market.

Sustainability has become a central focus in supply chain management, driven by increasing consumer demand for environmentally responsible practices. Technologies like IoT and AI can help businesses monitor and reduce their carbon footprint by optimizing routes, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing waste. This not only aligns with global sustainability goals but also positions companies as socially responsible, enhancing their brand image and customer loyalty.

Innovations such as circular supply chains, where resources are reused and recycled, also contribute to environmental sustainability. By leveraging technology to facilitate a circular economy, businesses can reduce their environmental impact while creating a more resilient and future-proof supply chain.

Technology is continuously transforming the supply chain landscape, offering immense potential for businesses to improve their operations and stay competitive. As new advancements emerge, it is crucial for companies to embrace a proactive approach towards integrating technology into their supply chain strategies. By staying abreast of technological innovations and leveraging them effectively, businesses can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, foster transparency and sustainability, and ultimately achieve success in the global market.

Over the years, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has laid out various justifications for his ""hugs, not bullets"" policy of avoiding clashes with the cartels. In the past he has said ""you cannot fight violence with violence,"" and on other occasions he has argued the government has to address ""the causes"" of drug cartel violence, ascribing them to poverty or a lack of opportunities.

But on Friday, while discussing his refusal to go after the cartels, he made it clear he viewed it as part of what he called a ""Mexico First"" policy.

""We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government,"" López Obrador said at his daily news briefing. ""Mexico First. Our home comes first.""

López Obrador basically argued that drugs were a U.S. problem, not a Mexican one. He offered to help limit the flow of drugs into the United States, but only, he said, on humanitarian grounds.

""Of course we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl,"" the president said. Over 70,000 Americans die annually because of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are mainly made in Mexico from precursor chemicals smuggled in from China.

López Obrador's view -- like many of his policies -- harkens back to the 1970s, a period when many officials believed that Mexican cartels selling drugs to gringos was a U.S. issue, not a Mexican one.

""For decades, past administrations in Mexico have thought the war against drug cartels was basically a U.S. problem,"" said security analyst David Saucedo, noting that Mexican domestic drug consumption, while growing -- especially methamphetamines -- is still at relatively low levels.

""On the other hand, the drug cartels provide jobs in regions where the Mexican government can't provide economic development, they encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade and investment deficits.""

López Obrador has argued before against ""demonizing"" the drug cartels, and has encouraged leaders of the Catholic church to try to negotiate peace pacts between warring gangs.

Explaining why he has ordered the army not to attack cartel gunmen, López Obrador said in 2022 ""we also take care of the lives of the gang members, they are human beings.""

He has also sometimes appeared not to take the violence issue seriously. In June 2023, he said of one drug gang that had abducted 14 police officers: ""I'm going to tell on you to your fathers and grandfathers,"" suggesting they should get a good spanking.

Asked about those comments at the time, residents of one town in the western Mexico state of Michoacan who have lived under drug cartel control for years reacted with disgust and disbelief.

""He is making fun of us,"" said one restaurant owner, who asked to remain anonymous because he -- like almost everyone else in town -- has long been forced to pay protection money to the local cartel.

""The president said out loud what we had suspected for a long time, that his administration is not really fighting the drug cartels,"" said Saucedo, the security analyst. ""He has only decided to administer the conflict, setting up what may have to be a crusade against the cartels in the future that he won't have to fight.""

López Obrador has also made a point of visiting the township of Badiraguato in Sinaloa state, the home of drug lords like Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzman, at least a half dozen times, and pledging to do so again before he leaves office in September.

It's also a stance related to prickly nationalism and independence. Asked in November why he has visited the sparsely populated rural township so many times, López Obrador quoted a line from an old drinking song, ""because I want to.""

The president has imposed strict limits on U.S. agents operating in Mexico, and limited how much contact Mexican law enforcement can have with them.

The U.S. Embassy in Mexico had no comment on López Obrador's most recent remarks. But it did note the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Friday on a Sinaloa Cartel money-laundering network in which the proceeds of fentanyl sales were used to buy shipments of cell phones in the United States, which were then sold in Mexico.

John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, credited ""strong partnership with the government of Mexico, with which we coordinated closely and for which, we are grateful,"" in investigating that case.

While Mexico has detained a few high-profile gang members, the government's policy no longer matches what Mexican drug cartels have become: extortion machines that make much of their money, not from trafficking drugs, but extorting protection payments from businessmen, farmers, shop owners and street vendors, killing anyone who doesn't pay.

They take over legitimate businesses, kill rival street-level drug dealers, and murder bus and taxi drivers who refuse to act as lookouts for them.

The cartels control increasingly large swathes of territory both in northern Mexico -- their traditional base -- and in southern states like Guerrero, Michoacan, Chiapas and Veracruz.

It is unclear if peaceful coexistence was ever possible with Mexican drug gangs. While some regions have produced marijuana or opium poppies for at least 50 years, the illegal trade always brought violence.

López Obrador claims the ""Mexico First"" policy is needed to reduce domestic violence. Last year, he claimed Mexico saw a drop of 17% in homicides under his administration. But in fact homicides had already fallen about 7% from their mid-2018 peak when López Obrador took office in December of that year. The president is essentially taking credit for a drop that started under his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto.

The most reliable annual count shows that homicides in Mexico declined by 9.7% in 2022 compared to 2021, the first significant drop during the current administration. Mexico's National Statistics Institute said there were 32,223 killings in 2022.

The country's homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants dropped from about 28 in 2021 to 25 in 2022. By comparison, the U.S. homicide rate in 2021 was about 7.8 per 100,000 inhabitants.",cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,,-0.003921568627450966,448928877,1,https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/23/3a9428e2-966a-4624-92a1-ddc6b60fea87/thumbnail/1200x630/84b45905b03baf1d3676f130dbcd839f/mexico.png?v=4baa656f7af774a52a8c6a88476cb826,

Youngkin, protect us and sign the tree conservation bills","At issue is the need for more stringent tree conservation laws versus the costs incurred by developers and builders when having to protect existing canopy. The problem, I believe, is that developers and builders only look at up-front costs (which they are more responsible for) and not the long-term impact of tree removal (typically the burden of nearby residents -- including those who may move into the new development).

Established trees and their canopy are, quite literally, a free stormwater retention device (one medium-sized tree can treat 1 inch of rain from 2,500 square feet of impervious surface -- more than 1,500 gallons); free localized climate control (mature trees in suburban areas reduce their immediate temperatures by 4-6 degrees Fahrenheit); and, yes, they remove significant pollutants from the air such as carbon dioxide, sulfur and other particulate matter (notable given particulate matter is responsible for more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. each year).

These benefits, again, are absolutely free and achieved by literally doing nothing but allowing as many mature trees to remain as possible. Developers can be creative (search ""spite house"") and are capable of working within tree conservation limits. I ask Youngkin to consider these benefits and pass legislation to protect existing tree canopy.

Although Norfolk's mayor is great at ribbon-cuttings, he certainly seems less communicative in addressing the problems facing the city. I question if Norfolk is slowly becoming a relic of the past when bars, gambling and prostitution ruled downtown.

Mayor, what is the status of MacArthur Center, Scope Arena, Military Circle and Maury High School? Is the casino still a reality, and how about ""skill games"" in our neighborhoods? How is flooding being addressed, considering Norfolk is one of the most flood-prone cities in the U.S.? What about affordable housing, poverty and homeless people?

What about our public education system? (Is a Ghent or West Ghent elementary school on the chopping block?) What about our poor transportation system? (Should fares for riding The Tide be eliminated?)

What about the coal dust problem? Residential recycling and waste from industrial, retail and restaurant sectors? The wind project? Traffic control and street speed cameras? The $17.8 million budget surplus? Crime or gun control? And, lest we forget, systemic racism? Whew.

I fear many of these issues are holding back the city from attracting new businesses and residents. The city needs to use its imagination in creating new strategies and opportunities for positive change in Norfolk and communicate them to its residents. It's a part of government transparency, and inquiring minds want to know. Stop being a ""Waldo"" or a ""Carmen Sandiego.""

Re ""A bill protecting birth control access is headed to Virginia's governor. Here's why Republicans said they opposed it."" (March 1): The article stated that state Sen. Danny Diggs voted against birth control for women. Then, he ""acknowledged he might have misunderstood the bill"" he voted against. I am really concerned that he doesn't pay attention to bills that he votes for or votes against, especially one that has such an impact on women. What should we do about men's reproductive rights? Maybe, we should have a bill for that.

Also, I saw that he campaigned as a pro-life person. Again, what does he plan to do for men? Will he always vote against women? Is his misunderstanding just a cop-out or because he follows Gov. Glenn Youngkin?

Mark Twain is credited with saying, ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."" That seems to be true today. In September 1940, the America First Committee was formed. It was an isolationist movement and campaigned against military preparedness and involvement in the war in Europe. It grew to more than 800,000 members.

Charles Lindbergh, a true American hero and a spokesman for the group, gave a speech in which he railed against Jews and the Roosevelt administration and published an article stating, ""That our civilization depends on a Western wall of race and arms which can hold back ... the infiltration of inferior blood,"" according to a PBS article. He had visited Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Although his speech was not well received by those in power, it did reflect the views of many who had not yet recovered from the Great Depression. The recent pandemic, although not as long-lasting, had effects that were similar.

So today, we have former President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. He is an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, talks about immigrants ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" opposes NATO and rails against the Biden administration.

The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, after reaching its all-time high, experienced a pullback, and Ethereum also got its share of this situation. However, Ethereum's situation is following a unique trajectory.

ContentsA Different Scenario Unfolds for Altcoin EthereumSupport and Resistance Levels for ETH A Different Scenario Unfolds for Altcoin Ethereum

The cryptocurrency Ethereum, after seeing its yearly high of $4,094, faced a downward movement. This led to the price trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) in both the 1-hour and 4-hour time frames. However, a different picture emerges in the daily time frame.

So, what path will Ethereum's price take from here on? This question is on the lips of many cryptocurrency investors. At the moment, the price of Ethereum is trading around approximately $3,360 and has recorded an increase of 0.64% in the last 24 hours.

However, the real question that intrigues everyone is: Will the price continue downward, or will it reverse direction and start an upward movement? This is indeed a critical point. The volatile nature and uncertainty of the cryptocurrency markets make it difficult to make a definite prediction. At this point, it is beneficial to look at support and resistance levels.

Support and Resistance Levels for ETH

Currently, a support level at $3,067 and corresponding resistance levels at $3,681 and $3,591 can be identified through technical analysis. However, these levels may change with the constant movement of the market.

When examining the 4-hour time frame chart, it is observed that the price is trading below the 100-day moving average. This indicates that the price is in a downtrend.

Looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, it is seen that the RSI signal line is trading below the 50 line. This can be interpreted as a strong signal that the price of the king of altcoins, Ethereum, is in a downward trend.

A closer look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour time frame shows that the MACD histogram has fallen below the zero line and both the MACD line and the signal line have crossed below the zero line. This suggests that the price is still in a downtrend and this trend could continue.

This noble gesture by the government reflects a deep sense of commitment to the welfare and well-being of the citizens, especially in the face of economic challenges such as rising costs of foodstuffs and inflation.

In a press statement, the BAA highlighted the importance of governance not just as the exercise of power but also as the responsibility to cater to the needs of the people. The distribution of grains as Ramadan palliative is seen as a proactive step taken by the state government to alleviate the suffering of its citizens during a time of economic uncertainty and hardship.

The chairman of BAA, Lawal Sani Ningi, commended Governor Mohammed for his dedication to serving the people of Bauchi State with honesty, fairness, and transparency.

It is commendable that the state government has set up a committee comprising critical stakeholders to ensure that the distribution process is fair and transparent. This demonstrates Governor Mohammed's commitment to accountability and integrity in governance.

The decision to provide N2bn worth of grains as Ramadan palliative is a direct response to the challenges faced by the citizens, as they grapple with the impact of food insecurity and inflation. The collaboration with the federal government and other organizations has made it possible for citizens to access essential food items during this critical period.

Governor Mohammed's leadership and compassion in spearheading this initiative have been lauded by the BAA. His proactive approach to addressing the needs of the most vulnerable members of society sets him apart as a true servant of the people. By prioritizing the welfare of the citizens and taking concrete steps to alleviate their suffering, Governor Mohammed has shown exemplary leadership marked by empathy and integrity.

The distribution of food palliatives during Ramadan signifies the government's sensitivity to the needs of its diverse population. It not only fulfills a duty but also fosters a sense of solidarity and care within the community.

This initiative serves as a shining example of effective governance and sets a benchmark for other states to follow in addressing the socio-economic challenges facing their communities.

The Bauchi State Government's commitment to citizen welfare through the distribution of N2bn worth of grains as Ramadan palliative is a testament to Governor Mohammed's dedication to serving the people with honesty, fairness, and transparency.

The tough question to answer is how access can be extended without adding to global warming by relying on fossil fuels.

We -- a team from Rwanda and Germany who work in the field of renewable energy scientific modelling -- set out to find the answer by building the Renewable Power Plant Database Africa, the first on the continent.

It is a database of available open access data on hydro, wind and solar energy sources that we have analysed.

The database shows that some countries, such as Nigeria and Zimbabwe, have enough projects in the pipeline to potentially transition away from fossil fuels by 2050.

It also shows that 76 percent of all electricity required on the continent could come from renewable resources by 2040.

This would happen if the capacity of existing hydro, solar and wind power plants were fully utilised and if all plants currently on the drawing board were built. The 76 percent from renewables would be met by 82 percent hydropower, 11 percent solar power and 7 percent wind power.

Hydropower has been the main renewable energy resource to date, but declining costs for solar photovoltaics (90 percent decline since 2009) and wind turbines (55-60 percent decline since 2010) mean solar and wind have potential to lead sustainable renewable energy options.

We conclude that combining the advantages of hydropower with wind and solar energy would be a more sustainable alternative to hydropower alone.

And that hybrid solution would be the best option. But none of this can happen unless countries are willing to get into transnational electricity sharing arrangements.

In addition, providing openly accessible and location-specific data is fundamental for the development of an integrated sustainable renewable energy mix.

What the data says

We compiled the publicly available records of 1 074 hydropower, 1 128 solar and 276 wind power plants into one database.

These were both existing and planned plants.

We included the location of each proposed plant for all African countries.

We then integrated the data into a harmonised and updated database.

This is the first comprehensive overview of renewable energy plants in Africa that includes their geographic coordinates, construction status and capacity (in megawatts).

This database shows that some countries have enough projects in the pipeline to potentially transition away from fossil fuels.

Hydropower is used by Eswatini, Angola, Djibouti, Gambia, Cameroon, Tanzania, Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of Congo as a major or main source of renewable electricity.

Other countries, including Egypt, South Africa, Algeria, Libya, Cape Verde, Morocco and Tunisia, are lagging behind in renewable energy development.

These countries are highly electrified and their economies depend strongly on fossil fuels.

We found that hydropower could more than double to 132GW. This would happen if those plants that have already had feasibility studies carried out were built. The Aswan High Dam has an installed capacity of 2,1GW and generates most of Egypt's energy. So, 132GW would be enough to provide power for several countries.

However, hybrid solutions are more likely to provide reliable electricity to a growing population in a changing climate.

The cost of wind and solar power is dropping, while a recent analysis concluded that barely any hydropower will be profitable after 2030.

If hydropower is not a favourable option under future climate change scenarios, wind and solar will be able to step in.

Hybrid power plants that generate a combination of renewable energy are another option.

A promising example of this is the installation of floating solar panels on existing reservoirs.

Share electricity, data and experience across borders

To meet the demand across Africa, we recommend the following:

Firstly, that there is international electricity sharing between African countries.

This is the only way to ensure a renewable electricity supply to all countries.

Secondly, African leaders must also move away from economic-driven development and integrate the different interests from people involved or affected, such as local residents, the general population, and governmental and non-governmental organisations.

Thirdly, renewable energy development must include the interests of different people involved or affected by new energy projects, such as local communities and the general population.

In the past, the land-intensive expansion of renewable power plants has caused conflicts with farmers, national parks and industries.

Fourth, governments must share experience across borders to avoid mistakes such as damming the Nile River for hydropower.

The Aswan High Dam, for example, disturbs the transport of sediments down to the delta of the Nile, threatening the highly biodiverse wetlands and inducing shoreline erosion, putting humans at risk.

The Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, currently under construction, is a recent prominent example of the need for cooperation and river management across borders, especially when facing potential impacts of climate change like droughts on the efficiency of the hydropower plant.

Fifth, we call for a general rethink on how data is managed.

All data should be shared and openly accessible across the world.

Countries need to share high-quality data. This includes data on their power plants.

High-quality data is key to analysing the different routes that electricity development should take across the continent in future.

Such projections are only as good as the knowledge and data they are based on.

African countries that follow this route will be global role models for a renewable energy transition. -- theconversation.com",sundaymail.co.zw,news,Sunday Mail Zimbabwe,,0.1294117647058823,448928030,1,https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/SOLAR.jpg,eng-9415511

The DSWD 7, in a statement, said it consulted with LGUs to determine the most suitable distribution scheme, as it aims to align the distribution process with the prevailing status, physical conditions and geographical location of the beneficiaries.

Based on Memorandum Circular 17, the transition of the stipend distribution considers three delivery schemes: (a) cash advances facilitated by special disbursing officers, (b) door-to-door delivery services for critically ill beneficiaries, and (c) the transfer of funds to LGUs.

The DSWD 7, however, said the transfer of funds to LGUs method stands out for its efficiency, enabling fast and convenient distribution while considering administrative limitations and workforce constraints within DSWD field offices.

The Social Pension program, designed to aid the elderly with maintenance medicine or subsistence, has undergone a substantial augmentation following the implementation of Republic Act 11916 in 2022.

The senior citizen's stipend has been increased from P500 to P1,000, with the agency transitioning from quarterly to semestral payouts.

The adjustment aims to alleviate the impact of high inflation, particularly on essential commodities like rice.

The agency visited LGUs in Cebu Province on Feb. 23-24, 2024, with other consultation dialogues scheduled for Bohol, Negros Oriental and Siquijor provinces.

The DSWD 7 said several LGUs have already opted for the fund transfer scheme.

In 2023, at least 80 LGUs adopted this approach, with an additional 42 LGUs joining in 2024.

Among the first towns to implement the distribution of increased stipends are Getafe town in Bohol, Tudela town in Cebu, and Bacong in Negros Oriental.

Leah Quintana, information officer of DSWD 7, told SunStar Cebu on Wednesday that the schedule of the semestral payouts, or twice-a-year distribution of P6,000 to the beneficiaries, varies per LGU.

She added that they do the fund transfer to LGUs annually.

SunStar earlier reported that at least 299,737 senior citizens located in Central Visayas are beneficiaries of the program.

Of the beneficiaries, 127,439 are from Cebu, 99,490 are from Bohol, 62,287 from Negros Oriental and 10,521 from Siquijor.

There is currently a more advanced system under development.

The United Kingdom's appeal to skilled professionals is undeniable, with its dynamic economy and world-renowned universities attracting talent worldwide. The Skilled Worker Visa, used by healthcare professionals, IT professionals and others, has served as a crucial work visa pathway. However, recent immigration policy changes are fundamentally altering the landscape, with significant salary threshold increases and the removal of the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). These changes have far-reaching implications for businesses with a sponsor licence seeking to sponsor foreign talent through the issuance of Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS).

The UK government's announcement of a substantial hike in the minimum salary threshold for Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship (excluding Health and Care Worker Visas), from £26,200 to £38,700 effective April 4, 2024, has sent shockwaves through the immigration system. This policy shift goes beyond streamlining talent acquisition; it's a clear attempt to reduce immigration numbers. Further restrictions, like the removal of dependant rights for certain visa categories, reinforce this objective.

The announcement triggered a surge in visa applications as individuals rushed to secure visas under the current lower salary threshold. This surge has placed significant strain on immigration services already contending with Brexit complexities and the COVID-19 pandemic.

UK businesses reliant on skilled foreign labor face new challenges. The increased sponsorship costs associated with the higher salary threshold threaten to exacerbate existing talent shortages in sectors like technology. With the removal of the Shortage Occupation List, businesses will no longer have the option of reduced salary requirements for in-demand roles, further increasing costs and making it more difficult to secure the necessary CoS to sponsor workers. Industry leaders and associations are voicing concerns about the policy's impact on their ability to find and retain skilled workers, potentially impacting business growth and the UK's global competitiveness.

The Health and Care Worker Visa route is subject to its own salary adjustments. Effective April 4, 2024, the minimum salary for most roles under this visa increases from £20,960 to £23,200. Healthcare workers must be paid the higher amount if the typical salary (""going rate"") for their specific job exceeds this minimum. Specific rates apply to nurses, midwives, and some allied health professionals, while healthcare workers with PhDs relevant to their job may still be eligible for some flexibility.

The healthcare sector serves as a prime example of potential policy pitfalls. Increased salary requirements for healthcare roles and new sponsorship rules for care workers (including CQC registration requirements for employers) could exacerbate existing staffing shortages. Healthcare representatives have expressed deep concern about the impact on their ability to provide quality patient care and the UK's future ability to address labor shortages in the sector. The added hurdle of higher salary costs impacting their ability to secure CoS further compounds the challenges faced by healthcare employers.

The increase in the Skilled Worker Visa salary threshold (with the exception of the Health and Care Worker Visa), along with the removal of the Shortage Occupation List, marks a critical juncture in UK immigration policy. The government it seems wants more highly skilled professionals to reduce immigration levels. However, the overall objective of reducing immigration numbers carries significant risks, particularly regarding employers' ability to obtain the necessary skilled workers to address workforce needs. Time will reveal the policy's long-term impact on the UK's workforce, economy, and global standing.

This comes as the Zimbabwe dollar has been losing ground against the US dollar, which has seen the exchange rate being noticeably unstable since December last year.

In the recent past, the instability has been driven by several factors including speculative behaviour, an increase in market liquidity and suspected economic saboteurs amid already high demand for foreign currency.

In an interview after touring Bulawayo's manufacturing giants, Arenel Foods and Baker's Inn, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said the monetary policy statement will be released soon.

""We are working on some measures, people should be patient, we will release a monetary policy statement in the not-so-distant future which will deal with volatility and weakness in the currency.

""Just be patient, we want to make sure that we do it right, undertaking some consultation with various stakeholders in the industry, within Government and international organisations, but also some currency experts that we have consulted. We want to make sure that we have all the arsenal of knowledge that is needed to produce a lasting solution to the volatility and weakness of the currency,"" he said.

Early this year, the exchange rate instability resulted in price increases of products and services, putting them beyond the reach of many, but several swift interventions by the Government restored sanity in the market.

Meanwhile, on tackling the informal sector, Prof Ncube said various strategies were in place to ensure they address the challenges of informalisation in the market.

""So we have tried to use the route to market rules to deal with that, which requires formal businesses that are dealing with the informal businesses to require some registration such as value added tax (VAT) registration and at least charge VAT withholding tax and so forth.

""We are using the formal businesses to deal with the informal businesses that has been one strategy. The other strategy has been the intermediated money transfer tax (IMTT) which we believe has gone a long way in formalising some of the businesses that were not paying their taxes,"" he said.

Prof Ncube said the Government was also aware of the challenges of some businesses requiring cash payments thereby escaping the IMTT, while the third strategy was the presumptive tax levied on informal traders, small-scale miners, cottage industry operators, transport operators, hair salons and bottle store owners among others.

""As you can see, it is a combination of things where we are saying if these informal operators operate from a known address let's say it's a huge warehouse and we have seen those businesses around the city.

""So we designate the owner of the building as a tax collection agent and then we have put in place a presumptive tax to say for each individual occupying space in a building please collect US$1 a day, that's the tax. If you do not, you are mandated by the law,"" he added.

The minister said there was also the location tax which he introduced about two years ago, as part of the multiplicity of strategies to try and get to the informal sector.

""It is never easy, someone will always escape. As the Government, we are not concerned about the person who is trying to survive and they are selling something around the corner they are just trying to survive. l do not expect taxes from those individuals frankly, we are looking at the more serious informalised businesses that is where we should be focusing and that is what we are trying to do as the Government,"" he said.",sundaynews.co.zw,news,Sunday News,,-0.01960784313725494,448927769,1,https://www.sundaynews.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2023/02/gfhfbfvb.jpg,

But their days may be numbered

Minibuses have plied Hong Kong urban streets and rural roadways for more than 50 years, providing swift and inexpensive transport options to the phalanxes of buses, taxis, trams and MTR trains. Ubiquitous, the green- and red-top minibuses also offer daily symbols of the city’s charm, even spawning die-cast models and Christmas ornaments to hang alongside one’s mini Star Ferry or red Crown taxi. It is therefore concerning, from the vantage of nostalgia as well as convenience, that reports again suggest their days may be numbered.

The Covid pandemic, expanding bus and MTR networks, changes in tunnel tolls and higher interest rates have combined to eat into revenues. Passenger numbers fell from 1.76 million a day in 2019 to 1.46 million a day last year. Permit fees also dropped from HK$8 million in 2011 to HK$700,000, undercutting assets used as collateral. Squeezed by loans, operators have faced action by lenders, prompting some to abandon their vehicles at route stops or in the countryside.Hong Kong’s minibuses are struggling. Will they soon be replaced?

Launched illegally in 1967 when riots led to strikes on public transport, the red minibuses were allowed to operate legally two years later, and a year later the government introduced franchised green-tops. About three quarters of the 4,350 vehicles are green-tops running on fixed routes and schedules with salaried drivers. Less regulated, red-top drivers can largely set their routes, fares, and when to operate. They can stop anywhere, on a dime, to collect or drop off passengers, often providing the only way to swiftly and cheaply reach far-flung areas. Drivers must make up daily rent, so a ride on a red-top – also known as a “desperado minivan” – can easily become a white-knuckle affair as they hurtle along to make as many trips as possible. The city in 2004 required minibuses to install large speedometers visible to the riders to encourage them to slow down.

The inevitable advent of cutting-edge transport like self-driving vehicles as a means to make up a smart last-mile solution for transportation will add to financial pressure on the minibuses, and taxis, now serving that need. Ultimately market forces will decide which routes survive, and indeed, how long the minibuses themselves have before they go the way of the rickshaw.",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.05882352941176472,448927489,1,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_editorial/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/23/94f3eace-356b-4f6a-bf8b-70baa0686218_76ed41e1.jpg?itok=_Jvbodfv&v=1711204271,

That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.

A belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps.

Troise AP Business Writer

NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks closed their best of the year so far with a quiet finish on Friday, remaining near their records.

The S&P 500 slipped 7.35 points, or 0.1%, from its all-time high to close at 5,234.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.47, or 0.8%, to 39,475.90, and the Nasdaq composite rose 26.98, or 0.2%, to 16,428.82 to add to its record.

Nike dragged on the market after falling 6.9%. It reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it's in the midst of several fundamental changes to inject more newness into its shoes and other products to make them more popular.

Shares of Lululemon Athletica also dropped despite a better-than-expected profit report. The athletic apparel company gave forecasts for revenue and profit over the upcoming fiscal year that fell short of analysts' expectations, and it sank 15.8%.

Reddit fell 8.8% to give back some of the big gain from its dynamic debut on the U.S. stock market. The eclectic bazaar of online communities offered its stock at an initial price of $34 a share and gained 48.4% in its first day of trading on Thursday.

Helping to support the market was FedEx, which climbed 7.4% after reporting stronger profit than expected despite what it called ""a difficult demand environment.""

Some of the market's wildest action was centered on Digital World Acquisition Corp. The company's shareholders on Friday approved a merger with the company behind former President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform. Its stock went from a 12% gain early in the day to a drop of 13.7%

The stock had been on a spectacular run this year as Trump has marched toward the Republican nomination for president. But it began falling shortly after Digital World shareholders approved the merger, which would see Trump Media & Technology Group shares trade under the symbol DJT and replace Digital World's DWAC.

Critics have said Digital World's stock is much, much higher than the businesses' fundamentals suggest, and Truth Social has been losing money.

In the bond market, Treasury yields sank to pull back further for the week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20% from 4.27% late Thursday.

Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve indicated that it still may deliver three cuts to interest rates this year, as long as inflation keeps cooling. That calmed worries on Wall Street that several hotter-than-expected inflation reports this year could force it to take rate cuts off the table.

The Federal Reserve's main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and Wall Street is hoping for cuts to begin in June. Such reductions would relieve pressure on the economy and financial system.

Continued expectations for a coming Fed pivot on rates are likely to support stocks, along with surging investment in artificial intelligence and several other drivers for the market, according to David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.

But he sees the S&P 500 ending the year close to where it is now, after it's already leaped nearly 10% so far in 2024.

In stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled 2.2% in Hong Kong and 0.9% in Shanghai but moved more modestly elsewhere in mixed trading across the rest of Asia and Europe.

With the global population expected to reach close to 10 billion by 2050, humanity confronts the formidable challenge of boosting food production by 50% to meet this heightened demand. Addressing this challenge entails not only increasing production but also fortifying the sustainability and resilience of our food systems to ensure food security which is defined as the state when every individual, without exception, has the physical and economic means to access sufficient, safe and nutritious food meeting their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.

Globally, India ranks poorly in food security and hunger indices, standing 68th out of 113 countries in the 2022 Global Food Security Index and 111th out of 125 countries in the 2023 Global Hunger Index. Numerous factors contribute to India's food insecurity, including poverty, social inequality, limited food access, price fluctuations, agricultural challenges, land ownership issues, food wastage, and natural disasters. Deforestation and climate change exacerbate these factors.

Early human societies, initially nomadic, thrived on diverse wild foods, enjoying well-nourished diets. However, between 8000-4000 BCE, a shift to settled farming and animal domestication marked the onset of agriculture, laying the groundwork for future civilizations. The rise of kingdoms and empires saw advancements in irrigation, food production, and trade. During the colonial era, large forest areas were cleared and brought under cultivation of crops that included sugarcane, cotton, spices, and fruits enriching India's food diversity.

Even after independence, forest lands considered suitable for crops continued to be diverted for the purpose for quite some time. The Green Revolution aimed at boosting food production and self-sufficiency through high-yielding crop varieties like rice, wheat, and maize; though progressively providing subsidies to farmers. This shift led to the decline of numerous traditional and locally suited crop varieties with high nutritional value. This era also witnessed the rise of global food conglomerates, reshaping India's food security scenario often at the expense of small-scale and local producers. Parallelly globalization and urbanization introduced new cuisines, standardizing preferences leading to the decline of many diverse and traditional nutritious dishes, resulting in crop production systems becoming homogeneous and vulnerable to shocks and stresses.

India's agricultural sector and accordingly the farmers, though more specialized, became heavily dependent on external inputs and subsidies, and purely market-oriented. With just 12 crops and 14 animal species providing 98% of the world's dietary needs, achieving sustainable food security by 2050 is indeed a complex challenge suggesting a relook at the crucial role of forests as foster mothers to agriculture.

In contrast to agriculture as an energy production system forests harbour a diverse range of flora and fauna, including pollinators and natural resources for germplasm conservation. Sustaining vital life processes such as nutrient cycling and water regulation in watersheds, they have the potential to safeguard and enrich the soil. They serve as a natural bulwark against climate change and extreme weather and nurture agriculture. Additionally, forests also provide a variety of nutritious foods like fruits, tubers, leaves, vegetables, honey and wild plants and resources supporting the traditional systems of medicine.

Forests are crucial for the dietary diversity and nutrition of forest-dependent people in addition to working as a vital support during times of scarcity. In addition, forests also offer financial opportunities like the sale of minor forest produce which contributes to income to be used to purchase diverse food items from markets. It's not surprising that there are no farmer suicide cases reported from villages in and near good forest areas.

With rising populations, however, human encroachments and changes in land use are setting the stage for wildfires, pests, and zoonotic diseases to wreak havoc. The dwindling forested areas pose a triple threat - escalating land degradation, depleting water resources, and risks to agriculture. The dependence of one-third of the world's population on forest goods and services, however, clashes with the harsh reality that 80% of the annual net forest loss is attributable to agriculture.

Notwithstanding the damage caused to the natural systems and eco-processes due to anthropogenic forces, our production methods are also increasingly taxing the environment. They consume 70% of the world's freshwater resources, emit nearly a third of all greenhouse gases, and heavily rely on fossil fuels for fertilizers and machinery. These practices already influenced by lost culinary diversity are pushing production limits to an undeniably unsustainable point. The situation in India ranked amongst the first five countries in the world in agricultural production, is no different.

India's food security intricacies are deeply intertwined with the dynamics of forest conservation and agriculture. A diverse array of stakeholders; including forest dwellers, farmers, pastoralists, private companies, and government bodies each have their unique interests, rights, and responsibilities about forest as a resource. Farmers pushed against the wall, are made to believe that the remedy for their lower returns lies just in subsidies and MSP. With this approach, ensuring food security on a sustained basis is going to be difficult.

The poor implementation of the Forest Rights Act 2006 has triggered recognition of cultivation rights to ineligible people, that too on refractory lands, promoting thereby further encroachments into forest lands in India. Fragmentation of wildlife habitats and liberal diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes have increased crop predation and human-wildlife conflicts. There is a dearth of studies indicating whether the ownership of minor forest produce endowed to gram sabhas in scheduled areas has improved people's food security. Further, the imminent adverse impact on eco-services due to relaxations in penal provisions related to forest fires, grazing, and biodiversity conservation; along with the amendments in 2012 and 2023 to the Forest Rights Rules 2008 and the Forest Conservation Act 1980 respectively cannot be over-emphasized.

The agro-ecological connection between forest conservation and agriculture is crucial in a monsoon country like India. Along with the recent emphasis on millet, it's equally vital to include forest-derived foods and vegetables on our dietary platter. Providing free food grains to about 81 crore poor and vulnerable people for five years from January 2024, aimed at strengthening food accessibility, affordability, and availability, highlights the urgency of seeking better and sustainable solutions.

Increasing agricultural production by increasing the area under agriculture would come at the expense of natural ecosystems. The United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Report 2017 highlighted sustainable forestry as a crucial element of sustainable food systems. It strongly suggested a paradigm shift towards agroforestry, which integrates the management of trees, crops, and livestock. This holistic approach, combined with forest conservation, can bolster the long-term resilience of our food systems. Regardless of the political scenario, however, comprehensive studies may reveal the ground truth, including the intriguing trade-offs between land sharing and land sparing for forests in addressing food security. Research institutions of Forestry, Tribal, Rural Development, and Agriculture must converge and prioritize research on this crucial aspect of land use.

Further, stricter laws addressing sustainability with better implementation, good governance, preservation of gene pool, responsible behaviour of forest right holders, empowerment of farmers, closer coordination amongst stakeholder departments, and people's active participation in institutionalizing conservation-oriented processes across related sectors are necessary to find practical solutions to achieve food security.

The road to achieving SDG2 of zero hunger by 2030 is also fraught with challenges. Further research into various aspects such as the adoption of climate-friendly technologies and a climate-smart approach coupled with convincing advocacy efforts are needed to ensure that forests and biodiversity conservation remain on the agenda of policymakers and practitioners. The complex interplay between forest conservation, agriculture, and food security paints a compelling picture of our shared responsibility to foster a sustainable and resilient ecosystem; one that can ensure food security for all, now and in the future.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's newly appointed foreign minister Ishaq Dar said on Saturday Pakistani business community was interested in the resumption of trade with India and the government would examine the possibility by holding consultations with all stakeholders over the issue.

Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended bilateral trade with India after New Delhi's revocation of the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. The move escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with the administration in Islamabad describing the decision as a violation of the disputed region's autonomy that would create further instability in the neighborhood.

The broader geopolitical rift between the two countries impacted businesses on both sides who previously benefited from cross-border commerce in goods like textiles, agricultural products and medical supplies.

""India took extreme steps in August 2019 by making a constitutional and legal amendment that was very painful,"" the Pakistani minister said during a media interaction in London. ""There are UN Security Council resolutions [over the Kashmir issue] and the dispute lingers.""

""But I believe the Pakistani business community has been making this appeal and demand [to resume trade with India],"" he continued.

Dar said the issue came up for discussion during his consultations with them before he presented the budget as the finance minister last year.

""They all pointed out that imports are still continuing via Dubai and Singapore with extra freight and transportation costs,"" he added. ""So, we will seriously examine this. All stakeholders will sit together and see, at least to the extent of economic activities and trade, what can be done.""

However, he pointed out any decision related to the issue would require consultation.

""You can't change your neighbors,"" he said. ""Keep that in mind ... We have to coexist with them.""",arab.news,news,Arab News,,-0.003921568627450966,448926500,1,https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/03/23/4287646-151028614.jpg?itok=kEBEgy-S,

Eisenhower aircraft carrier struck three underground storage facilities in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen late Friday, according to a U.S. official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation not yet made public, said the ship is in the Red Sea.

Strikes and explosions were seen and heard in Sanaa on Friday night, according to witnesses and videos, some circulating on social media. Footage showed explosions and smoke rising over the Houthi-controlled capital.

There was no official confirmation of the injured or the origin of the explosions. Yemeni TV station Al-Masirah, which is linked to the Houthis, reported strikes hitting the city.

In a statement late Friday, U.S. Central Command said its forces also destroyed four unmanned aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

Central Command also said Houthis fired four anti-ship ballistic missiles toward the Red Sea, but no injuries or damage were reported by U.S., coalition or commercial ships.

Yemen's Houthi rebels, which are allied with Iran and control much of the country's north and west, have launched a campaign of drone and missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The Houthis have kept up their campaign of attacks despite two months of U.S.-led airstrikes.

It means you have opened the gates and entered our beloved home and there is a reason why we have kept this place special for you. You are family.

As I sit down to write this reflective blog in the form of a personal letter, I have thought deeply about the incredible journey we have embarked on. My heart swells with pride, love and gratitude for each of you who have stood by us in this fight for climate justice. Our journey to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been a steady path of determination, perseverance and unwavering solidarity. And incredibly hard work.

It all started with a small group of young law students in the Pacific, now known as The Pacific Island students fighting climate change who were fueled by a deep sense of duty to our people and our planet. Together with the Government of Vanuatu and a handful of civil society organisations, including Greenpeace, we dared to dream of holding the world's biggest polluters accountable for the devastating impacts of climate change on our beloved Pacific Islands and all nations that are in vulnerable situations due to climate. emergency all over the world.

We knew that our voices alone would not be enough to bring about the change we so desperately needed. So we mobilized. We mobilized our communities, our youth, our elders and our allies around the globe. From the bustling streets of New York to the remote atolls of Tuvalu, from the mountains of Papua New Guinea to the chaotic UNFCCC conferences, we marched hand in hand - singing, chanting, negotiating and shouting for climate action .

We sailed ours wake (sailing ships) and canoes, led by the inspiring leadership of young students, at the United Nations General Assembly, carrying with them the hopes and dreams of millions of people who could not be there in person, but were with us in the depths . Manna (soul).

Together, we reclaimed our peace wake in a symbol of hope, unity and endurance just as our ancestors did when they sailed across the continents and the vast Pacific Ocean to build a future for the generations that will carry on their legacy. A future based on the principles of love for simple (earth) and the deepest connection with moan (ocean).

We showed the world that the fight against climate change knows no borders and that we are all in this together, sailing towards a shared future of sustainability and harmony with nature. What began as a Pacific campaign is now a truly global movement.

For us, it wasn't just for our Pacific Vulture.

It was about young people who were unable to connect with their ancestral land because the spiritual soil had been eroded.

It was about families having to retrieve the remains of their loved ones from shore as rising seas uproot graves and sweep away their dignified resting place.

It was about the pregnant woman who traveled over 10 km to get water for her family after nearby water sources were polluted by extractive industries and lost her life and child in the process.

It was about the inspirational elderly women who have taken their government to the European Court of Human Rights after heatwaves threatened their right to life.

This war was for all of us.

Discovering the power of evidence to achieve climate justice

But our journey did not end there. We knew that to really make a difference, we needed more than just marches and speeches. We needed proof. Evidence that would speak louder than words and compel even the most powerful among us to listen.

So we embarked on a mission to collect evidence from the farthest corners of our planet. Evidence that would move you to tears, to anger, to admiration, to love. All kinds of emotions are experienced through the most resilient human beings on earth. We heard their stories of loss and resilience, of struggle and hope. And we knew we couldn't rest until their stories were heard.

We collected evidence to provide to states - all countries that were part of this climate fight - to help with their submissions as well as to create our Greenpeace submission. Our submission included powerful stories from the Pacific, the Philippines, Norway, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland and the Caribbean and in due course we will share this with you as the lived realities of these powerful individuals and communities cannot live alone in a submission but must be seen by the whole world.

Australia advances - Goes to the ICJ

And now, after months of tireless advocacy and relentless pressure on world governments, we have achieved a monumental victory. The Australian government, led by minister Penny Wong, has pledged to submit to the ICJ. This is an important step forward and we applaud Minister Wong and her government for taking this bold and necessary action for our world Seal them.

But our work is far from over. We need to make sure our voices continue to be heard loud and clear. The Australian government has given no indication of what is in the pipeline. We kindly ask the Australian Government to ensure full transparency of the content of their submission and to acknowledge its historical responsibilities and contributions to the climate crisis. We urge them to work closely, in solidarity and sincere engagement with Pacific governments throughout this process, ensuring that our voices are at the forefront of the conversation. For this advisory opinion to truly protect the human rights of present and future generations, Australia must be a true ally and a true supporter.

What is expected next?

In the next phase, June 2024, states will have an opportunity to respond to other states' submissions and you will find obvious objectors. But we will not be deterred. We will continue to fight. The year-end hearings provide an opportunity to focus the voices of our communities on the ground, and we will not miss this opportunity.

As we look forward to the next steps in this historic journey, let us remember the resilience and determination that brought us to this point. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the incredible leadership of the Pacific Islander students fighting against climate change, the Vanuatu government and the proud people of the Pacific. Let us continue to stand together, united in our commitment to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

It's time for ours wake to enter the gates of the highest court of the world and break down the walls of legal barriers with love, compassion, endurance and the powerful energy of our people.

Thank you to each and every one of you who have been a part of this incredible journey so far. And we can't start the next phase without you. You will always have a beloved place in Pacific Vacations. Together, we will win.

Apple is reportedly in talks with the Chinese web giant to integrate its machine learning technology into iPhones sold in the Middle Kingdom, according to a Wall Street Journal. report Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Cupertino has explored integrating third-party models from Google (which, oddly enough, invented BERTE) and OpenAI in its iDevices to strengthen its AI ambitions. Doing so in China, at least, could face obstacles.

Last summer, Chinese authorities instituted rules requiring models to be reviewed by regulators before their public launch. This is probably about ensuring that safeguards are in place to prevent them from generating responses that are, uh, inconsistent with government policy.

Launching in early 2023, ERNIE is Baidu's attempt to create a large ChatGPT-like language model and, as we reported at the time, it is self-censoring. When asked about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the chatbot remained silent, while other political issues ranging from Tiananmen Square to the treatment of Uyghur minorities were roundly rejected.

Apple already uses Baidu as the default search engine on iPhones sold in China, so it's no surprise that Cupertino is considering expanding that relationship to include AI.

If Apple integrates ERNIE into its Chinese market devices, it would not be the first. Samsung already uses Baidu's ERNIE chatbot in Galaxy smartphones sold in China. In the rest of the world, the South Korean electronics giant is banking on Google's Gemini.

Until recently, Apple has largely avoided using the term AI in its marketing, preferring the term machine learning to describe features built into its smartphones, tablets, and Macs.

Apple's software already uses ML extensively, whether to process photographs, perform object detection or optical character recognition, or to suggest apps based on your usage habits. Most of these operations are performed on the device's built-in neural processing unit (NPU), whenever possible.

Meanwhile, outside the Apple bubble, we are inundated with ""AI"" PCs and smartphones. Intel, AMD and Qualcomm have all announced chips with built-in neural network accelerators to run advanced designs on personal devices rather than in the cloud.

Perhaps this is why Apple has started to adopt AI in its marketing. iGiant touted its recently launched MacBook Air M3 as ""the world's best consumer laptop for AI"" and highlighted the ability to run LLMs and streaming models locally on the machine ""with excellent performance"" .

However, it is currently unclear whether Apple intends to integrate LLMs into its operating system or integrate them using API calls to remote models. We think we might learn more about Apple's AI strategy at WWDC in June.",exbulletin.com,news,ExBulletin,,0.02745098039215677,448926254,1,https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/05/18/shutterstock_editorial_only_baidu_ernie_bot.jpg,eng-9417617

Evolution of Equipment

One of the most noticeable impacts of technology in the pickleball space is with innovation within the paddles themselves. Several years ago, pickleball was played with wooden paddles and eventually Nomex cores. Now, high-tech material like thermo-formed cores and T700 Carbon Fiber surfaces are the standard. Some of the most expensive pickleball paddles are made from Carbon Fiber. Many companies like Slam Dinks are investing heavily in R&D.

Software like AutoCAD has allowed manufacturers to further improve paddles. This allows them to create aerodynamic paddles with custom measurements and insanely good specs that is noticeable on the court.

Data-Driven Training

Wearable devices such as smartwatches have revolutionized how players train and improve their skills. Fitness trackers can provide valuable data on players' performance metrics like heart rate, steps taken, and calories burned during a game. This information can help players monitor their fitness stats and optimize their training routines for better performance in game.

Video analysis software has been used to allow players to record their matches and analyze their technique frame by frame. This identifies areas of improvement to help refine footwork, strokes, and overall strategy.

Virtual Coaching

With the rise of online platforms and training courses, pickleball players have more opportunities than ever to connect with other members, share tips and strategies, and learn from the pros. Virtual coaching sessions conducted via zoom enable players to receive personalized instruction from experienced coaches regardless of their location, creating a sense of community among players worldwide.

Looking Ahead

As pickleball continues to evolve it is fueled by technological advancements. The future of the sport will no doubt continue to advance and grow with new technologies emerging daily.. From cutting-edge equipment to data-driven training methods and online community building, technology is reshaping every aspect of the game.

The province announced Tuesday that the Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) is getting an update -- criteria about level of education, experience, and language skills are getting stricter for foreigners.

A masked man at the event took to the mic and said the provincial government is ""betraying"" the international student community.

""Some people may think they are local residents, some may think they're graduating before that. But I will say, (if) such an important policy can be changed twice in three days (it means) every policy they've published is unstable, insecure, and cannot be trusted,"" he said.

""If you keep silent today, then if the same thing happens to you, there will be no one fighting for (you).""

Another woman at the event spoke about the distress the policy change has had on the community. She said last year the policy promised master's graduates permanent residency based on their degrees and that's why she based her university choice and life on this policy.

""We trusted the consistency of policy, so we quit our jobs outside B.C., we declined offers from universities and companies outside B.C... we moved from Ontario, we moved from Quebec... to settle down in B.C.,"" she said.

""Our kids just got used to their new schools, we said goodbye to our friends and families, but what did we get for all the trust and belief in B.C.?""

The policy for international master students changed abruptly, and additional requirements were added, and she is no longer eligible for the PNP.

""That was not what they said when we arrived... If we could foresee the updates on Tuesday one or two years ago, we could've had a choice to not come to B.C.,"" she said.

""How could a so-called long-term policy change in one day?""

The protest was coupled with a pre-existing petition that called B.C.'s update a ""seismic shift that could adversely affect both present and prospective international post-graduates in British Columbia.""

The petition says that the policy change creates ""uncertainty and stress"" for international students.

""It diminishes the province's appeal to talented international students and potentially influences the academic and professional diversity and vibrancy that these students bring to British Columbia,"" the petition read.

""We also highlight a growing mistrust towards the British Columbia government among the international community... also question the reliability and predictability of governmental decisions.""

The petition says that individuals are left without a sense of security about living in B.C., and this decision could make the province less appealing to them.

""Over the long term, this could result in British Columbia losing its appeal to international talent, leading to a drain of skilled individuals,"" it said.

The petition urges the province to introduce a transition period or a ""grandfather clause"" for students currently enrolled or enrolled before December 2024 -- making PR more accessible, reassess and revoke the mandate for a one-year skilled job offer for applicants post-December 2024, and perform consultations with student organizations before enacting such changes to policies impacting immigration of international students.

Steak, by contrast, was all about the platform.

I attend conferences like KubeCon to discover particularly innovative vendors who are pushing the boundaries of their respective technologies. Since this is SiliconANGLE's seventh article covering this major open source conference, my goal was to highlight vendors I haven't talked to before.

Here we introduce six such innovators and one former customer whose recent acquisitions make them deserving of a spot on this exclusive list.

Next-generation observability with intelligent agents

Observability is all about data, and wherever you find data these days, you can find large-scale language models or LLMs, the technology behind generative AI.

Most observability vendors have implemented LLM into their solutions to provide a convenient natural language chat interface, but it's not particularly innovative.

In contrast, Robusta Dev Ltd. uses LLM to implement observability-based intelligent agents. It is an autonomous software that can not only uncover the root cause of operational problems, but also take actions to remediate them.

Robust agents work on tasks iteratively and dynamically adjust as data changes. As a result, Robusta is particularly suited to solving dynamic cloud-native deployment problems.

In-house developer platform: two extremes

Platform engineering was a hot topic at KubeCon, second only to Buzz Meter's AI. Vendors use in-house developer platforms to support enterprise platform engineering efforts. However, the actual IDP products offered vary widely by vendor.

The central question is: How much input should the proposed IDP have? Is it better to let the customer decide how best to build and use the IDP, or should the IDP vendor share best practices with the platform? Is it better to infiltrate it?

An extreme example is MIA srl, also known as Mia-Platform. Mia-Platform provides a platform for building IDPs and allows Mia-Platform engineers to choose from a number of open source and commercial tools when building their own IDPs.

Second, Mia focuses on providing a consistent user interface and streamlining the developer experience throughout the software lifecycle. Mias' flexibility allows platform engineering teams to incorporate legacy tools as they modernize their infrastructure to cloud native.

At the other end of the spectrum is Kapeta Inc. Kapeta sells its own pre-built IDP for rapid deployment. Considering that other IDPs take years to implement, this highly opinionated approach has clear advantages. Unlike less opinionated products, Kapeta accelerates time to value.

Once platform engineers deploy the Kapeta platform, they can tune the tools they connect to through the Kapeta plugin architecture. In this way, Kapeta is able to balance the value of an IDP with a unique voice and the flexibility needed to tailor it to customer needs.

Enterprise Kubernetes Platform for Days 0, 1, and 2

Day 0 refers to the planning stage of a cloud-native infrastructure deployment. Considering the complexity of the Kubernetes ecosystem, even planning an attack can be a daunting task.

Day 1 refers to the initial deployment of Kubernetes and all associated add-ons, and day 2 refers to the full operation of multiple Kubernetes clusters, often in a hybrid multicloud environment.

Few vendors, other than those that have been in the market for a long time, have the wherewithal to support all three days. But DaoCloud Network Technology Co. Ltd. is in the deep end.

DaoCloud provides a layered enterprise Kubernetes platform solution. Provides a Day 0 platform that adds app store and application delivery capabilities to a cloud-native Community Edition foundation. These features include CI/CD pipelines and GitOps support.

In addition to this Day 0 offering, DaoClouds' advanced offerings add governance and observability for microservices. Full Enterprise Premium Edition is built on multicloud orchestration and real-time data services.

The result is an end-to-end cloud-native platform that can meet the needs of the most complex enterprise scenarios.

Next-generation API platform featuring GraphQL support

Previous generations of application programming interface gateways and management platforms handled API security and availability separately, leaving it up to the developers of the consuming applications to decide which APIs to access and when.

The current generation leverages the power of GraphQL to combine APIs and connect them to data graphs, allowing front-end developers to specify the data they need rather than a specific API.

Tyk Technologies Ltd. provides a universal data graph that integrates multiple APIs into a single GraphQL API endpoint. Tyk provides both an API gateway and a developer portal, leveraging an all-open source technology base to deliver high-performance API functionality.

Apollo Graph Inc. leverages GraphQL to implement API combinations like JOIN. It provides a query planner that operates in a manner similar to traditional relational database SQL interpreters, allowing developers to build business-centric APIs that abstract away the underlying application endpoints.

With this abstraction, Apollo gives front-end developers the ability to maintain the business context of the underlying data without having to deal with back-end API protocols and parameters.

An environment-centric approach to the Kubernetes application lifecycle

I worked briefly at Octopus Deploy Pty. Ltd. in its early days, and the company has grown so much over the last few years that it deserves to be featured in this article.

The latest vendor news is the acquisition of CodeFresh, Inc., a leading CI/CD platform provider and champion of the popular Argo open source CD tool.

Octopus Deploy puts CI/CD in the context of separate environments such as development, staging, and production. Each of these environments consists of elements in different clouds and may include different infrastructure components and Kubernetes clusters.

All of these details are abstracted away, allowing developers and DevOps engineers to move workloads from one environment to another without worrying about tedious details. Octopus also makes it very easy to roll back to a previous environment.

Octopus supports other environments in other situations, such as edge computing. At the edge, companies can define specific environments by geography (push this code to California) or business context (push this code to all refineries).

Kubernetes has crossed the chasm

Management thought leader Jeffrey Moore famously described the gulf between the early adopters of a particular technology and the initial majority of users. Early adopters are willing to experiment with immature technologies to gain the benefits of early movers. In contrast, the early majority just wants to get their work done.

KubeCon's 12,000+ audience was generally more interested in solving business problems than worrying about being a first mover. This is a clear sign that Kubernetes (and the more mature components of its ecosystem) is reaching early majority status.

For innovators like the vendors featured in this article, crossing this chasm raises the bar. Your product must clearly address a perceived company challenge or buyers won't bite. Let's get down to business.

""I know that from three years of working in measurement and data analytics that sleep is losing and consumption is winning,"" he says. The analytics reference speaks to his time as Chief Growth Officer & President at Nielsen, which followed a stint as President of Pawn Stars prodco Wheelhouse, and before that, 15 years at A+E.

Cohan is in New York when he speaks to Deadline - his first interview since joining Bell Media as President last November - but is about to up sticks and relocate to Toronto.

More from Deadline

He isn't a poker player but quizzed about content spending at Bell Media at a moment when many are reining in costs, he says the company is ""pot committed."" Asked about how the business will evolve in the next year and he says the company will ""put a couple more chips on the table.""

The cards he holds at Bell Media include the CTV broadcast network, French-language service Noovo, sports nets TSN and RDS, a raft of specialty channels, a sizeable advertising business, radio stations, and the local streamer Crave.

""There's what people would consider legacy pieces in that mix and a bunch of very future-facing properties,"" Cohan says. ""The challenge is taking these unique beloved brands, this great content and the strong people we have, and pointing them at a future where people are watching as much or more video than they were yesterday. It's like being a storyteller that still informs, still entertains, still delights and provokes... but doing that across a range of different platforms.""

Companies with legacy assets in North America and beyond are weathering harsh market conditions and that has led to cutbacks. Bell is no different, recently announcing its biggest layoffs in almost 30 years. Two rounds of cuts included layoffs at the Media division, which has a headcount of about 5,000, irking politicians who had allowed consolidation with the expectation of continued investment, notably in news.

""I don't think there's anyone in media, tech or telecoms that hasn't done some things, so restructuring has been an unfortunate necessity given the economic, and at times, the regulatory climate,"" says Cohan. ""I can say it's not chaos -- the sky isn't falling in. I can't promise that there's not more change in the ecosystem, but I would say that we've done what we have had to do, and for now, it's like let's get on with it.""

On regulation, the controversial Online Streaming Act is aiming to bring SVODs and digital platforms more into line with traditional media, though the levy that will dictate how much the likes of Netflix will be forced to pay on local content hasn't been set. The Bell Media President is grateful for the efforts to extend oversight to the streamers but says ""the legislation hasn't moved fast enough, nor has it gone far enough to deliver a level playing field,"" echoing several other senior leaders in Canadian media.

His own company has to adapt and transform to the new world he says, but calls for ""more attention to the some of the acute challenges that we're seeing.""

Growing its own streaming service is a priority for Bell Media. Crave has inked a programming deal with Fox, has greenlit multiple originals, and is now offered directly to Prime Video subscribers, and 2024 will be a growth year for Crave, says Cohan. ""Some of that is optimizing content, increasing penetration in places where it's under penetrated,"" he adds, noting that is part of a plan to embed Crave as well as other Bell Media channels and services more deeply in the digital world: ""You'll see all of our assets and brands and content being more ubiquitous across the digital landscape.""

In line with market trends, the next move is free ad-support channels. ""We'll launch FAST channels pretty darn soon,"" the Bell Media boss says.

Drilling down on advertising, Cohan says the market is not shrinking, but requirements are changing. ""We're well positioned because if you want out of home, you want digital, you want audio, you want video you want you know, alternate Thursdays with the blue moon? We've got it,"" he says. ""We've invested in new capabilities... that allow us to rock up to advertisers and say: 'What's the audience you want? We'll deliver it and we'll show you how it works'.""

At A+E, Cohan launched channels and programming around the world and taking more Canadian content out globally is another goal in his new gig. ""There's certainly the talent locally, there is certainly the scale, and there is the investment to do this. Then there is Canada's history as a co-producer and collaborator.""

The industry will add close to 10 million new jobs globally over the next seven years. Demand for workers is being driven by ongoing government and private-sector support for renewable energy, and firms are scrambling to find workers with the right skills.

""Energy companies around the world cite talent shortages and difficulty sourcing workers as one of their largest concerns about potential growth,"" writes Amy Horvat, SIA research analyst and author of the report.

Many renewable energy jobs require highly specialized or highly in-demand skills. Workers include those who design and operate renewable energy sites as well as those involved in their construction and the manufacturing of equipment.

The renewable energy space includes solar, wind power, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal energy and marine energy (i.e. tide and wave energy), according to the report.

Solar ranks as the top job generator. It accounted for 44% of all renewable energy jobs in 2023 and created nearly 75% of all new renewable energy jobs through 2030. Horvat noted solar usage is growing faster than other types of renewable energy, in part because it can be installed by individual consumers as well as on a utility sale.

The next biggest generator of renewable energy jobs was wind power, which is expected to create a further 15% of new jobs in the sector through 2030.

Where are the jobs located? China represents 33% of all renewable energy workers; however, the country is a relatively complex country in terms of temporary staffing. The countries with the next-largest renewable energy workforces include the US, Brazil and India.

""Of these, India is by far the most attractive because it continues to develop its utilities infrastructure to meet the modern needs of its large population, while the US is the least complex in terms of labor market restrictions,"" Horvat writes.

A number of staffing firms are already supplying workers in this space and are listed in the report.

Their source of income was abruptly taken away when Caracas shuttered its maritime and air border with Curacao in 2019 in a diplomatic dispute. Reopened last year, the market is slowly coming back to life, and the Corderos' hopes with it.

""The reopening was very good news for everyone, for Venezuelans and Curacaoans, as it is a source of revenue for everyone,"" said 32-year-old Rene Cordero, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather all sold goods at the market. His dad, Ramon, first traveled to the autonomous Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao when he was 16, with his father. Caracas halted air and sea travel to Curacao amid an international spat following the 2018 re-election of President Nicolas Maduro in elections widely denounced as neither free nor fair.

Curacao at the time received food and medicine sent by the United States as ""humanitarian aid"" requested by opposition leader Juan Guaido, then recognized as Venezuela's de facto leader by the White House in a failed bid to displace Maduro.

In April last year, the governments of both nations agreed to reopen the borders, and with it the market that has been there since 1918. Its stands have always been run by Venezuelans who stay in Willemstad, the island's capital, for about two months at a time before returning home, to be replaced by others. ""It was very hard,"" said Cordero of the closure of the market which is on land but described as ""floating"" because its vendors all arrive on small boats that are moored next to their stands.

In the time it was closed, Rene and his father tried to make it to the United States in search of an alternative income. After crossing seven countries, however, they were forced to return to Venezuela because of a tightening of US immigration policy. Once rich, Venezuela's economy is in dire straits, with GDP plummeting by 80 percent in a decade, forcing more than seven million to emigrate.

Between 2010 and 2019, Venezuela and the three islands of the neighboring archipelago of Curacao, Aruba and Bonaire, had an average commercial exchange of between $200 million and $300 million per year. Much of the vendors' income comes from passing cruise ships.

Last year, Curacao with its turquoise waters welcomed more than 500,000 visitors, according to the tourist office of the island of 150,000 inhabitants.

The sun is not up yet as Rene Cordero sets up his stall. It is an eight-hour journey to Curacao on the family's boat: the Francisca I, from La Vela de Coro in northern Venezuela. ""The prices here are better than at the supermarket, and everything is fresh,"" said local customer Carlos Veris. Yet, the market is not quite back to what it once was.

Of the thirty or so small Venezuelan boats that used to supply the market by sea, only six continue to make the trip today. A plaque put up in 2007 by the Willemstad oil refinery, celebrates the market as ""a symbol of more than a century of brotherhood of two neighboring peoples."" -- AFP",kuwaittimes.com,news,Kuwait Times,https,0.09019607843137245,448925458,1,https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/03/23/89300.jpg,

On February 8, 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a memorandum from the Quality, Safety & Oversight Group (QSOG) updating its 2018 guidance on texting patient information among healthcare providers in hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to permit the texting of patient orders among members of a patient's healthcare team if certain conditions are met.

In its 2018 guidance, CMS stated that texting patient orders from a provider to a member of the patient's care team would not be compliant with the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs). CMS noted particular concerns with record retention, privacy, confidentiality, security, and system integrity. Instead, CMS required that provider orders be either handwritten into the medical record or entered through the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) and then promptly placed into the medical record.

In updating the guidance, CMS notes that in 2018, most hospitals and CAHs did not have the ability to use secure texting platforms to incorporate orders into the medical record. CMS stated that though CPOE remains the agency's preferred method of order entry, suitable alternatives exist, and noted that there have been significant improvements in encryption and application programming interface (API) capabilities of texting platforms to transfer data into electronic health records (EHR).

In light of this, CMS determined that healthcare providers in hospitals and CAHs can text patient orders if accomplished through a HIPAA compliant, secure texting platform (STP) and in compliance with the CoPs. CMS stated it expects providers choosing to incorporate texting of patient information and orders into their EHR will use platforms that meet the requirements of the CoPs, the HIPAA Security Rule, and also the 2021 amendment to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Amendment 2021).

The hospital and CAH CoPs on medical records require, among other things, that medical inpatient and outpatient medical records be ""accurately written, promptly completed, properly filed and retained, and accessible."" Also, the hospital must use a system of author identification and record maintenance that ensures the integrity of the authentication and protects the security of all record entries. The CMS memorandum specifies: ""To comply with the CoPs, all providers must utilize and maintain systems/platforms that are secure and encrypted and must ensure the integrity of author identification as well as minimize the risks to patient privacy and confidentiality, as per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations.""

CMS further notes that providers using STPs should implement procedures/processes that routinely assess the security and integrity of the system or platform ""to avoid negative outcomes that could compromise the care of patients.""

Liu, Purdue University

Small-scale solar power, also known as rooftop or distributed solar, has grown considerably in the U.S. over the past decade. It provides electricity without emitting air pollutants or climate-warming greenhouse gases, and it meets local energy demand without requiring costly investments in transmission and distribution systems.

However, its expansion is making it harder for electric utilities and power grid managers to design fair and efficient retail electricity rates - the prices that households pay.

Under traditional electricity pricing, customers pay one charge per kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption that covers both the energy they use and the fixed costs of maintaining the grid. As more people adopt rooftop solar, they buy less energy from the grid. Fewer customers are left to shoulder utilities' fixed costs, potentially making power more expensive for everyone.

This trend can drive more customers to leave the system and raise prices further - a scenario known as the utility death spiral. One 2018 study calculated that two-thirds of recent electricity distribution cost increases at California's three investor-owned utilities were associated with the growth of residential solar.

With abundant sun and solar-friendly policies, California has 36% of U.S. small-scale solar capacity, much more than any other state. And the state is engaged in a heated debate over pricing electricity in ways designed to make energy less expensive for low-income households.

We study energy markets and public policy affecting energy and the environment, and have analyzed various retail electricity rate structures and their economic impacts on power producers and consumers. Our key finding is that an income-based, fixed-charge rate structure of the type that California is currently considering offers the most efficient and equitable solution - if it is designed correctly.

The debate over fixed charges began in 2022, when the California Legislature enacted an energy bill that ordered state regulators to study income-based fixed charges and decide whether to adopt them by July 1, 2024. Then the state's three largest utilities - Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas & Electric - submitted a proposal to the state Public Utilities Commission in mid-2023 that would separate retail bills into two parts: a fixed charge and a variable charge.

The fixed charge would be a preset monthly fee, independent of energy usage but tied to income levels, so wealthier customers would pay a larger share of grid maintenance costs. The variable charge would be based on the amount of electricity consumed and would cover the actual costs of electricity production and delivery.

Historically, these actual costs have typically ranged between 4 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Today, the average residential rate in California often exceeds 30 cents per kilowatt-hour because it covers fixed costs as well as electricity use.

A two-part billing system that separates fixed costs from variable usage charges offers potential benefits for both consumers and utilities.

For utilities, the fixed charge offers a stable revenue stream. The companies know how many households they serve, and they can plan on the fixed amounts that those households will pay each month. Households that go solar would still pay the fixed charge, since most of them draw electricity from the grid when the sun doesn't shine.

This approach provides financial stability for the utility and access to the grid for all. Consumers would benefit because with a certain amount of income guaranteed, utilities could charge significantly less per kilowatt-hour for the actual electricity that households use.

One significant concern is that if electricity costs less, people may use more of it, which could undermine efforts toward energy conservation and lead to an increase in emissions. In our view, the way to address this risk is by fine-tuning the two-part billing structure so that it covers only a portion of the utilities' costs through fixed charges and incorporates the rest into the variable usage rates.

Put another way, combining a lower fixed charge with a higher variable charge would ensure that utilities can still cover their fixed costs effectively, while encouraging mindful energy use among consumers. Ensuring affordable electricity for consumers, fair cost recovery for utilities and overall fairness and efficiency in the energy market requires striking a delicate balance.

Another argument from critics, often labeled ""energy socialism,"" asserts that higher-income households might end up subsidizing excessive electricity use by lower-income households under the income-based rate structure. In our view, this perception is inaccurate.

Wealthy households would pay more to maintain the grid, via larger fixed charges, than poorer households, but would not subsidize lower-income households' energy use. All income groups would pay the same rate for each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity that they use. Decisions on energy use would remain economically driven, regardless of consumers' income level.

While our research supports California utilities' approach in principle, we believe their proposal has shortcomings - notably in the proposed income brackets.

As currently framed, households with annual incomes between US$28,000 and $69,000 would pay a fixed fee of $20 to $34 per month. Households earning between $69,000 and $180,000 would pay $51 to $73 per month, and those earning more than $180,000 would pay $85 to $128.

The middle-income bracket starts just above California's median household income. Consequently, nearly half of all California households could find themselves paying a substantial monthly fee - $51 to $73 - regardless of their actual electricity usage.

It could be hard to convince consumers to pay significant fixed fees for intangible services, especially middle-income residents who have either gone solar or may do so. Not surprisingly, the proposal has encountered considerable pushback from the solar industry.

In response to public outcry, California lawmakers recently introduced Assembly Bill 1999, which would replace the income-graduated fixed-charge requirement with fixed charges of $5 per month for low-income customers and up to $10 per month for others. In our view, this reaction goes too far in the other direction.

Capping fixed charges at such low levels would force utilities to hike their energy use rates to cover fixed costs - again, risking the death spiral scenario. Our research indicates that there is a range for the fixed charge that would cover a reasonable share of utilities' fixed costs, but is not high enough to burden consumers.

Without utility cost data, we can't pinpoint this range precisely. However, based on estimates of utilities' costs, we believe the caps proposed in AB 1999 are too low and could end up unfairly burdening those the bill aims to protect.

In our research, based on a hypothetical case study, we found a sweet spot in which fixed charges cover about 40% of utilities' fixed costs. Charges at this level provide maximum benefit to consumers, although they reduce energy producers' profits.

Our findings are similar to an alternative proposal jointly presented by The Utility Reform Network, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This plan suggests a two-part rate structure with an average fixed charge of about $36 per month. Low-income households would pay $5 per month, and those earning over $150,000 yearly would pay about $62.

We believe this proposal moves in the right direction by ensuring fair contributions to grid costs, while also encouraging efficient energy use and investment in clean energy infrastructure. It could act as a guide for other U.S. states searching for methods to balance utility fixed-cost recovery with fair pricing and continued growth of small-scale solar power.

""I know that from three years of working in measurement and data analytics that sleep is losing and consumption is winning,"" he says. The analytics reference speaks to his time as Chief Growth Officer & President at Nielsen, which followed a stint as President of Pawn Stars prodco Wheelhouse, and before that, 15 years at A+E.

Cohan is in New York when he speaks to Deadline - his first interview since joining Bell Media as President last November - but is about to up sticks and relocate to Toronto.

More from Deadline

He isn't a poker player but quizzed about content spending at Bell Media at a moment when many are reining in costs, he says the company is ""pot committed."" Asked about how the business will evolve in the next year and he says the company will ""put a couple more chips on the table.""

The cards he holds at Bell Media include the CTV broadcast network, French-language service Noovo, sports nets TSN and RDS, a raft of specialty channels, a sizeable advertising business, radio stations, and the local streamer Crave.

""There's what people would consider legacy pieces in that mix and a bunch of very future-facing properties,"" Cohan says. ""The challenge is taking these unique beloved brands, this great content and the strong people we have, and pointing them at a future where people are watching as much or more video than they were yesterday. It's like being a storyteller that still informs, still entertains, still delights and provokes... but doing that across a range of different platforms.""

Companies with legacy assets in North America and beyond are weathering harsh market conditions and that has led to cutbacks. Bell is no different, recently announcing its biggest layoffs in almost 30 years. Two rounds of cuts included layoffs at the Media division, which has a headcount of about 5,000, irking politicians who had allowed consolidation with the expectation of continued investment, notably in news.

""I don't think there's anyone in media, tech or telecoms that hasn't done some things, so restructuring has been an unfortunate necessity given the economic, and at times, the regulatory climate,"" says Cohan. ""I can say it's not chaos -- the sky isn't falling in. I can't promise that there's not more change in the ecosystem, but I would say that we've done what we have had to do, and for now, it's like let's get on with it.""

On regulation, the controversial Online Streaming Act is aiming to bring SVODs and digital platforms more into line with traditional media, though the levy that will dictate how much the likes of Netflix will be forced to pay on local content hasn't been set. The Bell Media President is grateful for the efforts to extend oversight to the streamers but says ""the legislation hasn't moved fast enough, nor has it gone far enough to deliver a level playing field,"" echoing several other senior leaders in Canadian media.

His own company has to adapt and transform to the new world he says, but calls for ""more attention to the some of the acute challenges that we're seeing.""

Growing its own streaming service is a priority for Bell Media. Crave has inked a programming deal with Fox, has greenlit multiple originals, and is now offered directly to Prime Video subscribers, and 2024 will be a growth year for Crave, says Cohan. ""Some of that is optimizing content, increasing penetration in places where it's under penetrated,"" he adds, noting that is part of a plan to embed Crave as well as other Bell Media channels and services more deeply in the digital world: ""You'll see all of our assets and brands and content being more ubiquitous across the digital landscape.""

In line with market trends, the next move is free ad-support channels. ""We'll launch FAST channels pretty darn soon,"" the Bell Media boss says.

Drilling down on advertising, Cohan says the market is not shrinking, but requirements are changing. ""We're well positioned because if you want out of home, you want digital, you want audio, you want video you want you know, alternate Thursdays with the blue moon? We've got it,"" he says. ""We've invested in new capabilities... that allow us to rock up to advertisers and say: 'What's the audience you want? We'll deliver it and we'll show you how it works'.""

At A+E, Cohan launched channels and programming around the world and taking more Canadian content out globally is another goal in his new gig. ""There's certainly the talent locally, there is certainly the scale, and there is the investment to do this. Then there is Canada's history as a co-producer and collaborator.""

A total of 46 MEPs voted against the AIA while another 49 abstained.

In a statement following the bill's passage, Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the internal market, proudly wrote on X that Europe ""is NOW a global standard-setter in AI.""

What the AIA does is divide artificial intelligence (AI) technology into numerous categories based on risk. The risk categories range from ""unacceptable,"" meaning an intended AI use or application is to be banned because it is too dangerous, as well as from high to medium to low hazard.

Certain AI applications that are deemed to threaten the rights of EU citizens, one example being biometric categorization systems based on sensitive personal characteristics or facial recognition scrapings from the internet or CCTV, will not be allowed under the bill.

Other AI uses that are forbidden under the EU's AIA legislation include:

* Emotion recognition at workplaces and in schools

* Social scoring

* Predictive policing, which involves profiling potential suspects based solely on certain characteristics

Another thing the AIA legislation forbids is the use of biometric identification systems, known as RBI, by law enforcement, except in very narrowly defined circumstances and situations. Only when strict safeguards are met will so-called ""real-time"" RBI ever be allowed by AI applications.

""We finally have the world's first binding law on artificial intelligence to reduce risks, create opportunities, combat discrimination, and bring transparency,"" celebrated Brando Benifei, co-rapporteur of the Internal Market Committee, at a plenary debate on the legislation.

Benifei added in a statement that all unacceptable AI practices, as defined by the EU, are now explicitly banned across the European bloc, while the rights of workers and citizens remain protected.

The AIA bill will officially come into force at the end of the legislative session in May after passing final checks and receiving official endorsement from the European Council.

The bill's passage comes at a time when concerns about AI abuse are rising all around the world. Some worry about the threat of AI ""deepfakes,"" as well as AI programs that are capable of creating false events, complete with fake photos and video footage.

Other countries including China and India are similarly trying to regulate AI through strict guidelines. The United States is further behind, though some states and local municipalities are passing their own respective bills to restrict AI use in certain situations such as hiring and police investigations.

""This legislation was probably made using AI because, considering the speeches and behaviors of European politicians, they would not have the capacity to regulate even a scientific calculator from the '70s!"" joked one commenter about the matter.

""The corporate globalist cabal could not care less about humanity or any harms they cause to it,"" noted another about how the AIA bill is simply a smokescreen. ""The corporate globalists will undoubtedly be using all forms of AI against We the People - they have already stolen our governments.""

This approach provides financial stability for the utility and access to the grid for all. Consumers would benefit because with a certain amount of income guaranteed, utilities could charge significantly less per kilowatt-hour for the actual electricity that households use.

One significant concern is that if electricity costs less, people may use more of it, which could undermine efforts toward energy conservation and lead to an increase in emissions. In our view, the way to address this risk is by fine-tuning the two-part billing structure so that it covers only a portion of the utilities' costs through fixed charges and incorporates the rest into the variable usage rates.

Put another way, combining a lower fixed charge with a higher variable charge would ensure that utilities can still cover their fixed costs effectively, while encouraging mindful energy use among consumers. Ensuring affordable electricity for consumers, fair cost recovery for utilities and overall fairness and efficiency in the energy market requires striking a delicate balance.

Another argument from critics, often labeled ""energy socialism,"" asserts that higher-income households might end up subsidizing excessive electricity use by lower-income households under the income-based rate structure. In our view, this perception is inaccurate.

Wealthy households would pay more to maintain the grid, via larger fixed charges, than poorer households, but would not subsidize lower-income households' energy use. All income groups would pay the same rate for each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity that they use. Decisions on energy use would remain economically driven, regardless of consumers' income level.

While our research supports California utilities' approach in principle, we believe their proposal has shortcomings - notably in the proposed income brackets.

As currently framed, households with annual incomes between US$28,000 and $69,000 would pay a fixed fee of $20 to $34 per month. Households earning between $69,000 and $180,000 would pay $51 to $73 per month, and those earning more than $180,000 would pay $85 to $128.

The middle-income bracket starts just above California's median household income. Consequently, nearly half of all California households could find themselves paying a substantial monthly fee - $51 to $73 - regardless of their actual electricity usage.

It could be hard to convince consumers to pay significant fixed fees for intangible services, especially middle-income residents who have either gone solar or may do so. Not surprisingly, the proposal has encountered considerable pushback from the solar industry.

In response to public outcry, California lawmakers recently introduced Assembly Bill 1999, which would replace the income-graduated fixed-charge requirement with fixed charges of $5 per month for low-income customers and up to $10 per month for others. In our view, this reaction goes too far in the other direction.

Capping fixed charges at such low levels would force utilities to hike their energy use rates to cover fixed costs - again, risking the death spiral scenario. Our research indicates that there is a range for the fixed charge that would cover a reasonable share of utilities' fixed costs, but is not high enough to burden consumers.

Without utility cost data, we can't pinpoint this range precisely. However, based on estimates of utilities' costs, we believe the caps proposed in AB 1999 are too low and could end up unfairly burdening those the bill aims to protect.

In our research, based on a hypothetical case study, we found a sweet spot in which fixed charges cover about 40% of utilities' fixed costs. Charges at this level provide maximum benefit to consumers, although they reduce energy producers' profits.

Our findings are similar to an alternative proposal jointly presented by The Utility Reform Network, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This plan suggests a two-part rate structure with an average fixed charge of about $36 per month. Low-income households would pay $5 per month, and those earning over $150,000 yearly would pay about $62.

We believe this proposal moves in the right direction by ensuring fair contributions to grid costs, while also encouraging efficient energy use and investment in clean energy infrastructure. It could act as a guide for other U.S. states searching for methods to balance utility fixed-cost recovery with fair pricing and continued growth of small-scale solar power.

Filed on March 21 in a New Jersey federal court, and supported by 16 state attorney generals, the lawsuit claims that Apple maintains a monopolistic position in the smartphone market.

This, the DOJ contends, allows Apple to coerce developers into exclusively using its payment system, thereby locking in developers and users to its platform.

Central to the DOJ's accusations are Apple's App Store guidelines and developer agreements, which are criticized for their complex and variable rules.

These restrictions, according to the DOJ, enable Apple to charge excessive fees, hinder innovation, compromise user experience security, and limit competitive alternatives.

The lawsuit suggests that such practices notably restrict the functionality of crypto-based apps on iOS devices, impacting competition not only in the smartphone sector but also in financial services and other industries.

The DOJ specifically criticizes Apple for excluding alternative payment systems in a manner deemed anticompetitive and exclusionary.

Highlighting the controversial 30% commission, often referred to as the ""Apple tax"" on apps and in-app purchases, the complaint outlines how this policy and Apple's fiat-only payment systems effectively block the integration of cryptocurrencies into apps, rendering it economically unfeasible for crypto-based applications to offer in-app purchases.

Additionally, the complaint notes that while Apple permits certain customers to distribute apps through custom app stores, it restricts iPhone users and developers from accessing these alternatives.

This restriction aims to protect Apple's revenue from its App Store fees.

The DOJ accuses Apple of inconsistently enforcing its App Store rules to penalize developers leveraging technologies that could challenge Apple's market dominance.

Specific examples include the disabling of functionalities in nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces like OpenSea, and the social app Damus being forced to remove a Bitcoin tipping feature after Apple removed it from the App Store for circumventing its payment system.

Moreover, the DOJ alleges that Apple's control extends to web apps, as it mandates the use of its WebKit engine for all iOS web browsers, further restricting competition.

In defense, an Apple spokesperson refuted the DOJ's allegations, asserting the lawsuit is baseless and vowing to ""vigorously defend against it.""

Apple argues that the lawsuit threatens to give the government undue influence over technology design, potentially compromising user privacy and security.

This defense comes as Apple faces pressure from regulations like the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which mandates offering alternative browser engines and app stores, despite Apple's concerns for user safety.

Following the lawsuit's announcement, Apple's stock price dropped by 4% to around $171, with no significant recovery in after-hours trading, as reported by Google Finance.",cryptodaily.co.uk,news,cryptodaily.co.uk,,0.1137254901960785,448924917,1,,eng-9412444

(KGUN) -- Johnny Gibson's Downtown Market had a little extra help Wednesday March 20. It's all thanks to Sunnyside Unified School District's Adult Transition Center, or ATC.

The ATC helps young adults with disabilities transition into adulthood after high school by teaching them skills to help them live and work independently. Students can stay in this program until they turn 22 years old.

Three students went to Johnny Gibson's on this trip. They took the city bus downtown, navigating public transportation with the help of a printed map.

When they arrived, each student took on a different role: one as a line cook, one as a cashier and one as a baker.

Ren Watkins worked in the bakery section. He cut over 60 slices of cake and baked multiple batches of cookies under the guidance of Johnny Gibson's employee Christina Armenta-Jimenez.

She said that having Ren was a big help.

""Ren said he wants to come apply for a job next year over here and he wants to try for bakery,"" she said. ""He got the hang of it really fast. Once I showed him once, he took over. He knew what he was doing. I just put my hands up and I stood there and he ended up doing my job.""

Ren will be graduating from the program in May and told KGUN he hopes to work at Johnny Gibson's Downtown Market after.

Working with farmers and project developers, he brokers deals for one of the most hotly contested aspects of the energy transition - land.

The founder of Australia's first renewable energy land acquisition agency, Mr Moroko has secured four gigawatts of big batteries and 800 megawatts of solar farms over 30 individual agreements across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

His deals have so far reached $61 million, with some farmers getting almost double the value of back paddocks as Australia heads towards a mostly renewable-powered grid by 2030.

He says the sector is ""really, really booming"" as developers scramble to get their hands on big battery sites.

The landowner for a battery energy system being built on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula had to wait two-and-a-half years for approvals because of red tape but received almost double what his place is worth.

""The values can climb quite dramatically, which is really good for some people,"" Mr Moroko says.

""A lot of the time they can get 1.5 or double what their place is worth because it's a renewable energy development rather than someone just selling a vacant parcel.""

He also helps developers if an easement is needed through a neighbouring property but requirements for big transmission lines are government-run.

Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the renewable energy rollout as ""pure insanity"" and says no project should be above scrutiny ""especially when it involves prime agricultural land"".

He insists the bush is full and wants big solar restricted to large arrays on commercial buildings in Australia's cities.

But Mr Moroko knows farmers are giving up excess or marginal land, not prime grazing areas.

""In my experience, and I've done 30-plus deals, is that if it's really good grazing land, it's a 'no', because the money they get from grazing will be on a par if not higher than what they get for a solar farm,"" he says.

""If you've got excess land or back paddocks you don't use, you can get lease terms with a solar farm generating income every month for 20 or 30 years.""

There's ""huge demand"" as governments wake up to the fact they need multiple battery energy storage sites to capture abundant sunshine and release excess back into the grid to meet peak demand.

""Lots of people say 'no' they're not interested but then if their neighbour is keen, they're really interested so they're not left out,"" he says.

""They want to be the ones benefiting financially.""

They're happy to have a renewable energy project on land they can't see from their porch, he adds.

While big battery sites must be fenced off for safety reasons, sheep can graze through solar farms.

Farmers can also negotiate a pretty good deal for maintenance of solar projects, which is also beneficial to them and the community who provide the labour for above-market rates, Mr Moroko says.

Many farmers have big parcels of suitable land and make a million dollars a year leasing out 800 to a 1000 hectares while others can do the same with a smaller portion, even just 20 hectares, and still earn six figures.

Farmers for Climate Action polling across Central Queensland, NSW's Hunter and Illawarra found widespread support for renewables in the regions.

This followed a survey of farmers in December which found only one per cent saw transmission requirements as the top threat to their farm, while 55 per cent nominated climate change as the greatest threat to their farm.

""Income during drought is vital when you're trying to run a family farm and renewable energy delivers that,"" Farmers for Climate Action Chair Brett Hall says.

Typical payments being offered to farmers by wind companies are now more than $40,000 per turbine per year and many host dozens of turbines whilst still running sheep or cattle.

Asked about noise, one survey respondent said the only sound was the ""ka-ching"" of the cash register with every turn of the blade.

Solar companies are offering farmers around $1500 per hectare per year rent and they often continue to run sheep under the panels.

Mr Hall says the National Farmers Federation president makes money from wind turbines on his land and so does another previous NFF president.

But compulsory purchases by government remain controversial, including in the energy transition ""chokepoint"" of NSW.

Recent analysis by consultancy Green Energy Markets suggested the national target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 was already at risk.

The NSW government began public consultation on Friday on a review into improving compulsory land acquisition for infrastructure.

""We want to put people in the best position to understand their legal rights and ensure there are consistent and transparent acquisition processes across government,"" Minister for Lands and Property Steve Kamper says.

He says compulsory acquisitions are necessary at times to allow state infrastructure and other public projects to proceed for the benefit of the wider community.

""However, there are opportunities to improve processes which are being explored by this review to help landowners negotiate more effectively on their compensation.""

At his daily news briefing, the Mexican leader located his inaction to combat cartel violence within a ""Mexico First"" policy that doesn't answer to anyone else -- namely the U.S., Mexico's northern neighbor.

While explaining why he wouldn't directly crack down on the illegal drug trade, López Obrador said, ""We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government.""

""Mexico First. Our home comes first,"" he said.

The reasoning goes against the explanations López Obrador has offered in the past, when he claimed ""you cannot fight violence with violence"" as a reason for his inaction. He's offered the solution to cartel violence lies in curing social inequalities, like providing better access to economic opportunities.

His view isn't new or necessarily different from his predecessors.

""For decades, past administrations in Mexico have thought the war against drug cartels was basically a U.S. problem,"" security analyst David Saucedo told the Associated Press. Drug usage levels in Mexico are still relatively low.

""On the other hand, the drug cartels provide jobs in regions where the Mexican government can't provide economic development, they encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade and investment deficits,"" Saucedo added.

In the U.S., tens of thousands of people die each year from overdoses on synthetic opioids like fentanyl, usually from drugs manufactured in Mexico from chemicals originating in China. According to the CDC, more than 100,000 people died from synthetic opioid-related overdoses in 2021 and 2022 -- a number that has climbed every year.

Despite the progress made in recent years, these leaders are contending with regulatory confusion, unequal market access and a complex business environment.

A recent press conference in Beijing highlighted an urgent need for regulatory transparency to level the playing field. Suggested changes would encourage more European businesses to invest in China while invigorating current ones.

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) report in question, reveals the escalation of risks for foreign entities. These frustrations are further exacerbated by the fluctuating regulatory climate, additional financial risk, and an overall policy uncertainty.

While investor confidence among European firms is dwindling, China still presents an attractive market for many businesses. However, the need for comprehensive risk management is imperative in such an environment.

Jens Eskelund, President of the EUCCC, and Markus Herrmann Chen, Managing Director of China Macro Group, have underscored these issues. They identified roadblocks including legal complications and significant compliance requirements that make operation more difficult for foreign entities.

Both Eskelund and Chen stressed that a transparent and predictable regulatory environment is critical for fostering a healthy business climate in China.

Despite current challenges, they highlighted the potential for growth and requisite of a robust, China-specific strategy to navigate these uncertainties.

An appeal for EUCCC to play a central role was made with a strong suggestion for partnerships with local agencies. This aims to better understand the Chinese market and counter regulatory risks, thereby promoting a balanced business environment.

The EUCCC report vividly paints the challenges and unpredictability facing foreign entities in China. Stricter regulations, uneven playing fields, and uncertainty exacerbate such concerns. These businesses are encouraged to communicate actively with the relevant Chinese authorities and stay on top of regulatory changes to better navigate the market.

Eskelund and Chen offered further insights into the specific challenges, emphasizing issues such as murky regulations and potential corruption. However, they remained optimistic about the potential of the Chinese market for those businesses that successfully overcome the present hurdles.

The conference concluded with a marked unease about the future of international business in China.

When BTC recently shifted the entire market, everyone expected Dogecoin to at least break its ATH value of $0.7376, as recorded on May 8, 2021, the last bull period. However, the meme coin failed to meet investors' expectations and is still below the $1 mark.

Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday rebuked the calls of U.S. officials to crack down on the illegal drug trade, saying the U.S. opioid crisis caused by drugs funneled through Mexican cartels wasn't Mexico's problem to deal with.

At his daily news briefing, the Mexican leader located his inaction to combat cartel violence within a ""Mexico First"" policy that doesn't answer to anyone else -- namely the U.S., Mexico's northern neighbor.

While explaining why he wouldn't directly crack down on the illegal drug trade, López Obrador said, ""We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government.""

""Mexico First. Our home comes first,"" he said.

The reasoning goes against the explanations López Obrador has offered in the past, when he claimed ""you cannot fight violence with violence"" as a reason for his inaction. He's offered the solution to cartel violence lies in curing social inequalities, like providing better access to economic opportunities.

His view isn't new or necessarily different from his predecessors.

""For decades, past administrations in Mexico have thought the war against drug cartels was basically a U.S. problem,"" security analyst David Saucedo told the Associated Press. Drug usage levels in Mexico are still relatively low.

""On the other hand, the drug cartels provide jobs in regions where the Mexican government can't provide economic development, they encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade and investment deficits,"" Saucedo added.

In the U.S., tens of thousands of people die each year from overdoses on synthetic opioids like fentanyl, usually from drugs manufactured in Mexico from chemicals originating in China. According to the CDC, more than 100,000 people died from synthetic opioid-related overdoses in 2021 and 2022 -- a number that has climbed every year.",thedailybeast.com,news,The Daily Beast,,-0.2,448924050,1,"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2780,w_4942,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/f_auto,q_auto/v1711227113/GettyImages-1963637164_vh1aou",eng-9421620

This comes in the backdrop of major water crisis presently affecting several parts of India including Karnataka and the sweltering summer heat in Kerala itself.

The Samastha Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Qutbah (SKJQ), a feeder organisation of Samastha Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Ulama asked all khatibs (Religious speakers) to spread awareness on water conservation during Friday prayers, The New Indian Express reported.

Quoting the last prophet of Islam, Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), the SKJQ general secretary Nazar Faizi Koodathayi said, even if one is performing wuzu (ablution for prayers) from the water of flowing river, he shouldn't waste it.

The top religious organization in the state has urged believers to exercise care while performing ablution under a running tap, especially while moving from washing one organ to the other.

""It is advisable to depend on ablution tanks for wuzu when there is water shortage. After ablution, the water should be used for agriculture or other purposes,"" Faizi said.

He said supplying drinking water is a pious deed that will be rewarded in the hereafter.

""A person had asked the Prophet (PBUH) about how he could ensure heaven for his deceased mother. To which the holy Prophet replied that he should distribute drinking water among people,"" Faizi said.

Although plenty water is available in Kerala, he said creating awareness on saving water is imperative as climate changes are posing a threat to the water bodies.

""Decline in rainfall and depletion of groundwater are signs of an impending catastrophe,"" Faizi said.

'40% of sources polluted'

""Around 40% of our water sources are polluted. People should be made aware of such things and should be exhorted to prevent a disaster,"" Faizi said.

Faizi said the Quran had several verses that underlined the importance of water.

""Surah 23, verse 18 says, 'We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away.'

Similarly, Surah 67, verse 29 says, 'Did you even consider: if all the water that you have (in the wells) were to sink down into the depths of the earth, who will produce for you clear, flowing water?""",greaterkashmir.com,news,Greater Kashmir,,0.1764705882352942,448923226,1,https://www.greaterkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WATER-scaled.jpg,

Following the first two days of this year's March Madness picks, bettors poured more money on UConn to defend its national championship than any other team.

The early bets on the Huskies' second-round matchup with the No. 9 Northwestern Wildcats further suggest the world believes in Connecticut. However, that is not giving the Wildcats enough credit for advancing past FAU in the March Madness bracket.

UConn's rout of a 16-seed should not have inflated the spread against Northwestern in the March Madness odds, and our free college basketball picks will explain why as we preview Northwestern vs. UConn on Sunday, March 24.

Yes, Connecticut dominated every minute of its win against Stetson. Winning the first 10 minutes 23-4 showcased a defensive focus that would raise the Huskies' ceiling even further.

Give UConn credit for that....but remember who the Huskies faced.

The Huskies' title odds dropping since that win were not so much a reflection of their own performance, as it was the result of Auburn's loss to Yale. Without the Tigers awaiting in the Sweet Sixteen, UConn should have a clear path to the Elite Eight.

However, Northwestern could make things interesting on Sunday night.

If the officiating crew had not utterly botched two calls in the closing minutes of regulation, Northwestern probably would have upset FAU in regulation. Boo Buie had a transition bucket halted by a whistleblowing the play dead because a player was on the floor on the other end of the court. Following that, an errant and incorrect whistle in the final minute took possession away from the Wildcats.

Would folks be more impressed if Northwestern had won in regulation? Was this spread bet all the way up to +14.5 because the Wildcats so struggled in the first half? Frankly, a 39-point second half should have then inspired some belief.

Buie may be the best offensive player on the court on Sunday night, while Ryan Langborg has now starred in four tournament games across the last two years, his 27 points on Friday driving the Wildcats to their upset. Stetson's guards were hyped as a possible threat against UConn, yet Northwestern's are better and more tested.

The line movement towards the Huskies has been an extreme overexxageration, so we're fading the public on Sunday.

Langborg was not only the key to the Wildcats' win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament but is singlehandedly the reason the program reached March Madness in the first place. When point guard Ty Berry suffered a meniscus injury in early February, Langborg was the guy who stepped up the most.

In the 10 Big Ten games before Berry's injury, Langborg averaged 10.1 points and 2.1 assists while posting a usage rate north of 20% only three times. In Langborg's eight full games since then, he has boasted 16.8 points and 3.3 assists while posting a usage rate higher than 20% seven times.

Part of Langborg's hidden impact has been that by improving Northwestern's offense, its defense improved as well. The Wildcats prefer a slow pace, and it has gotten slower since Berry's injury, ranking No. 340 in the country. Made buckets force opponents to slow down.

Northwestern will want to emphasize that in Brooklyn, given UConn has more talent. Fewer possessions will reduce that gap's impact, and in that regard, Langborg's points prop is correlated to UConn's team total.

Learn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.

The first offerings on this game saw Northwestern as a 12.5-point underdog. Even that number was influenced by Friday's results, with advanced metrics suggesting this should be a 10-point spread.

Yet, by Friday night it had risen to +14.5 at some books, with most settling at +14.

The total did not move with that spread, opening at 135.5 and remaining there into Saturday. The lack of correlated movement to the spread suggests the betting public viewed the +12.5 as entirely mispriced.

The Wildcats have gone 8-3 against the spread since Berry's injury, including 5-1 as underdogs with three outright wins.

Everyone knows to look for phony emails -- they can appear in your email inbox or even at work.

Scammers can easily make messages that appear to come from anywhere, like your boss's email account or a close family member. But what about phone calls and voicemail?

Scammers can use new AI technology to mimic the voice of someone you know and create a phone call or voicemail recording.

This ""voice cloning"" technology has recently advanced, and anyone with the right software can clone a voice from a very small audio sample.

How the scam works

At work, you get a voicemail from your boss.

They instruct you to wire thousands of dollars to a vendor for a rush project. The request is out of the blue. But it's the boss's orders, so you make the transfer. A few hours later, you see your boss and confirm that you sent the payment.

But there's one big problem; your manager has no idea what you are talking about! It turns out that the message was fake.

At home, you may receive a phone call or voicemail from a family member in an urgent situation like an accident or a medical emergency.

They provide convincing details and ask for money immediately via a digital wallet payment app like Venmo or PayPal.

You find out later that the story wasn't true, and your money is gone.

A consumer recently shared on Scam Tracker, ""Received call on 1-26-24 I thought it was my daughter-in-law she said Hi mom calling to say she was pulled over driving and has a broken nose and is now being. She was frantic to have me call the lawyer right away. She asked me three times if I wrote the name and number down. I said yes. She said she had to go right now as they are taking her. Her voice sounded just like my daughter-in-law.""

Tip to avoid AI voice cloning scams

Resist the urge to act immediately

No matter how convincing a phone call or voicemail may sound, hang up or close the message if something doesn't feel right. Call the person who claimed to have called you directly with the phone number you have saved for them. Don't call back the number provided by the caller or caller ID. Ask questions that would be hard for an imposter to answer correctly.

Don't send money if you're in doubt

If the caller urgently asks you to send money via a digital wallet payment app or a gift card, that may be a red flag for a scam. If you wire money to someone and later realize it's a fraud, the police must be alerted.

Secure your accounts

Whether at work or home, set up multifactor authentication for email logins and other changes in email settings. At work, verify changes in information about customers, employees, or vendors.

At work, train your staff

Create a secure culture at your office by training employees in internet security. Make it a policy to confirm all change and payment requests before transferring.

Working with farmers and project developers, he brokers deals for one of the most hotly contested aspects of the energy transition - land.

The founder of Australia's first renewable energy land acquisition agency, Mr Moroko has secured four gigawatts of big batteries and 800 megawatts of solar farms over 30 individual agreements across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

His deals have so far reached $61 million, with some farmers getting almost double the value of back paddocks as Australia heads towards a mostly renewable-powered grid by 2030.

He says the sector is ""really, really booming"" as developers scramble to get their hands on big battery sites.

The landowner for a battery energy system being built on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula had to wait two-and-a-half years for approvals because of red tape but received almost double what his place is worth.

""The values can climb quite dramatically, which is really good for some people,"" Mr Moroko says.

""A lot of the time they can get 1.5 or double what their place is worth because it's a renewable energy development rather than someone just selling a vacant parcel.""

He also helps developers if an easement is needed through a neighbouring property but requirements for big transmission lines are government-run.

Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the renewable energy rollout as ""pure insanity"" and says no project should be above scrutiny ""especially when it involves prime agricultural land"".

He insists the bush is full and wants big solar restricted to large arrays on commercial buildings in Australia's cities.

But Mr Moroko knows farmers are giving up excess or marginal land, not prime grazing areas.

""In my experience, and I've done 30-plus deals, is that if it's really good grazing land, it's a 'no', because the money they get from grazing will be on a par if not higher than what they get for a solar farm,"" he says.

""If you've got excess land or back paddocks you don't use, you can get lease terms with a solar farm generating income every month for 20 or 30 years.""

There's ""huge demand"" as governments wake up to the fact they need multiple battery energy storage sites to capture abundant sunshine and release excess back into the grid to meet peak demand.

""Lots of people say 'no' they're not interested but then if their neighbour is keen, they're really interested so they're not left out,"" he says.

""They want to be the ones benefiting financially.""

They're happy to have a renewable energy project on land they can't see from their porch, he adds.

While big battery sites must be fenced off for safety reasons, sheep can graze through solar farms.

Farmers can also negotiate a pretty good deal for maintenance of solar projects, which is also beneficial to them and the community who provide the labour for above-market rates, Mr Moroko says.

Many farmers have big parcels of suitable land and make a million dollars a year leasing out 800 to a 1000 hectares while others can do the same with a smaller portion, even just 20 hectares, and still earn six figures.

Farmers for Climate Action polling across Central Queensland, NSW's Hunter and Illawarra found widespread support for renewables in the regions.

This followed a survey of farmers in December which found only one per cent saw transmission requirements as the top threat to their farm, while 55 per cent nominated climate change as the greatest threat to their farm.

""Income during drought is vital when you're trying to run a family farm and renewable energy delivers that,"" Farmers for Climate Action Chair Brett Hall says.

Typical payments being offered to farmers by wind companies are now more than $40,000 per turbine per year and many host dozens of turbines whilst still running sheep or cattle.

Asked about noise, one survey respondent said the only sound was the ""ka-ching"" of the cash register with every turn of the blade.

Solar companies are offering farmers around $1500 per hectare per year rent and they often continue to run sheep under the panels.

Mr Hall says the National Farmers Federation president makes money from wind turbines on his land and so does another previous NFF president.

But compulsory purchases by government remain controversial, including in the energy transition ""chokepoint"" of NSW.

Recent analysis by consultancy Green Energy Markets suggested the national target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 was already at risk.

The NSW government began public consultation on Friday on a review into improving compulsory land acquisition for infrastructure.

""We want to put people in the best position to understand their legal rights and ensure there are consistent and transparent acquisition processes across government,"" Minister for Lands and Property Steve Kamper says.

He says compulsory acquisitions are necessary at times to allow state infrastructure and other public projects to proceed for the benefit of the wider community.

""However, there are opportunities to improve processes which are being explored by this review to help landowners negotiate more effectively on their compensation.""

He also helps developers if an easement is needed through a neighbouring property but requirements for big transmission lines are government-run.

Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the renewable energy rollout as ""pure insanity"" and says no project should be above scrutiny ""especially when it involves prime agricultural land"".

He insists the bush is full and wants big solar restricted to large arrays on commercial buildings in Australia's cities.

But Mr Moroko knows farmers are giving up excess or marginal land, not prime grazing areas.

""In my experience, and I've done 30-plus deals, is that if it's really good grazing land, it's a 'no', because the money they get from grazing will be on a par if not higher than what they get for a solar farm,"" he says.

""If you've got excess land or back paddocks you don't use, you can get lease terms with a solar farm generating income every month for 20 or 30 years.""

There's ""huge demand"" as governments wake up to the fact they need multiple battery energy storage sites to capture abundant sunshine and release excess back into the grid to meet peak demand.

""Lots of people say 'no' they're not interested but then if their neighbour is keen, they're really interested so they're not left out,"" he says.

""They want to be the ones benefiting financially.""

They're happy to have a renewable energy project on land they can't see from their porch, he adds.

While big battery sites must be fenced off for safety reasons, sheep can graze through solar farms.

Farmers can also negotiate a pretty good deal for maintenance of solar projects, which is also beneficial to them and the community who provide the labour for above-market rates, Mr Moroko says.

Many farmers have big parcels of suitable land and make a million dollars a year leasing out 800 to a 1000 hectares while others can do the same with a smaller portion, even just 20 hectares, and still earn six figures.

Farmers for Climate Action polling across Central Queensland, NSW's Hunter and Illawarra found widespread support for renewables in the regions.

This followed a survey of farmers in December which found only one per cent saw transmission requirements as the top threat to their farm, while 55 per cent nominated climate change as the greatest threat to their farm.

""Income during drought is vital when you're trying to run a family farm and renewable energy delivers that,"" Farmers for Climate Action Chair Brett Hall says.

Typical payments being offered to farmers by wind companies are now more than $40,000 per turbine per year and many host dozens of turbines whilst still running sheep or cattle.

Asked about noise, one survey respondent said the only sound was the ""ka-ching"" of the cash register with every turn of the blade.

Solar companies are offering farmers around $1500 per hectare per year rent and they often continue to run sheep under the panels.

Mr Hall says the National Farmers Federation president makes money from wind turbines on his land and so does another previous NFF president.

But compulsory purchases by government remain controversial, including in the energy transition ""chokepoint"" of NSW.

Recent analysis by consultancy Green Energy Markets suggested the national target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 was already at risk.

The NSW government began public consultation on Friday on a review into improving compulsory land acquisition for infrastructure.

""We want to put people in the best position to understand their legal rights and ensure there are consistent and transparent acquisition processes across government,"" Minister for Lands and Property Steve Kamper says.

He says compulsory acquisitions are necessary at times to allow state infrastructure and other public projects to proceed for the benefit of the wider community.

""However, there are opportunities to improve processes which are being explored by this review to help landowners negotiate more effectively on their compensation.""

Face-to-face sessions will be held in the Hunter, North Coast, South Coast, Central West, New England and Riverina regions.

Such was the case until Wednesday's FOMC meeting announcement. While the meeting was largely as expected, with no real change to outlook, the outcome was seen as primarily ""dovish"" as Powell reaffirmed the Fed was still on track to cut rates three times this year.

""While The Fed kept its median dot at 3 cuts for 2024, beyond that the dots signal considerably less aggressive Fed rate-cutting. We also note that while the median 2024 dot remained the same, 8 Fed voters were for 50bps or less in Dec, now it's 9. The Fed now expects one less rate-cut in 2025 and 2026... and the so-called 'neutral' rate has also been increased."" - Zerohedge

With financial conditions now as loose as they were before the Fed started hiking rates, the markets remain unmoved by slightly more hawkish rhetoric.

With that announcement, the market surged to an all-time high, reversing the recent momentum weakness. The market remains in a nearly perfect trend that only Bernie Madoff could have designed. As we have repeated, to the point of ""ad nauseam,"" over the last several weeks, the market remains confined to a very defined channel. The 20-DMA continues as critical support where computer algorithms continue to ""buy dips,"" and sellers resurface at the channel's top.

For now, this mind-numbingly narrow channel, with extremely low volatility and high complacency, remains. What will change that dynamic? I have no idea. As shown, volatility continues to plumb the ""nether regions"" as investor optimism surges.

However, as is always the case, at some point, this will reverse itself. What triggers it is unknown, but a good warning sign will be a violation of the 20-DMA. As noted, we suspect such a violation will trip the algorithms into ""sell"" mode and increase downside price pressures. The problem for investors is that this bullish trend has already lasted much longer than expected and could continue. Therefore, we must maintain our current positioning and remain vigilant for a break of the trend channel to take more aggressive risk reduction actions.

As they say at amusement parks, ""Make sure your seat belts are fastened securely and enjoy the ride.""

Two weeks ago, we discussed whether the current market period was more indicative of a short-term top or a market bubble. Unsurprisingly, that article generated some debate on what defines a market bubble. This week, I thought we would tackle that definition.

According to Investopedia:

""A market bubble is a cycle that is characterized by the rapid escalation of market value, particularly in the price of assets. Typically, what creates a market bubble is a surge in asset prices driven by exuberant market behavior. During a market bubble, assets typically trade at a price that greatly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. Rather, the price does not align with the fundamentals of the asset.""

This definition is suitable for our discussion. There are three components of a ""market bubble."" The first two, price and valuation, often get dismissed or rationalized during the inflation phase. That rationalization is due to investor psychology and the ""Fear Of Missing Out (F.O.M.O.) Just recently, Bank of America posted the following chart of previous market bubbles in various asset classes, from gold to bitcoin.

As the following table shows, market bubbles are not new but rather the maturity of a secular market cycle.

During these historical market bubbles, the common belief was that ""this time is different."" Each period was marked by some industrial, economic, financial, or technological change that broke prior market relationships. Interestingly, Goldman Sachs recently made the same assumption, to wit:

""The recent rally has driven the market cap share in stocks with extremely high valuations to levels similar to those reached during the euphoria of 2021.

However, the prevalence of extreme valuations today looks far less widespread than in 2021 after adjusting for market concentration. The number of stocks with elevated EV/sales ratios has declined sharply from the peak in 2021. Unlike the broad-based ""growth at any cost"" in 2021, investors mostly pay high valuations for the largest growth stocks in the index. This dynamic more closely resembles the Tech Bubble than 2021. However, in contrast with the late '90s, we believe their fundamentals currently support the valuation of the Magnificent 7.""

What is essential to understand, and what is ultimately always overlooked, is that market bubbles are nothing more than a representation of investor psychology.

""All 2-sigma equity bubbles in developed countries have broken back to trend. But before they did, a handful went on to become superbubbles of 3-sigma or greater: in the U.S. in 1929 and 2000 and in Japan in 1989. There were also superbubbles in housing in the U.S. in 2006 and Japan in 1989. All five of these superbubbles corrected all the way back to trend with much greater and longer pain than average.

Are we currently in a market bubble? Maybe. Honestly, I have no idea. The problem is that market bubbles are only evident and acknowledged after they pop. This is because, during the inflation phase of the market bubble, investors rationalize why ""this time is different.""

As noted above, there are three components of market bubbles:

When investors bid up asset prices that exceed underlying earnings growth rates, market bubbles have previously been present. The reason is that since economic activity generates revenues and earnings, valuations can not indefinitely exceed the underlying fundamental realities. Since valuations are a function of price and earnings, deviations of the market from the long-term exponential growth trend have marked prior peaks.

Unsurprisingly, when price momentum gains momentum, investors rationalize why overpaying for earnings is justified this time. Unfortunately, as shown, such has rarely worked out well.

As the chart shows, and the definition of a market bubble states, ""assets typically trade at a price that significantly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. Instead, the price does not align with the fundamentals of the asset. ""

Crucially, excess valuations and price deviations from long-term norms are solely a function of investor psychology.

Valuation metrics are just that - a measure of current valuation. More importantly, when valuation metrics are excessive, it is a better measure of ""investor psychology"" and the manifestation of the ""greater fool theory."" As shown, there is a high correlation between our composite consumer confidence index and trailing 1-year S&P 500 valuations.

What valuations do provide is a reasonable estimate of long-term investment returns. It is logical that if you overpay for a stream of future cash flows today, your future return will be low.

So, if market bubbles are a function of investor psychology, we should focus on those measures to determine the risk to our portfolios. One of my favorite quotes on this subject comes from Howard Marks, the investing legend from Oaktree Capital Management. To wit:

""It's the swings of psychology that get people into the biggest trouble, especially since investors' emotions invariably swing in the wrong direction at the wrong time. When things are going well people become greedy and enthusiastic, and when times are troubled, people become fearful and reticent. That's just the wrong thing to do. It's important to control fear and greed.""

As discussed last week, investor allocations to equities are rising sharply as chasing asset market returns displaces logic and underlying fundamentals.

The American Association Of Individual Investors (AAII) allocation measures suggest the same, with investors increasing exposure to equities and reducing cash.

Also, the National Association of Investment Managers index shows that professional managers are 104% long equities in their portfolios. Such previous periods of exuberance have been more akin to market peaks than ongoing bull markets.

Aside from actual portfolio allocations, the best investor sentiment indicators are professional and retail investors, who are about as bullish as possible.

Does this mean we are in a market bubble currently? No. However, as Howard Marks previously noted:

""We can infer psychology from investor behavior. That allows us to understand how risky the market is, even though the direction in which it will head can never be known for certain. By understanding what's going on, we can infer the 'temperature' of the market.

We must remember to buy more when attitudes toward the market are cool and less when heated. For example, the ability to do inherently unsafe deals in quantity suggests a dearth of skepticism among investors. Likewise, when every new fund is oversubscribed, you know there's eagerness.""

Currently, there is little denying the more excessive bullish sentiment that abounds. Investors are willing to take on risk, overpay for underlying valuations, and rationalize their actions. Historically, these actions have been the precedents of every previous market bubble.

As Mark Hulbert once noted:

'I have no idea whether the stock market is actually forming a bubble that's about to break. But I do know that many bulls are fooling themselves when they think a bubble can't happen when there is such widespread concern. In fact, one of the distinguishing characteristics of a bubble is just that.""

Whether you agree a bubble exists is mainly irrelevant. Every investor approaches investing differently.

However, if you're nearing or are a retiree, your investment horizon is shorter than that of those much younger. Therefore, given that you are less able to recover from the deflation of a market bubble, it may be wise to consider the possibility.

So, what can you do to navigate the bubble?

The increase in speculative risks and excess leverage leaves the market vulnerable to a sizable correction. Unfortunately, the only missing ingredient is the catalyst that brings ""fear"" into an overly complacent marketplace.

Currently, investors believe ""this time IS different.""

""This time"" is different only because the variables are different. The variables always are, but outcomes are always the same.

When the bubble pops, the media will tell you, ""No one could have seen it coming.""

Of course, hindsight isn't very useful in protecting your capital.",talkmarkets.com,news,TalkMarkets,,-0.1450980392156863,448922611,1,,

Working with farmers and project developers, he brokers deals for one of the most hotly contested aspects of the energy transition - land.

The founder of Australia's first renewable energy land acquisition agency, Mr Moroko has secured four gigawatts of big batteries and 800 megawatts of solar farms over 30 individual agreements across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

His deals have so far reached $61 million, with some farmers getting almost double the value of back paddocks as Australia heads towards a mostly renewable-powered grid by 2030.

He says the sector is ""really, really booming"" as developers scramble to get their hands on big battery sites.

The landowner for a battery energy system being built on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula had to wait two-and-a-half years for approvals because of red tape but received almost double what his place is worth.

""The values can climb quite dramatically, which is really good for some people,"" Mr Moroko says.

""A lot of the time they can get 1.5 or double what their place is worth because it's a renewable energy development rather than someone just selling a vacant parcel.""

He also helps developers if an easement is needed through a neighbouring property but requirements for big transmission lines are government-run.

Arsenal leads the Premier League in goals from corners, accounting for 13 of all the 70 goals they've scored (out of 18 set-piece goals in total). In contrast our opponents next week, Man City, have only managed 11 set-piece goals in this campaign.

Arsenal have scored the most goals from corners in the Premier League this season (13).

-- Orbinho (@Orbinho) March 20, 2024

Our Arsenal, who are now leading the Premier League title race with 64 points after 28 match days, could only be there due to their efficiency in front of goal, with goals from corners key.

Mikel Arteta is truly unique. The Arsenal manager's brilliant technical bench (having a great set-piece coach like Nicolas Jover, whom he signed from Manchester City) and his attention to detail are obvious in the team's ability to efficiently exploit set-piece situations, converting corners into crucial goal-scoring chances.

As Arsenal prepares to meet Manchester City in a ""Premier League Final"" at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, March 31, 2024, their mastery of corners could be a weapon against their league title rivals.

With the demands on the Gunners to stay at the top after making it there, this newfound secret weapon from set pieces could help them keep their competitive edge and pursue silverware in the seasons to come. The inverted fullback role was a hit for the Gunners last season; this season, they've added capitalizing on corners as a key tactic.

So what could be the next game-changing tactic? We will have to wait and see.

That means it probably won't be confused with places like California's Silicon Valley or Austin, Texas.

But some local leaders say Las Vegas is making strides in technology.

""Ten years ago, if you asked people in the technology industry what they thought about the Las Vegas community, they would talk about gaming,"" said Robert Rippey, executive director of UNLV's Black Fire Innovation Hub. ""They'll also say Las Vegas is very good at hospitality and entertainment. But what they didn't realize is that gaming companies are also a different type of company. They're technology companies; , a data company and a retail company.""

Southern Nevada has a very strong gaming industry, giving the region an advantage as the region's technology sector continues to grow, Rippey said.

Las Vegas technology companies like Switch and Plan A Technologies have made strides here in recent years, helping to change the narrative about the city.

""In Las Vegas, the weather is great, the tax environment is great. There's a certain ease of mobility here,"" said Aaron Ezra, chairman of Plan A Technologies, a software engineering firm. ""There's a lot to like about it. I think the city continues to make strides in attracting different types of businesses.""

Ezra should know. He came from California to build Plan A into what it is today, a company that does business with some of the Strip District's biggest companies.

""I don't think people realize how much technology goes into building a great gaming company,"" Ezra said. ""We have a lot of companies here in town that build not only games, but security systems, accounting systems, loyalty systems, and all the infrastructure that makes the gaming experience fun and seamless.""

Black Fire is home to dozens of companies with locations and products at the center.

This includes Piaggio Fast Forward, which develops robots. His one of Black Fire's prototypes is a device that follows a person wherever he goes, holding everything from groceries to essentials for a day at the beach or pool. It's a hands-free robot that can carry up to 40 pounds.

Tina Quigley, president and CEO of the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, is working to attract businesses to Southern Nevada. One of the biggest obstacles she faces, she says, is convincing the company's decision makers that Las Vegas is not just a place to visit, but also a place to put down roots.

""The challenge is that they immediately think of hospitality and games,"" she says. ""It's really important to get people here and see all that our community has to offer.""

Mr. Quigley supported an initiative called ""Locate Las Vegas,"" a gathering of local business leaders that hosted many business owners during Super Bowl week. The goal was to sell the group on the idea of moving to Las Vegas. Quigley says it was a success.

""I think we all expected maybe three of them to be here,"" Quigley said. ""I would be surprised if within 12 to 18 months we no longer see eight or nine of the companies that have some kind of presence here.""

Rippy said the foundation has been laid, but more needs to be done to promote Las Vegas to technology leaders.

""What will take us to the next level is access to investment capital, venture capital,"" Rippy said. ""That's Silicon Valley, and I would say they're starting to pay attention to what's going on here.""

The protest took place Monday at John Jay High School, which is part of the Wappingers Central School District.

The school's policy is that students can use any bathroom they choose that suits their preferred version of their gender identity, according to Spectrum News.

""A bunch of people from our school, John Jay, feel uncomfortable,"" Shauna Neilan, a senior at John Jay High School, said.

""We want to change that and give them their own spaces to make us more comfortable and them more comfortable,"" she said.

A petition started by Neilan alleged incidents have taken place in a restroom focusing on one transgender student.

Wappingers Central School District Superintendent Dwight Bonk said he is not aware of any such incident.

Bork noted that the school will have code of conduct discussions with students who participated in the protest.

Cory Pittore, a senior at the school, took part in a counter-protest.

""I feel as though that we shouldn't be silenced no matter what,"" Pittore, who claims she identifies as a male, said.

""We are human, just like everyone else. I, myself, have been struggling with this for so long, and I just feel like we shouldn't be silenced because we're human ourselves,"" Pittore said.

An ""inclusivity"" group called Defense of Democracy came in to lead the counter-protest, according to Spectrum News.

""It is not enough to just stand up with trans students, we must fight their oppressors,"" said one of the organizers, according to cable outlet News 12 Westchester.

In a statement, Bonk said the school follows the law.

""Under state and federal laws (including Title IX and New York State's Dignity for All Students Act), school districts are required to provide access to transgender students to the restroom of the sex with which they identify, which may not be the student's sex assigned at birth,"" he said.

""The District is fully aware of its obligations to its transgender population (as well as to the entirety of the student body) under these laws and remains fully committed to protecting these students and ensuring that they can safely access these rights,"" the statement said.

His statement said the protest ""involved approximately 20 students that was peaceful and concluded without incident.

""I was personally present at the school during the protest and the students had the opportunity to exercise their free speech rights to express their positions in a manner which is both respectful, safe, and in accordance with the requirements of the School District and governmental authorities,"" he said.",westernjournal.com,news,The Western Journal,Jack Davis,0.0117647058823529,448922029,1,https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trans-restroom-protest.jpg,eng-9420425

WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors, stifles innovation and keeps prices artificially high. The lawsuit -- filed with 16 state attorneys general -- is just the latest example of aggressive antitrust enforcement by an administration that has also taken on Google, Amazon and other tech giants with the stated aim of making the digital universe more fair, innovative and competitive.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors, stifles innovation and keeps prices artificially high.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone market and leverages control over the iPhone to ""engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.""

""Apple has locked its consumers into the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,"" said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Stalling the advancement of the very market it revolutionized, she said, it has ""smothered an entire industry.""

Apple called the lawsuit ""wrong on the facts and the law"" and said it ""will vigorously defend against it.""

The suit takes aim at how Apple allegedly molds its technology and business relationships to ""extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others.""

That includes diminishing the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, limiting access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets and refusing to allow its iMessage app to exchange encrypted messaging with competing platforms.

It specifically seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps -- in areas including streaming, messaging and digital payments -- and prevent it from continuing to craft contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that let it ""obtain, maintain, extend or entrench a monopoly.""

The lawsuit -- filed with 16 state attorneys general -- is just the latest example of aggressive antitrust enforcement by an administration that has also taken on Google, Amazon and other tech giants with the stated aim of making the digital universe more fair, innovative and competitive.

""The Department of Justice has an enduring legacy taking on the biggest and toughest monopolies in history,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. ""Today we stand here once again to promote competition and innovation for next generation of technology.""

Antitrust researcher Dina Srinavasan, a Yale University fellow, compared the lawsuit's significance to the government's action against Microsoft a quarter century ago -- picking a ""tremendous fight"" with what has been the world's most prosperous company.

""It's a really big deal to go up and punch someone who is acting like a bully and pretending not to be a bully,"" she said.

President Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce antitrust statutes. While its stepped-up policing of corporate mergers and questionable business practices has met resistance from some business leaders -- accusing the Democratic administration of overreach -- it's been lauded by others as long overdue.

The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has assiduously built around the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch to create what is often referred to as a ""walled garden"" so its hardware and software can seamlessly offer user-friendly harmony.

The strategy has helped Apple attain an annual revenue of nearly $400 billion and, until recently, a market value of more than $3 trillion. But Apple's shares have fallen by 7% this year even as most of the stock market has climbed to new highs, resulting in long-time rival Microsoft seizing the mantle as the world's most valuable company.

Apple said the lawsuit, if successful, would ""hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple -- where hardware, software, and services intersect"" and would ""set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.""

""At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love -- designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people's privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,"" the company said in a statement. ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.

Apple has defended the walled garden as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has described the barrier as a way for the iPhone to distinguish itself from devices running on Google's Android software, which isn't as restrictive and is licensed to a wide range of manufacturers.

""Apple claims to be a champion of protecting user data, but its app store fee structure and partnership with Google search erode privacy,"" Consumer Reports senior researcher Sumit Sharma said in a statement.

The lawsuit complains that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and that the high margins it earns on each is more than double what others in the industry get. And when users run an internet search, Google gives Apple a ""significant cut"" of the advertising revenue those searches generate.

The company's app store also charges developers up to 30 percent of the app's price for consumers.

Critics of Apple's alleged anticompetitive practices have long complained that its claim to prioritize user privacy is hypocritical when profits are at stake. While its iMessage services is sheathed from prying eyes by end-to-end encryption, that protection evaporates the moment someone texts a non-Apple device.

But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert, said that while he believes Apple needs reigning in, he's concerned that the Justice Department's focus on messaging may be misplaced and could weaken security and privacy.

""I am quite glad that access to SMS messages is restricted,"" said Strafach, creator of the Guardian Firewall app.

He notes that a number of apps, ostensibly for weather and news, on iPhones have secretly and persistently sent users' GPS data to third parties. Strafach said he is concerned weakened Apple security ""could open the door to stalkerware/spouseware, which is already more difficult to install on Apple devices compared to Android.""

However, prominent critic Cory Doctorow has complained that while Apple has blocked entities like Facebook from spying on its users it runs its ""own surveillance advertising empire"" that gathers the same kinds of personal data but for its own use.

""Apple has a history of clandestine deals with surveillance giants like Google, and (CEO) Tim Cook gave Uber a slap on the wrist instead of an app store ban when (the ride-sharing company) built a backdoor to spy on iPhone users who had already deleted Uber's app,"" noted Sean O'Brien, founder of Yale's Privacy Lab.

Fears about an antitrust crackdown on Apple's business model haven't just contributed to the drop in the company's stock price, there also is concern it lags behind Microsoft and Google in the push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence technology.

Antitrust regulators made it clear in their complaint that they see Apple's walled garden mostly as a weapon to ward off competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices that have propelled its lofty profit margins while stifling innovation.

""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,,"" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. Left unchallenged, Apple would ""only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,"" he added.

William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who teaches at George Washington University, said he expects the core of Apple's defense to be that it is not at all a monopoly in the smartphone market. Justice Department lawyers have built a ""high-quality"" argument of harm in the 88-page indictment with ""impressive excerpts from the firm's own documents,"" he said.

But don't expect a verdict until 2026 -- which means the case could easily drag on with appeals.

The case escalates the Biden administration's antitrust siege, which has already triggered lawsuits against Google and Amazon accusing them in engaging in illegal tactics to thwart competition, as well as unsuccessful attempts to block new acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

In addition the FTC sued Facebook in 2020 over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.

Kovacic predicts antitrust action by the FTC or Justice Department against Microsoft over its relationship with OpenAI is ""coming up around the corner,"" and ""the two agencies are fighting over who will handle that better.""

""They foreshadowed this would be their agenda and they're filling out the agenda the way they said,"" he added. ""These are all high-stakes matters, and you can expect an intense and aggressive defense.""

Apple's business interests are also entangled in the Justice Department's case against Google, which went to trial last fall and is headed toward final arguments scheduled to begin May 1 in Washington, D.C. In that case, regulators are alleging Google has stymied competition by paying for the rights for its already dominant online search engine to be the automatic place to handle queries on the iPhone and a variety of web browsers in an arrangement that generates an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually.

With the Justice Department mounting a direct attack across its business, Apple stands to lose even more.

During a volatile three-year span, home prices surged as ultra-low mortgage rates ignited a buying frenzy, only to retreat when borrowing costs spiked due to the Federal Reserve's mission to contain inflation. Now, although mortgage rates remain elevated, their reduced volatility compared with the peak of the pandemic has played a key role in steadying home-price growth.

In February, home prices advanced 0.6% M/M, in line with the 0.6% average monthly gain in the roughly eight years leading up to the pandemic, online brokerage Redfin (RDFN) said in a recent report. Similarly, on a Y/Y basis, prices climbed 6.7% in February, compared with the 6.9% average gain in the years preceding the pandemic. This is based on the February Redfin Home Price Index, an equal-weight repeat sales gauge, covering the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024.

Elevated mortgage rates, caused by the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle, has dampened homebuyer demand over the years, but ""that's not translating into lower home prices today because there still aren't enough homes for sale - even as new listings rebound,"" the report noted.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, new listings gained 3.8% M/M in February to the highest level since September 2022, Redfin said in a separate report, a sign that the supply of homes is finally starting to expand from exceptionally tight levels.

That's ""great news for buyers who for months have been competing for a tiny pool of homes for sale,"" said Redfin Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao. ""Still, many house hunters are hesitant to pull the trigger because mortgage rates and home prices remain elevated.""

The current housing shortage, stemming from post-pandemic increases in material costs, interest rates and inflation, effectively puts the so-called lock-in effect under the spotlight, whereby homeowners are unwilling to list their homes as they don't want to give up the low mortgage rates they locked in before the Fed starting jacking up rates.

Zillow's (ZG) (Z) latest monthly report also showed new listings of existing homes on its platform jumped 20% in February vs. January and 21% Y/Y. And, at just above 900K, there were more homes for sales in February than in any other February since 2020, the company added.

""We're finally beginning to see owners who have been putting off moves return to the market,"" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. ""For many households with record-high equity, waiting out potentially lower rates later in the year may not be worth it.""

When the Fed started its rate-hiking campaign in March 2022, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at roughly 4%. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was in the 2%-3% range in 2020, when the pandemic shut down the economy and the Federal Open Market Committee cut rates to near zero to spur spending. Before long, pandemic-induced inflation pressures prompted the Fed in March 2022 to start what became its most aggressive rate-hiking campaign in decades, with mortgage rates zooming past 4% at the time. Ratcheting up its benchmark lending rate to 5.25-5.50% from near zero, mortgage rates in late 2023 topped out at 7.79% - the highest level seen in over 20 years - before ebbing to 6.87% as of March 21, according to Freddie Mac data on the St. Louis Fed's FRED database.

So far in 2024, the year in which the Fed expects to start easing monetary policy, mortgage rates have stayed in a relatively narrow range of ~6.60%-6.95%. Mortgage-rate volatility may be easing, but housing affordability is still at depressed levels, hence the lingering standoff between buyers and sellers.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Max Gottlich,0.3725490196078431,448921800,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1391413216/image_1391413216.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,

Could the stock market ride to his rescue?

Trump Media, which runs the social media platform Truth Social, is poised to become a publicly listed company, after a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp voted on Friday to acquire it.

Trump is due to have a stake of at least 58% in the merged company, worth nearly $3bn at Digital World's current share prices.

It's an astonishing potential windfall for Trump in exchange for a business whose own auditor warned last year it was at risk of failure.

Never mind the many red flags associated with the deal, including unresolved lawsuits from former business partners.

There's also an $18m settlement that Digital World agreed to pay last year to resolve fraud charges over how the merger plan came together.

Shares in Digital World dropped more than 13% on Friday after the approval, ending the day at $36.94.

Backers of Digital World -- the vast majority of whom are individual investors instead of Wall Street firms, many apparently Trump loyalists -- seemed unfazed.

""This is just the start,"" Chad Nedohin, a deal supporter, said on his show DWAC Live on the video platform Rumble after the approval was announced. ""There's no reason to freak out.""

Digital World, or DWAC (pronounced D-whack), is what is known as a SPAC, or a shell business created expressly to buy another firm and take it public.

The company will now be renamed Trump Media & Technology Group and could start trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker DJT as soon as next week.

The deal is unlikely to immediately resolve Trump's most pressing financial issues, such as his New York fraud penalty.

The former president is barred from selling or transferring his shares for at least six months -- though the new company could grant him an exemption.

Trump could also try to get a loan, backed by the value of the shares. But in this case, analysts said a bank would probably lend him significantly less than the shares are worth on paper, given the potential risks of the business.

That hasn't stopped some of his supporters hoping their backing will help.

Nedohin, who describes himself on his website as a Canadian ""worship leader"" and goes by Captain DWAC on Truth Social, declined to be interviewed.

But on his show this week he urged investors to approve the deal, speculating it could help the former president in his legal battles.

""If the merger is complete Friday at 10 a.m. and Trump all of a sudden has... shares of DJT that's worth three, four, five $10bn, who knows? He could easily leverage that to get a loan,"" he said.

He added: ""This is putting your money where your mouth is for free speech, to save your country, potentially losing it all.""

The risk that Digital World shareholders will lose money on their investment is significant, according to analysts.

Share prices are down from the highs they reached after plans to purchase Trump Media were announced in 2021.

But even after Friday's slide, they still imply Trump Media has a value of almost $5bn, which is a lot given it brought in just $3.3m in revenue in the first nine months of last year and lost nearly $50m.

The merger will provide an influx of more than $200m in cash to Trump Media, which it could use for growth and expansion.

But for now Truth Social, which launched to the general public in 2022, branding itself as an alternative to major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, remains small.

It claims about 8.9 million sign-ups and in regulatory filings Trump Media warns prospective investors that it does not track metrics like user growth or engagement that could give them a sense of its operations. And it says it has little intention of doing so.

Outside firms estimate Truth Social received about five million visits in February. By comparison, Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, and recently valued by one investor at about $14bn, received more than 100 million visits.

Analysts said Digital World was a prime example of a ""meme stock"", in which the share price is divorced from a company's fundamentals -- and near-destined to fall, eventually.

""With Trump Media, I expect that it will collapse but whether it's going to occur a week from now or two years from now and how rapidly... those things are really difficult to predict,"" said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who tracks public listings.

Marco Iachini, senior vice-president of research at Vanda Securities, said individual investors piled into Digital World stock after the Trump deal was announced, and again in January, after he won the Iowa primary.

Ahead of the vote this week, he said there had been less activity, a sign that professional firms might be the ones driving the trading.

Whatever is motivating buyers, Trump, whose main contributions to Trump Media have been his name and posts on the platform, appears poised to be the top beneficiary.

""It's an enormous transfer of value from [investors]... to Trump, which stands to be extremely lucrative for him,"" says Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University who has studied listings of companies such as Trump Media. -- BBC",saudigazette.com.sa,news,Saudi Gazette,,0.1215686274509804,448921418,1,https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2024/03/23/2369701.jpg,

The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, made the disclosure in a statement on Saturday.

Recall that the state government had last Sunday commenced discounted sales of food items across the five divisions of the state.

Food items such as rice, beans, gari, bread, eggs, tomatoes, pepper, among others, were sold at 25 percent discount to residents.

Omotoso said that the discounted food markets, called ""Ounjè Èkò"" would reopen to Lagosians on Sunday (tomorrow).

He said: ""Governor Sanwo-Olu rolled out the initiative, amongst others, to impact lives in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, MSME trade, food, education, and health. They will all be run under the theme, EKO CARES.

""The Ounjè Èkò market pilot scheme began on Sunday March 17 with sales of dicounted food items, such as rice, beans,garri, bread, eggs, and perishables - tomato, pepper, rodo and onions.

""Local food vendors have witnessed increased sales since the exercise started, just as residents in each locality are excited at the low prices.""

To prevent sharp practices and ensure that many residents benefit from the intervention, the government had introduced voucher system during the pilot scheme of the initiative.

Last Sunday, a 5kg bag of rice sold for N5,325 while 1kg went for N1,065; 5kg bag of Beans - N6,225 while 1kg sold for N1,245.

But Omotoso advised residents ""to look out for prices of the items displayed in each locality as they might slightly differ in different locations.""

Recall that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had in February announced plans to open Sunday Markets where residents can buy food items at discounted rates in about 42 markets across the state.

This, he said, was to cushion the effect of the current economic challenges.

He had said: ""We are going to be opening 'Sunday Markets' in about 42 markets in Lagos. This time you'll be buying at a reduced cost. We're going to cap what you can buy at not more than N25,000 and we're going to be giving you a 25% rebate immediately there.

""Somebody that wants to buy N10,000. N15,000, which are the people that we want to take out from poverty, we will give you an immediate discount of about 25 per cent.

""The third level will be that we are doing what we call the Soup Bowl. We want to identify 'Mama Put', caterers and we want to be able to feed between 1,000 and 1,500 in every local government per day, at the first instance between the next 30 to 60 days.""",thewhistler.ng,news,The Whistler Nigeria,Ikenna Omeje,0.1764705882352942,448921253,1,https://thewhistler.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nigerian-Market-1.jpg,eng-9421150

The sizzle at this past week's KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Paris was all about Kubernetes-based infrastructure for generative artificial intelligence. The steak, in contrast, was all about platforms.

I attend conferences such as KubeCon to uncover particularly innovative vendors who are pushing the boundaries of their respective technologies. Since is my seventh article for SiliconANGLE covering this flagship open-source conference, my goal was to uncover vendors I hadn't spoken to before.

Here are six such innovators - plus one former client whose recent acquisition makes them deserving of inclusion on this exclusive list.

Observability is all about the data, and wherever you find data these days, you find large language models or LLMs, the technology behind generative AI.

Most observability vendors are slapping LLMs on their solutions to give them natural language chat interfaces - useful, but not particularly revolutionary.

Robusta Dev Ltd., in contrast, uses LLMs to implement observability-based intelligent agents: autonomous pieces of software that can not only uncover root causes of operational issues, but also take action to remediate them.

Robusta's agents approach their tasks iteratively, adjusting dynamically to shifting data. As a result, Robusta is particularly well-suited to resolving issues in dynamic cloud native deployments.

Platform engineering was a hot topic at KubeCon, second only to AI on the buzz meter. Vendors support enterprise platform engineering efforts with internal developer platforms. What an IDP product offering actually looks like, however, can vary dramatically from one vendor to another.

The central question: How opinionated should the IDP on offer be? Is it better to let the customer decide the best way to build and use their IDP, or should the IDP vendor instill best practices into the platform?

At one extreme: MIA srl, aka Mia-Platform. Mia-Platform offers a platform for building IDPs, empowering platform engineers to choose from a multitude of open-source or commercial tools when constructing their own IDPs.

Mia then focuses on providing a consistent user interface, streamlining the developer experience across the software lifecycle. Mia's flexibility enables platform engineering teams to incorporate legacy tooling as they modernize their infrastructure to cloud native.

At the opposite extreme is Kapeta Inc. Kapeta sells an opinionated IDP - prebuilt for quick deployment. Given other IDPs can take years to deploy, this highly opinionated approach has obvious advantages. Unlike less opinionated offerings, Kapeta offers rapid time-to-value.

Once platform engineers have deployed the Kapeta platform, they can tweak the tools it connects to via Kapeta's plugin architecture. Kapeta is thus able to balance the value of an opinionated IDP with the flexibility necessary to adjust it to each customer's needs.

Day 0 refers to the planning phase of cloud-native infrastructure deployment. Given the complexity of the Kubernetes ecosystem, simply coming up with a plan of attack is an onerous task.

Day 1 means the initial deployment of Kubernetes and all its associated add-ons, while day 2 refers to full production of multiple Kubernetes clusters, often in hybrid multicloud environments.

Few vendors other than long-term market incumbents have the wherewithal to support all three days. DaoCloud Network Technology Co. Ltd., however, has plunged into the deep end.

DaoCloud offers a layered enterprise Kubernetes platform solution. It provides a day 0 platform that adds an app store and application delivery capabilities to its cloud-native community edition foundation. These capabilities include CI/CD pipelines and GitOps support.

On top of this day 0 offering, DaoCloud's advanced offering adds microservice governance and observability. The full enterprise premium edition layers on multicloud orchestration and real-time data services.

The result is an end-to-end cloud native platform that can meet the needs of the most complex of enterprise scenarios.

Earlier generations of application programming interface gateways and management platforms handle the security and availability of APIs on an individual basis, leaving it up to the developer of the consuming application to know which APIs to access and when.

The current generation leverages the power of GraphQL to combine APIs, connecting them to a data graph that enables the front-end developer to specify the data they want rather than the specific API.

Tyk Technologies Ltd. offers a universal data graph that unifies multiple APIs into a single GraphQL API endpoint. Tyk provides both an API gateway as well as a developer portal, leveraging an all open-source technology base to deliver high-performance API capabilities.

Apollo Graph Inc. also leverages GraphQL to implement JOIN-like combinations of APIs. They offer a query planner that works in an analogous way to traditional relational database SQL interpreters, giving developers the ability to build business-centric APIs that abstract the underlying application endpoints.

Via this abstraction, Apollo gives front-end developers the ability to maintain the business context of underlying data without the need to deal with the protocols or parameters of the back-end APIs.

I worked briefly with Octopus Deploy Pty. Ltd. in its early startup days, but the company has come so far in the intervening years that it deserves a spot in this article.

The vendor's most recent news is its acquisition of CodeFresh, Inc., the purveyor of a leading CI/CD platform and the champion of the popular Argo open-source CD tool.

Octopus Deploy places CI/CD into the context of individual environments, for example dev, staging and production. Each of these environments might comprise elements in different clouds, perhaps incorporating different infrastructure components or Kubernetes clusters.

It abstracts out all such details, giving developers and DevOps engineers the ability to move workloads from one environment to another without having to worry about the messy details. Rolling back to a previous environment is also dead simple with Octopus.

Octopus supports other environments for other situations, for example, edge computing. On the edge, companies may define specific environments by geography (""push this code to California"") or by business context (""push this code to all refineries"").

Management thought leader Geoffrey Moore famously described the chasm between early adopters and the early majority users of a given technology. Early adopters are willing to try immature technologies to obtain early-mover advantages. The early majority, in contrast, simply want to get their jobs done.

The 12,000-strong crowd at KubeCon was generally more interested in solving their business problems than worrying about being early movers, a clear sign that Kubernetes -- and the more mature components of its ecosystem -- have reached early-majority status.

For innovators such as the vendors in this article, this chasm crossing raises the bar. Offerings must clearly address recognized enterprise challenges or buyers won't bite. It's time to get down to business.",siliconangle.com,news,SiliconANGLE,,0.3568627450980393,448921227,1,https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/03/KubeConEU1.jpg,

As data centers continue to evolve and the push for AI becomes universal, tech companies have been flocking to join the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, which launched last summer hosted by The Linux Foundation. UEC focuses on enhancing Ethernet to meet the low latency and high bandwidth requirements of advanced AI and HPC (High-Performance Computing) applications, making it a competitive alternative to other high-performance networking technologies.

Forty-five new members have joined the Ultra Ethernet Consortium since November 2023 when the organization began accepting new members, underscoring the industry demand for a complete Ethernet-based communication stack architecture for high-performance networking. The interest of all these tech companies highlights a need that the UEC is meeting in the industry, says J Metz, Chair of the UEC Steering Committee.

UEC's membership originally consisted of 10 steering members, bringing the total number of members today to 55 following its fivefold burst in growth this last few months. Its founding members are AMD, Arista, Broadcom, Cisco, Eviden, HPE, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft. The newcomers to the group include Baidu, Dell, Huawei, IBM, Nokia, Lenovo, Supermicro, and Tencent.

Since its founding last year, the Ultra Ethernet Consortium has built up a considerably deep talent bench. There are a total of 715 industry experts engaged in eight working groups: physical layer, link layer, transport layer, software layer, storage, compliance, management, and performance & debug.

UEC notes that many large clusters including hyperscale deployments of GPUs used for AI training are already operating on Ethernet-based IP networks, due to their significant advantages, which include a broad, multi-vendor ecosystem of interoperable Ethernet switches, NICs, cables, transceivers, optics, management tools and software and a proven history of the routing scale of IP networks, as well as the established IEEE Ethernet standards.

""We expect these advantages to become table-stakes requirements, and that Ethernet networks will increasingly dominate AI and HPC workloads of all sizes in the future""

The UEC wants to minimize communication stack changes while maintaining and promoting Ethernet interoperability. To that end, it is developing specifications, API interfaces, and source code to define protocols, electrical and optical signaling characteristics, link-level and end-to-end network transport protocols and management mechanisms, software, storage, and security constructs.

In short, it wants to optimize AI and HPC workloads by modernizing remote direct memory access (RDMA) operation over Ethernet. It is pushing to replace the legacy RoCE protocol with Ultra Ethernet Transport, an open protocol specification designed to run over IP and Ethernet.

The industry will soon see exactly what the UEC has been developing. Work on the spec has followed a very aggressive timeline, with version 1.0 slated to be released by Q3 2024.",techspot.com,news,TechSpot,Erika Morphy,0.2549019607843137,448921223,1,https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2024/03/2024-03-23-image-3.jpg,

Institutions are seen as formal and informal rules that can be evaluated and, although oftentimes durable, reformed. The primary purpose of institutions is to guide and constrain human behavior in a world characterized by uncertainty and self-interested motives, such that human actions are more conducive to long-term, aggregate preference satisfaction. The first essay, ""Social Order through Constitutional Choice: A Contractarian Proposal,"" introduces a normative criterion for legitimate constitutional change, based in James Buchanan's brand of contractarianism, and proceeds to outline a specific constitutional proposal. The proposed constitution consists of a common core, representing Nozick's minimal state, and a set of subconstitutions between which citizens can choose, irrespective of geographic location, and which encompass different scopes of government. The second essay, ""Rhetoric or Reality? An Economic Analysis of the Effects of Religion in Sweden,"" views religious beliefs, themselves taken as given, as entailing moral positions, here seen as informal institutions, which influence behavior in a predictable fashion. An empirical study of divorce rates, rates of children born out of wedlock, abortion rates, and rates of not paying one's debts in Swedish municipalities reveal that the stronger the religious involvement, the less of these particular behaviors is seen. Interestingly, the negative influence of involvement in the Lutheran state church is greater, on the margin, than the negative influence stemming from involvement in (generally more conservative) independent churches. The third essay, ""Economic Freedom and Equality: Friends or Foes?"" looks at economic policies as sets of variable institutions which influence economic activities, and thereby efficiency and the income distribution, in various ways. A cross-country study reveals that economic freedom, defined in the form of an index measuring such things as tax pressure, protection of property rights, a functioning judicial system, low inflation, and freedom to trade, can be positively related to income equality. This holds in developing countries when economic freedom is increased over a longer time period in a stable manner and when the increase is the result of trade and capital-flow liberalization. Then, the poor seem to be able to take advantage of the freer economy to a larger extent than those who are better off.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.01960784313725483,448920153,1,,

Out of the four bear species found in the country, Wildlife SOS works toward the conservation of three - sloth bears, Himalayan brown bears and Asiatic black bears.

Having resolved the 400-year-old 'dancing' bear tradition by rescuing and rehabilitating over 620 sloth bears from the streets of India, Wildlife SOS is now focusing on conservation of this species in the wild. The NGO, along with the forest department, has launched a comprehensive Sloth Bear Radio Collaring project in the state of Karnataka, aimed at understanding sloth bear movements, population status and distribution within the state. Studying these factors by employing GPS collars will help identify specific factors contributing to human‐sloth bear conflict. The NGO will also assess the nature and frequency of human-bear conflicts, and eventually recommend mitigation measures.

Dr. Arun A. Sha, Director- Research & Veterinary Operations, Wildlife SOS said, ""We plan to collar and track several sloth bears using GPS technology. The collaring process involves laying out barrel traps, tranquilising the bears with the assistance of the forest department, and attaching the GPS collars. The animals are then observed for a few hours before being safely released back into the wild at their place of tranquilisation.""

Additionally, the Wildlife SOS team works in northern India's Kashmir to track and radio collar brown bears. Following a preliminary field study in 2021, the organisation found the brown bears venturing into lower altitudes to the garbage dumps and human settlements for food, resulting in the trash habituation of bears and human-brown bear conflicts.

This resulted in conducting a radio-collaring project of brown bears in the Thajwas - Baltal Wildlife Sanctuary of Sonmarg, in conjunction with the J&K Wildlife Protection Department. Some of the primary objectives of the study is to understand the bears' habitat utilisation, movement pattern, activity pattern and hibernation period, to name a few. Wildlife SOS has also worked on conflict mitigation measures and conducted research on human-Asiatic black bear conflict in the Kashmir Valley. Expanding its conservation efforts, the NGO has rescued black bears from aggressive conflict situations, and placed them under long-term care.

Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS said, ""Our preliminary study found that 75% of the diet of the bears who frequented human-made garbage dumps included plastic, chocolates and organic food waste. The improper disposal of waste is a major factor that attracts bears close to human settlements, thereby increasing the risk of direct conflict. That's why this study is crucial for us to come up with scientific solutions to mitigate conflict.""

Geeta Seshamani, Co-founder and Secretary, Wildlife SOS said, ""Working on three of the four types of bears found in India shows our commitment toward the conservation of these species. Bears still face issues such as loss of their home, encroachment of their habitat, retaliation due to lack of behaviour awareness, to name a few. So our work does not stop here and we will continue strive for a better world where co-existence is possible.""",india.com,news,"India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com",,0.1843137254901961,448919482,1,https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/QT-bear.jpg,eng-9412134

Concurrently, there has been an equally drastic change in the conduct of monetary policy and a shift away from the previous reliance on regulatory policy instruments. This deregulation of markets and policy is the starting point for this dissertation, which discusses various aspects of the behavior of the money market and how interest rates and other financial variables are affected by monetary policy. A major topic in the dissertation is the question of international interest rate dependence, i.e., the extent to which independent control of domestic monetary variables is possible. This problem, which is important both for monetary policy and for the understanding of the money market in general, is analyzed theoretically using models of international asset pricing. The discussion emphasizes the role of the foreign exchange risk premium in the relation between domestic and foreign interest rates. A detailed study is also made of a currency basket system and its implications for the risk premium and the interest rate dependence. Another important topic is the relation between interest rates on assets with different times to maturity, i.e., the term structure of interest rates. The behavior of the term structure in the Swedish money market is studied with special emphasis on the role of interest rate expectations. Among the problems addressed is also the role of discount window policies, i.e., the conditions under which banks are allowed to borrow reserves from the central bank. The analysis focuses on what these rules imply for the behavior of interest rates and the effects of various policy instruments, and on how discount window policies should be designed to improve monetary control.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2549019607843137,448919208,1,,

The subsequent price drop in Bitcoin also led to a pessimistic atmosphere in the spot Bitcoin ETF market recently. Despite a continuous decrease in net inflows, CryptoQuant's CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out that there could be a potential revival in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.

ContentsCEO's Comments on Bitcoin ETFsHow Much is 1 Bitcoin in Dollars? CEO's Comments on Bitcoin ETFs

In a statement made on March 22nd, Ki Young Ju highlighted that despite the downturns in BTC price, there could be an increase in net inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs. The analyst noted that, based on historical net inflow trends, demand for Bitcoin ETFs generally increased after BTC reached certain support levels.

According to data provided by BitMEX Research, BTC ETFs have shown a negative outlook over the last four trading sessions.

This was attributed to significant outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, while record-low inflows for other ETFs, including BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC, were also considered contributing factors.

Young Ju mentioned that recent BTC whales, especially those based on ETFs, have an average cost of around $56,000. This suggests that these foundational market players, particularly ETF investors, typically purchase Bitcoin at an average price level of $56,000.

With all this data in mind, the CEO indicated that if BTC falls to the mentioned price threshold, there could be significant entries into the spot Bitcoin ETF market.

Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin's price continued to trade between $62,000 and $68,000. On the other hand, Young Ju stated that corrections typically happen with a maximum of 30%, suggesting that such a decline would be sufficient for the market.

Following the expected drop from Bitcoin's recent peak of $73,750, the price of BTC is predicted to fall as low as $51,000.

While these predictions and assumptions continue to be presented by analysts and notable figures, Bitcoin is currently trading at $64,627 at the time of writing. This price level indicates a 1.26% increase for BTC.

1:00 JST, March 24, 2024

GREENSBORO, N.C. -- The president of Honda Aircraft Co., a U.S. subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., said the aircraft manufacturer aims to sell 60 HondaJet small business aircraft annually by 2028, about three times more than in 2023.

Honda Aircraft President Hideto Yamasaki said in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun that he plans for the company to have a surplus by 2028 when production of the new business jet HondaJet Echelon starts.Since launching HondaJet in 2015, Honda Aircraft has sold about 30 aircraft a year on average worldwide and has made approximately 250 deliveries in total.

The HondaJet Echelon can accommodate up to 11 people up from eight for existing HondaJet models. It also has better fuel efficiency and can fly longer distances compared to competitors' small business jets.

The HondaJet Echelon has a range of about 4,860 kilometers -- 1.7 times that of conventional small business jets -- making it the first small business aircraft capable of flying across North America nonstop.

Honda Aircraft plans to acquire a U.S. certification, which proves the HondaJet Echelon's safety, in 2028 and aims to sell 40 of the aircraft annually.

The aircraft manufacturer plans to increase sales using both conventional aircraft that cost about $7 million (¥1 billion) each and the Echelon. Yamasaki said Honda Aircraft will also increase the number of employees from 1,000 to 1,500 by 2028.

Yamasaki said the company also plans to focus on sales of used aircraft to broaden the base of small business jet users.

Honda Aircraft has been losing money since the company was established in 2006. Its sales volume declined from 2022 to 2023, mainly due to a global shortage of semiconductors amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Yamasaki expects Echelon to be a ""game changer.""

Honda Aircraft's competitors include Textron Aviation Inc., a U.S. company that has Cessna, a well-known brand in Japan, as an affiliated company.

""The technology we have developed as an automobile company will be an advantage for us,"" Yamasaki said, showing his intention to differentiate Honda Aircraft models from its competitors by focusing on comfort and other features.

In recent years, global sales of business jets often used by company executives and wealthy individuals have stayed steady at around 700 a year. About 800 business jets were sold in 2019, but sales have been sluggish partly because of travel restrictions imposed in various countries during the pandemic.

HondaJet enjoys a large share, or about 40%, of the market for very light jets that can accommodate four to eight people.

However, the annual sales volume of the very light jet market is about 60, which is less than 10% of the entire business jet market.

As the annual sales of light jets, which can accommodate about 10 people, is around 170, Honda Aircraft aims to increase its sales by entering the market with the HondaJet Echelon.

Honda Aircraft plans to invest $55.7 million (¥8 billion) to develop the Echelon.

""We would like to emphasize the Echelon's advantage in terms of high fuel efficiency and market it to those who are also interested in decarbonization,"" Yamasaki said.",japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,news,japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,,0.2392156862745098,448919048,1,https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Honda-aircraft-1.jpg,

After the recent surge, XRP fell again, and the long-awaited $1 target remained out of reach. The 1 billion token unlock by Ripple in early March also created significant fear in the market. The subsequent sale of 240 million XRP also caused a stir.

At the time of writing, XRP's price saw a 3.5% increase, moving away from the critical $0.60 level to trade at $0.62.

XRP's market capitalization exceeded $34.5 billion during this period. With this volume, XRP still ranks 6th behind SOL and BNB.

What is the Price of Bonk Coin in Dollars?

With consecutive ATHs seen in BTC, meme coin rises followed in the market. While many meme coins experienced growth, attention suddenly shifted to the meme coins of the Solana network. BONK was one of the most notable among them.

After the market's downturn following the recent ATHs, BONK's gains over the last 30 days reached 100%. BONK, which saw a modest 9% decline over the past 7 days compared to the market, continues to trade at $0.00002299 after a 6.23% increase at the time of writing.

BONK's market capitalization also saw an increase. The volume rose by 8%, reaching the $1.5 billion mark, placing BONK at the 71st position according to Coinmarketcap's volume ranking.

BONK's 24-hour trading volume was also on the decline. After a 34% drop in volume, BONK seemed to be relatively neglected with $124 million in trading interest.

New reports have pulled the curtain back on the complex inner-workings of game development at the industry's former-largest independent publisher, Activision Blizzard. On top of layoffs, a new compensation plan at Blizzard has further stressed developers. The plan has changed the way developers receive their bonuses (if at all).

The new policy was instituted in 2023. Before the change, Blizzard would dole out bonuses to all employees based on the overall success of the publisher. If Blizzard's earnings were up, then everyone would get a bonus. The new policy only gives bonuses to the teams that are successful. For instance, in 2023, Diablo IV generated $666 million in just 5 days via game sales alone. The Diablo team's success doesn't affect other teams within the confines of the newer bonus scheme.

Sources have told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier that Overwatch 2 developers have not received their second round of bonuses due to the game's overall performance on the market. The sequel's launch was controversial and led to lower-than-expected revenues. Overwatch 2 didn't make enough profit to trigger Blizzard's bonus compensation strategy, which allows for up to 2 bonuses per year based on how well the teams have done.

For reference, Activision's earnings records show that Blizzard made a record-breaking $409 million in operating profit throughout Q2 2023, and potentially pointing to 2023 delivering a new annual profit high for the games division.",tweaktown.com,news,TweakTown,Derek Strickland,0.3490196078431373,448918869,1,https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/7/97054_21_overwatch-2-bombed-so-blizzard-employees-wont-receive-bonuses_full.jpg,eng-9419060

We want to strongly encourage President Biden to also set the highest standards for community development in the U.S. government's support for private sector initiatives. Otherwise, the outcomes may be negative. In African countries, infrastructure development particularly in railroads are often designed to facilitate extractive industry exports. All too often extractive industries leave the communities in which they are implanted worse off economically, often leading to youth alienation and even violent extremism. It is imperative that the U.S. government set the highest standards for community development for private sector companies that it is leveraging to obtain its development objectives. Engaging communities through participatory approaches commonly used in the field of Social and Behavior Change will help to ensure effective community development and measurable human-centered outcomes.

We draw upon our past research on the situation in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado Province where the American petroleum company, Anadarko, and the British ruby-mining firm Gemsfield seriously underperformed in their relations with the local communities, thus helping to give rise to a Islamist violent extremist organization (VEO) that led to the intense suffering of the local populations and the failure of Anadarko (and its successor company TotalEnergies) from achieving its goal of constructing a $20 billion Liquified Natural Gas facility. The U.S. government once touted the LNG project as the largest ever private sector investment in Africa. This is, by the way, a project for which the U.S. Export Import Bank made a direct loan of $5 billion dollars during the Trump administration in spite of the fact that the VEO had already been active for two years. The terrorist attacks unleashed by the Islamist VEO forced TotalEnergies to stop its operations and declare Force Majeure, which means that TotalEnergies does not have to adhere to its contractual obligations, and it informed the Export Import bank that it had ceased operations.

The US government under President Biden faces a complex world in disorder, where the challenges of climate change, the erosion of democratic values, and international economic and military rivalries especially with China continue to mount. Addressing these problems requires innovative thinking and a clear-headed vision of the type of world new order that must be put into place if communities everywhere are to buy into the emerging new vision offered by the United States.

In his speech to the 2023 United Nations General Assembly, President Biden articulated his foreign policy vision for a more constructive way forward. He pointed to a strong role for private sector investment in his foreign policy vision, especially in infrastructure development: Through strategic, targeted public investments, we can unlock enormous amounts of private-sector financing, more than $30 billion to date.

President Biden highlighted his administration's support for one such infrastructure project extending the Angolan Lobito railway into mineral rich regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia. Private sector investment in infrastructure, including this one, is often designed to support the export of valuable minerals especially to counter China's established advantages in controlling these resources, especially those needed to make the transition to more climate-friendly economies.

We want to caution President Biden, however, that despite the potential benefits of international private-sector investments, such investments can easily backfire unless they are accompanied by a commitment to promote community development centered on proven community empowerment approaches. Our study of the failings of American and British investments in the extractive industry in Mozambique indicate that private sector investments can fail miserably, to the detriment both of the corporations and of local communities. It is critical to learn from such past failings to prevent similar negative outcomes in the future.

President Biden and his administration need to require U.S. international corporations to engage in community empowerment best practices as they implement their investments in disparate communities. Above all, private sector representatives must overcome top-down thinking that too often carry with it cultural biases that distort investors' perceptions of the priorities of local communities.

Community empowerment approaches contribute to the upliftment of people everywhere and will counter the growing stigmatization of western investors including U.S.-based corporations as only concerned with shareholder profits. Concern for communities when supporting private sector investment in foreign lands will be critical to adding a bottom-up perspective to U.S. foreign policy that too remains largely top-down.

One of the exceptions to the top-down foreign policy approach, which contains a lot of elite and cultural biases, is the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Very often, USAID personnel and implementing partners assure that public investment in the development arena are bottom-up with considerable emphasis on monitoring and evaluation to ensure improved outcomes. This bottom-up perspective also needs to be consistently adopted as part of the private sector's corporate social responsibility practices as wells as part of U.S. foreign policy more generally.

One thing is clear: U.S. foreign policy cannot repeat the same policy formulations expecting different, more positive outcomes. Foreign service personnel will also need to re-examine the way that foreign policy decisions are made so that they are more inclusive of a bottom-up vision. However, a shift to more effective foreign policy approaches may be particularly difficult to achieve. In part, this is due to the fact Washington insiders often engaged in group think reinforced by bureaucratic structures -- with a hesitancy of foreign service personnel to question the policy decisions of higher ups.

The foreign policy establishment would likely benefit from adopting stronger Red Teaming approaches such as those used by the U.S. military that seek to recognize and mitigate the negative effects of insider group dynamics, including, but not limited to, Groupthink and the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities. Obviously, we as authors need to be held to the same standards in our analysis.

We have investigated and studied in depth the impact of U.S. and other western investments in Mozambique's northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, and it is clear that private-sector investment strategies that neglected the perspectives and needs of the local populations contributed significantly to the rise and expansion of a violent extremist jihadist movement. The emergence of this Violent Extremist Organization (VEO) known locally as the Machababos or ""The Youth"" led to intense suffering of the local population. More than 1,000,000 people have been internally displaced, economic and social life gravely disrupted, and an estimated 4,000 lives lost, over 40% of which are civilians.

The emergence of violent extremism in Cabo Delgado occurred against a backdrop of increasing foreign economic engagement in the region, particularly by the British firm, Gemsfield, and the U.S. petroleum company, Anadarko, both of which alienated communities that they impacted.

Surprisingly, the intense suffering of the local communities had already been well established when in early 2020 a U.S. government official during the Trump administration heralded the investment by Anadarko in Mozambique as the largest investment ever on the African continent ($30 billion). The Acting Undersecretary for International Trade Administration, Joseph Semsar, stated the Anadarko deal would drive growth and job creation in Mozambique, other African countries, and in the United States. Semsar highlighted the role of the U.S. Commerce Department in supporting major elements of the LNG project.

Anadarko had obtained concessions from the Mozambican government to construct and operate one of the world's largest Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plants to be fed by offshore gas production and the development of a port capable of harboring vessels specially designed to transport LNG. As part of its engagement, Anadarko said that it sought to have a positive impact for the local communities so that the company could enjoy good community relations, contribute positively to the stabilization of the region, and enjoy a more secure work environment.

However, something went terribly wrong; neither Sesmar's nor Andarko's rosy prognostications came true. Conversations with local community members painted a different picture. The social disruptions provoked by land appropriation and population resettlement investments by Anadarko became drivers of VEO recruitment.

The development of the LNG project entailed the resettlement of thousands of farmers and fishing people from the Afungi peninsula in the Palma District of Cabo Delgado Province. Anadarko's stated goal was to oversee resettlement in a way that restored or improved the standard of living of those displaced. Despite these stated good intentions, interviews with civic leaders in Palma District revealed that some of the ""resettled"" youth joined the ranks of the Machababos.

Interviewees in the city of Palma spoke of widespread dissatisfaction with the implementation of the resettlement program and the impact this had on communities in the area. Local community leaders complained of the diversion of funds intended to assist the displaced population, inadequate payment for land, and no compensation for their investment in fruit-producing trees. Moreover, resettled households were mixed in with communities that they did not know - with huge negative implications in the local cultural context. Those interviewed also reported that those engaged in fishing were often settled inland and as a result lost their source of livelihood.

Accordingly, despite the billions of dollars invested by this major American oil and gas company in the region, the perception was that there has been little benefit to the local community members, most of whom are Muslim. Instead, resettlement efforts precipitated negative sentiments and heightened both short-term and long-term security risks.

We brought to the attention of a high-ranking Anadarko representative working in Mozambique the fact that the resettlement project was having a negative impact on the local population. We also underscored the importance of adopting a community participatory approach to the resettlement process. The Anadarko representative -an American - responded by saying that that sounds expensive and that perhaps USAID would be better suited to carry out such an approach down the line.

While Anadarko began to implement its resettlement plans in 2017, human rights abuses attributed to private security forces hired by Gemfields, which holds a ruby-mining concession, reportedly fueled the armed Islamist group's first attacks in the town of Mocímboa da Praia in October 2017. In Montepuez District where Gemfields ruby mining concession is located, private security actors working on behalf of Gemfields' interests allegedly destroyed property of artisanal miners operating in the concession area and tortured and killed some residents, many of whom were artisanal miners, to force them to leave the company's concession area. That district is home to the world's largest ruby reserves. It should be noted that in accordance with Mozambican laws, Mozambicans living on their ancestral lands have no legal title to these lands and the Mozambican government can concede the lands to business interests like Gemfields and Anadarko.

According to an Imam in Mocimboa de Praia, the Machababos were able to take advantage of the violence of the private security forces to initiate recruitment for its own violent actions. Those espousing a radical jihadist ideological narrative in the region were able to capitalize on alienation especially of youth and the violence committed by private security forces by transforming these very real grievances into narratives of revenge that gave rise to violent extremist actions. In several other African contexts, VEOs have exploited the victims of violence often by state actors into a posture of vengeance to provide a moral justification for violent acts against others. It should also be noted that Gemsfields's top executive reached out to us to deny that there was any linkage between events in their concession area and the rise of violent extremism.

The London-based law firm, Leigh Day, filed a lawsuit against Gemfields in British courts; the lawsuit was brought by 273 artisanal miners over accusations of abuse at the Gemsfields' ruby mine. Gemfields settled the case in 2019 by agreeing to a payout of £5.8 million to the aggrieved miners, while denying liability.

In 2019, the insurgent leaders pledged allegiance to Islamic State, though the linkages with the international movement often appear tenuous at best.

To make a long story short: Another American firm, Occidental Petroleum, acquired Anadarko Petroleum in 2019; Occidental then sold Anadarko's African assets in the same year to the French firm, Total- later called TotalEnergies. In the deal, TotalEnergies inherited the Anadarko LNG project as well as the insecurity of Cabo Delgado Province.

The onshore LNG project taken over by TotalEnergies suffered from actions by the VEO in the nearby town of Palma in March 2021. Nearly 1,200 local residents and around 55 Total contractors were killed, according to a journalistic investigation of the impact. In response TotalEnergies stopped all its operations and declared a Force Majeure - a legal principle that allowed TotalEnergies from fulfilling its contractual obligations due to unforeseeable circumstances. While this article was being written, TotalEnergies was indicating that it would resume operations in Cabo Delgado sometime in early 2024, then a week later, it was reported that development of the LNG would begin afresh in July 2024, and more recently it announced that operations would not begin again before the end of 2024.

From the beginning of the insurgency, the Mozambique government's response to the deteriorating security situation focused on finding a quick military solution, but the government soon realized that its army and local police forces lacked sufficient capacity to suppress or defeat the extremists. The U.S. Army has provided limited training to the Mozambique military in an effort to improve its fighting capacity. Meanwhile, looking for a quick solution, by 2019 the Mozambican government called upon and accepted offers by a litany of private military companies (PMCs) that failed miserably to help the Mozambique government to counter the Machababos extremist threat.

Given this operational environment, Erik Prince, founder of the American PMC, Blackwater, and owner of the China-headquartered Frontier Services Group (FSG) sought to provide a force in Mozambique to assist the military in fighting the insurgents. By mid-2019, Erik Prince supplied two helicopters and support crews for the Mozambican military. Our informants tell us that in addition to payments, Prince was reportedly seeking land concessions from the Mozambican government for the military support he was hoping to supply. However, at the same time, the government was already considering Russia's private mercenary force, the Wagner Group for help. In September 2019, it was reported the Wagner Group secured the contract after winning a ""bidding war"" that included Erik Prince's FSG and various other contractors. As a result, Erik Prince withdrew his helicopters in mid-September 2019 before being replaced by nearly 170 Russian Wagner Group fighters. At that time, Yevgeny Prigozhin headed Wagner Group; he was the St. Petersburg oligarch who at the time was so close to the Kremlin that he was known as President Vladimir Putin's ""chef,"" that is, until his 2023 assassination in Russia following a Wagner rebellion against the Russian government in the context of Russia's aggression in Ukraine.

The full Wagner contingent arrived in September 2019; this was the same month the U.S. Export Import Bank approved its $5 billion loan. Prigozhin forces included nearly 200 fighters, trucks, drones and a Mi-17 helicopter gunship. Soon after their arrival, Wagner forces were plagued by setbacks which included sustained casualties from Machababos ambushes. By November, the Wagner Group's inability to combat and contain the Machababos insurgency led to their humiliating withdrawal from the region, having suffered a reported nine fatalities. Later, John Gartner, CEO of a small South African PMC, OAM, made an unsuccessful bid to the government of Mozambique, and commented that that the Wagner Group failed due to their lack of knowledge of the area and ""bush-fighting"" techniques.

By April 2020, the government of Mozambique hired the South African Dyck Advisory Group (DAG), a PMC, owned by Lionel Dyck, to provide air support to Mozambique's defense forces in the fight against the extremists in Cabo Delgado. However, within two weeks into their deployment, the insurgents managed to shoot down two DAG helicopters. Given this poor start, it appears DAG operations had not done any better than other, previous, PMCs. But by July 2020, the Mozambique government renewed DAG's contract and expanded it to include training ground troops.

In March 2021, DAG found itself in serious trouble, facing allegations of violating humanitarian law. A March 2, 2021 Amnesty International report accused DAG of firing indiscriminately at civilians and dropping hand grenades from the helicopters that it deployed. The report also stated that any failure, by those conducting the attacks, to distinguish between civilians and fighters ""is a violation of international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime."" Other reports stated that the DAG forces dropped improvised bombs on civilian populations. On March 23, 2021, the Mozambican Center for Democracy and Development -- a civil society organization -- called for DAG's contract not to be renewed. On April 6, 2021, DAG ended its involvement, including its helicopter support.

After April 2021, another South African defense contractor with headquarters in Abu Dahbi, the Paramount Group provided helicopter air support to the Mozambican military helicopters that were flown by Mozambican pilots trained by Paramount and its partner company, Burnham Global.

The failures of the PMCs such as Erik Prince's FSG, Wagner, DAG, Paramount, and even the Mozambique military to counter or contain the Machababos's ambitious insurgency became quite evident to the government of Mozambique. This led Mozambique to adopt by late 2021/2022 a more regionally coordinated and comprehensive approach to counter the insurgents in hopes of applying a more successful strategy to defeat or counter the extremist insurgents. In response, the Southern African Development Community dispatched a regional fighting force composed largely of some 1,500 South African troops. In a separate effort, Rwanda deployed a 3,000 combat-ready force that appears to focus on creating an operationally secure zone for the French TotalEnergies onshore LNG facility.

Many observers believe that the French government played a major role in securing Rwanda's protection for TotalEnergies facility. In this context, the French government worked to overcome its strained relations with the Rwandan government. President Macron visited the Rwandan capital, Kigali, made up with his Rwandan counterpart, and announced 370 million euros in fresh French development aid to Rwanda. In addition, with strong French backing, the European Union Peace Facility Fund has provided 35 million euros in support of the Rwanda and Southern African forces operating in Cabo Delgado.

The South African and Rwandan forces appear to have managed to contain the VEO's actions, but in the coastal area. It is often difficult to ascertain the security situation because of limitations placed on independent journalists and civil society groups that might report on events in Cabo Delgado. Yet, sources on the ground and most recently Vatican News reported an uptick in violent acts by the Machababos in 2024. And there are reports that of insurgent activity spreading south into Nampula Province.

Regardless the current state of the insurgency, the VEO has had a serious impact on this $20 billion investment. For instance, as TotalEnergies announced its plan to end the Force Majeure and return to operations, the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina took advantage of the Force Majeure to cancel its 20-year contract to purchase liquid natural gas (LNG) from TotalEnergies-led LNG project. According to press reports, Peramina was to have imported one million tons of LNG per year from the Cabo Delgado facility. In addition, in October 2023, survivors and relatives of victims of the 2021 insurgent in Palma filed a complaint against TotalEnergies for negligence and indirect manslaughter, saying the company had failed to ensure the safety of subcontractors. TotalEnergies rejected the allegations, saying they were ""inaccurate.""

The instability in Cabo Delgado has also on occasion brought to a halt the mining and transport of graphite, much of which is destined for Tesla's electronic vehicle battery facility located in the U.S. state, Louisiana. An Australian firm, Syrah, is mining the graphite destined for Tesla; the graphite production in Syrah's Cabo Delgato mine is critical for breaking China's near monopoly over the supply of minerals for EV battery production, so much so that in September 2023, the U.S. government's International Development Finance Corporation gave tentative approval of a $150 million loan to a Syrah subsidiary operating in Mozambique.

If the US government intention is to leverage the private sector for development in lower- and middle-income countries for both the upliftment of the host economies and for American manufacturing, the U.S. government must ensure that these corporations adopt social responsibility approaches that are truly effective.

To minimize the chances of private-sector investments fueling alienation, discontent and conflict, it is important to apply evidence-driven best practices for community engagement and social investment as part of a conflict prevention strategy. Proven methodologies from the field of Social and Behavior Change Communication, structured on community participation approaches, have proven quite capable of restoring trust between governments and society, and of improving development outcomes. Local traditional leaders, women's groups, youth groups and other civic organizations must be at the table when decisions about community development such as access to quality healthcare delivery, education, economic infrastructure, access to markets, employment, etc. are made. Indeed, such techniques have been used in the past in Cabo Delgado to effectively combat the illegal timber industry through community buy-in into the effort.

Our study of the conditions that have given rise to violent solutions to addressing social and economic grievances indicates that to restore trust in public institutions and loyalty to the state, it is necessary to invest in developing capacity of communities to manage their affairs, especially through community participation in the delivery of public services such as healthcare, education, agricultural/fishing extension and access to markets for goods. Communities must be involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of interventions that are supposed to benefit them. In addition, leaders from affected local communities have to be involved in finding enduring solutions to the social conflicts that have arisen.

It appears that in Cabo Delgado Province the unsuccessful strategies of companies and non-government organizations contracted to facilitate sustainable development in communities impacted by corporate investment have either not used or unsuccessfully implemented informed, evidence-driven practices and methodologies. The adoption of state-of-the-art techniques including rigorous monitoring and evaluation (M&E) methods can help assure that objectives are being reached, and if not, corrective actions can be taken. Sharing M&E findings with governments and in-country non-governmental organizations contracted to help corporations meet their social responsibilities goals will help keep all pertinent actors on track and on the straight and narrow.

With the private sector implementing these proven approaches, national and local governments can be held to higher standards. It will help to ensure that the revenues provided to governments by the private sector are delivering goods and services to communities. This will help ensure that funds are not diverted into the hands of members of the political elite but rather benefit the public.

Without international investors, the international donor community and state actors applying a community participatory approach to public service delivery and creation of livelihood opportunities, local resistance and conflict are likely to undermine achieving the desired results. The intentional application of evidence-driven practices reduces the risk of project under-delivery both from an economic and reputational perspective for all parties.

In addition to the suffering of local communities and corporate setbacks, the emergence of a VEO that derives from failed corporate social responsibility efforts creates the opening for outside state and non-state actors as well as factions of a country's political elite to leverage VEOs of all kinds to achieve specific political and economic goals to the detriment of investing firms. For instance, the withdrawal of the oil majors from onshore petroleum and gas exploration in Nigeria's Niger Delta is an example of how local and international interests, including Russian enterprises, combined to exploit and foment local grievances to drive out Western companies.

In the case of Mozambique, the Islamic State - a non-state actor -- laid claimed the Machababos as part of its organization and takes credit for Machababos ""successes."" It may be also important to point out that there have been unconfirmed rumors that a Middle East petroleum producing country has provided financial support to the Machababos as a means of preventing the LNG project from becoming operational so as to stop the LNG project's considerable future output from contributing to a lowering of global LNG prices.

Responsible private investment requires proven community participatory approaches, and the Biden Administration could set a strong example by insisting upon the application of effective community development approaches in order to receive U.S. Government support for private sector investments.

The latest industry data released by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) revealed that active subscriptions across the four mobile networks of MTN, Airtel, Globacom, and 9mobile stood at 224.4 million as of December 2023.

With the decline in actively connected lines recorded by the operators, the country's teledensity, which measures the number of active telephone connections per 100 inhabitants living within an area, also declined to 100.75 in January 2024 from 103.66% recorded in December last year.

According to NCC, the teledensity is calculated based on a population estimate of 190 million.

Analysis of the industry data shows that the decline in the country's mobile subscription database was caused mainly by MTN, which lost 7.2 million subscriptions in the month.

The company's total active subscriptions, which stood at 87 million in December 2023, plunged to 79.7 million in January, according to NCC's data.

The New York Times reported that veterinarians are inching closer to providing individualized care for Southern Resident killer whales thanks to a combination of specialized drones, infrared cameras, and directional microphones that can pick up the sound of their breathing.

""When we started out, it was a pretty far-fetched idea to say, 'We're going to do veterinary exams on wild, free-swimming orcas, and they won't even know we're doing it.' It's not far-fetched anymore,"" Dr. Hendrik Nollens, the vice president of wildlife health for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told the outlet.

Scientists had already had success monitoring larger whales with drones used to collect breath samples, but because orcas release smaller clouds of mist from their blowholes, the technology reportedly had to be adapted with the help of computational modeling.

Experts at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance tested a prototype at SeaWorld and on other whale populations with success before deploying an upgraded drone-petri dish combo on the orcas, enlisting the help of identification expert and scientist Maya Sears.

Ultimately, a test allowed researchers to assess a specifically selected orca for bacterial and fungal infections and conclude that unusual readings were likely the result of a minor injury that resolved itself.

Southern Residents, which swim in the Pacific waters off the United States and British Columbia coast, have been on the endangered list since 2005, and now, roughly 75 of the marine creatures remain.

""We're in a dire, dire situation,"" said Dr. Joe Gaydos, the science director of UC Davis marine conservation program SeaDoc Society. ""We're at that point where the health of every single individual is important.""

Like with other orca populations, pollution has contributed to the Southern Residents' fight for survival. Boat traffic and declining numbers of salmon have also negatively impacted the orcas, but there are factors under investigation, per the Times.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration listed lingering chemical contaminants as one major point of concern, and the effects of microplastics are still being looked into. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, 14 million tons of plastic find their way into oceans every year.

While changing our relationship with plastic can reduce the amount of waste polluting our waters, scientists are hopeful that their new tools will further aid conservation efforts and lead to more knowledge about how to help the Southern Residents.

""We're not at the point yet that we could say, 'Oh, and here's my diagnosis, and here's my prescription and treatment,'"" Dr. Nollens explained to the Times and added that the scientists' ability to quickly evaluate an orca in the wild was an important ""milestone.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.2862745098039217,448918344,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lE_b8HLCjB0u_R7WczJb0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d80a26e815b8fd171182951da53016d4,

The moment has come.

Singapore's government has announced a tax on air fares to fund purchases of pricey sustainable aviation fuel, while neighboring Malaysia has authorized carriers to charge people a carbon levy from next month.

In Europe, airlines this year lose one quarter of their free emissions allowance, the first in a series of reductions that's already estimated to be adding to ticket prices.

""We've entered a new era,"" said Rico Luman, a transport, logistics and automotive economist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. ""Flying will turn more expensive.""

While the policies differ from country to country, the common goal is to clean up an aviation industry that for a century has relied on fossil fuels to function. Airline chiefs fret that unless they show they're serious about cutting emissions right now, they'll face fines, flying limits or - worst of all - be grounded completely.

Sustainable aviation fuel, a cleaner-burning liquid made from waste oils or agricultural feedstock, is the industry's primary means of reaching its 2050 net zero target. But the new fuel is in short supply and can be more than double the price of normal jet kerosene, leaving airlines little choice but to pass the cost onto passengers.

It means little price respite for flyers who've been whacked by soaring prices since air travel resumed after the pandemic. Now, they'll have to pay to neutralize aviation's carbon footprint, too.

""That change is expensive,"" Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand Ltd.'s chief sustainability officer, said in an interview this week. ""We do need to start talking to Kiwis about what flying is doing, why it's impactful, why we've got to change.""

Air New Zealand wants sustainable fuel to account for around 20% of its total fuel consumption by 2030, one of the most ambitious targets of its kind anywhere in the world. Delta Air Lines Inc., Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., and Qantas Airways Ltd. are among those with a 10% target by the end of the decade.

Singapore, Malaysia

Sustainable aviation fuel can cut emissions by as much as 80%. The greener fuel is essential to reduce emissions from long-haul flights, the source of most air-travel pollution, because electric planes don't have sufficient range. Hydrogen propulsion isn't expected to make a meaningful impact for decades.

With time running out, air-travel levies or mandates to buy or supply sustainable aviation fuel are rippling across the globe from Japan and Singapore to the European Union and the UK. The measures are designed to forcefully accelerate emissions reductions and assure green fuel suppliers that there will be buyers for their new, relatively expensive product.

""Voluntary measures have largely failed,"" said Dan Rutherford, director of research at the International Council on Clean Transportation. The most effective policies are those that apply equally to all airlines instead of singling out carriers from a certain country, he said.

Singapore, for instance, aims to have all departing flights take off with 1% sustainable aviation fuel in jets' tanks from 2026, rising to between 3% and 5% by 2030. The levy will vary depending on the length of the flight and the class of travel. An economy flight to London in 2026 would rise by S$16 ($12) under the policy.

Malaysia will in April allow airlines flying in and out of Kuala Lumpur to impose a carbon levy, either to pay for sustainable fuel or to fund carbon offsets. Details of the policy appeared in a local Bernama media report this month that was later confirmed by the transport ministry.

Under the European Union's ReFuelEU initiative, conventional jet kerosene must be blended with 2% sustainable aviation fuel in 2025, gradually increasing to 70% by 2050. The UK also plans to mandate SAF use next year.

It's not just the price of fuel that passengers will absorb. The cost of buying new, less-thirsty aircraft is also dripping down into fares. Qantas, which has started to receive the first of dozens of next-generation planes on order, last week said it's raising fares on most domestic routes by an average of 2% to 3%.

Price hikes

According to ING's Luman, this year's reduction to aviation's free emissions allowance in the EU may be adding €8 ($8.75) to the price of a return flight between London and Rome. The extra cost would be more than €30 in 2026 at current carbon prices, he said. Luman cautioned that it's hard to isolate the precise impact of the policy because other factors including a lack of capacity are also pushing up fares.

The International Air Transport Association calculates that aviation's transition to net zero will require investment of as much as $5 trillion through 2050. Even those with the most to lose are acknowledging that passengers can't escape the bill.

""It pains me to suggest that travelers are going to have to pay more,"" Margy Osmond, chief executive officer of Tourism &amp; Transport Forum Australia, said at a renewable aviation fuels conference in Canberra this week. ""There's going to be an additional cost to aviation. That's all there is to it.""",stripes.com,news,Stars and Stripes,,-0.07450980392156858,448918255,1,https://www.stripes.com/incoming/vg9n6w-291655201_10158773872005777_5833061371010134015_n.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/291655201_10158773872005777_5833061371010134015_n.jpg,

The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotosho, said this in a statement to update residents on the return of the markets on Sunday, after their debut on March 17.

The discount markets for foodstuff (Ounje Eko) are part of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu's measures rolled out to cushion the effect of petrol subsidy removal on residents.

Mixed reactions had trailed the prices and other logistics at the markets when residents visited them on their first Sunday of operation.

The pilot scheme began with sales of discounted food items, such as rice, beans, garri, bread, eggs, and perishables like tomato, pepper and onions.

Omotosho said that activities in each market were being coordinated by government officials, youth volunteers and private-sector payment solution providers, to ensure seamless operations.

He reiterated that Gov. Sanwo-Olu rolled out the initiative, amongst others, to impact lives in various sectors of the economy.

The commissioner said that a new market location had also been introduced in Lekki Phase 1 to cater to the needs of residents within the area.

He said that the detailed locations of Ounje Èkó markets could be found on all Lagos State Government social media platforms.

Residents had on March 17 trooped out in large numbers to the centres of ""Ounje Eko,"" Lagos Discounted Food programme, to purchase food items at cheaper prices.

Residents arrived as early as 6.00 a.m. at Lagos Progressive Junior Secondary School, Surulere, to benefit from the discounted food programme.

The programme, which was meant to start at 11.00 a.m., started one hour late due to unavailability of vouchers.

Mrs Abimbola Kanwei, a 70-year-old, urged the government to adopt a better approach going forward as residents queued under the sun for hours before they could buy the food items.

This move is aimed at promoting trust, transparency, and collaborative development within the community.

By making the code for its Orb eye scanners accessible to anyone, the platform intends to encourage further advancements in the technology. The open-sourcing initiative builds upon previous steps taken by Worldcoin, including the release of the iris code late last year and the opening up of hardware nearly a year ago.

This strategic approach not only fosters trust and verifiability but also invites developer communities to contribute to the ongoing evolution of the technology. Worldcoin, a separate crypto project from OpenAI, was launched in January 2023 under the name ""Tools for Humanity"" by Sam Altman and Alex Blania. Its primary objective is to establish a global identification standard that validates ""personhood"" to combat bot activity.

In July, the platform introduced its WLD token on the Optimism mainnet, marking a significant milestone in its development. The cornerstone of Worldcoin's technology is the Orb, which utilizes iris scans to create a unique ""fingerprint"" called the IrisCode. This data is then securely stored on Worldcoin's blockchain, forming the basis of a WorldID linked to each user.

The project has faced scrutiny and controversy regarding its eye-scanning technology, particularly concerning user privacy and security. One of the concerns raised by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is the potential vulnerability if a malicious actor gains access to Orb manufacturing or hacking capabilities. This could lead to the generation of fake iris scan hashes and unauthorized creation of World IDs, posing a significant security risk.

Addressing these concerns, Worldcoin emphasizes that privacy and security have always been top priorities in developing the Orb. The foundation is actively conducting audits and has committed to maintaining a high level of transparency regarding privacy and security practices. Despite the challenges and controversies, Worldcoin has also forged partnerships and collaborations. In February, blockchain-based esports platform Community Gaming announced its integration of Worldcoin's WorldID to detect cheaters effectively.

It's worth noting that the Worldcoin Orb is not mandatory for Community Gaming's WorldID integration, providing users with flexibility in adopting the technology. Following the announcement of the open-sourcing initiative for its Orb technology, Worldcoin's WLD cryptocurrency experienced a notable price increase of nearly 4% to $8.40. However, the cryptocurrency market's overall volatility has led to fluctuations of up to 10% within the past 24 hours, reflecting broader market trends impacting digital asset prices.

Worldcoin Foundation's decision to open-source core components of its Orb technology marks a significant step towards enhancing trust, transparency, and collaborative development within the crypto community. While challenges persist, the foundation remains committed to addressing privacy and security concerns while pursuing partnerships to drive innovation in digital identity solutions.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.2784313725490195,448917949,10,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

This innovation, detailed in npj Spintronics, paves the way for advanced neuromorphic devices capable of high-speed operations and applications in fields like weather forecasting and speech recognition.

Researchers from Tohoku University have created a theoretical framework for an advanced spin wave reservoir computing (RC) system that leverages spintronics. This innovation advances the field toward realizing energy-efficient, nanoscale computing with unparalleled computational power.

Details of their findings were published in npj Spintronics on March 1, 2024.

The brain is the ultimate computer and scientists are constantly striving to create neuromorphic devices that mimic the brain's processing capabilities, low power consumption, and its ability to adapt to neural networks. The development of neuromorphic computing is revolutionary, allowing scientists to explore nanoscale realms, GHz speed, with low energy consumption.

In recent years, many advances in computational models inspired by the brain have been made. These artificial neural networks have demonstrated extraordinary performances in various tasks. However, current technologies are software-based; their computational speed, size, and energy consumption remain constrained by the properties of conventional electric computers.

RC works via a fixed, randomly generated network called the 'reservoir.' The reservoir enables the memorization of past input information and its nonlinear transformation. This unique characteristic allows for the integration of physical systems, such as magnetization dynamics, to perform various tasks for sequential data, like time-series forecasting and speech recognition.

Some have proposed spintronics as a means to realize high-performance devices. But devices produced so far have failed to live up to expectations. In particular, they have failed to achieve high performance at nanoscales with GHz speed.

""Our study proposed a physical RC that harnessed propagating spin waves,"" says Natsuhiko Yoshinaga, co-author of the paper and associate professor at the Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR). ""The theoretical framework we developed utilized response functions that link input signals to propagating spin dynamics. This theoretical model elucidated the mechanism behind the high performance of spin wave RC, highlighting the scaling relationship between wave speed and system size to optimize the effectiveness of virtual nodes.""

Crucially, Yoshinaga and his colleagues helped clarify the mechanism for high-performance reservoir computing. In doing so, they harnessed various subfields, namely condensed matter physics and mathematical modeling.

""By employing the unique properties of spintronics technology, we have potentially paved the way for a new era of intelligent computing, leading us closer to realizing a physical device that can be put to use in weather forecasts and speech recognition"" adds Yoshinaga.

During a fireside chat at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, Wood referred to Bitcoin as a ""financial super highway,"" emphasizing its significant use cases in such regions.

Ark Invest, where Cathie Wood holds a prominent position, recently entered the market as one of the issuers of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) known as ARKB. This move underscores Ark Invest's strategic focus on emerging markets and the broader global macroeconomic environment, which has recently been impacted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates.

Wood's observations about Bitcoin's relevance in emerging markets were particularly highlighted by the example of Nigeria. The country has emerged as one of the largest adopters of Bitcoin due to the considerable depreciation of its national currency. This scenario illustrates Bitcoin's dual nature as both a risk-off and a risk-on asset, showcasing its adaptability and appeal across various market conditions.

The success of Ark's spot bitcoin ETF, ARKB, since its inception, has been notable within the landscape of newly introduced bitcoin ETFs. Wood's comments at the conference also touched upon the growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space, which mathematically suggests a potential for Bitcoin's price to exceed $3.5 million. While she refrained from providing a specific new price target during the chat, Wood did reference her earlier prediction of a $1.5 million price target for Bitcoin.

Looking ahead, Wood expressed a positive outlook regarding Bitcoin's future trajectory. She emphasized that despite its current value, Bitcoin still possesses significant untapped potential for further growth. This sentiment aligns with the evolving narrative around Bitcoin as a pivotal asset class with substantial utility and investment allure, particularly in the context of emerging markets and shifting global economic dynamics.

Wood's insights underscore the expanding role of Bitcoin as a financial tool that transcends traditional boundaries, enabling seamless transactions and investments on a global scale.

This innovation advances the field toward realizing energy-efficient, nanoscale computing with unparalleled computational power.

Details of their findings were published in npj Spintronics on March 1, 2024.

The brain is the ultimate computer and scientists are constantly striving to create neuromorphic devices that mimic the brain's processing capabilities, low power consumption, and its ability to adapt to neural networks. The development of neuromorphic computing is revolutionary, allowing scientists to explore nanoscale realms, GHz speed, with low energy consumption.

In recent years, many advances in computational models inspired by the brain have been made. These artificial neural networks have demonstrated extraordinary performances in various tasks. However, current technologies are software-based; their computational speed, size, and energy consumption remain constrained by the properties of conventional electric computers.

RC works via a fixed, randomly generated network called the 'reservoir.' The reservoir enables the memorization of past input information and its nonlinear transformation. This unique characteristic allows for the integration of physical systems, such as magnetization dynamics, to perform various tasks for sequential data, like time-series forecasting and speech recognition.

Some have proposed spintronics as a means to realize high-performance devices. But devices produced so far have failed to live up to expectations. In particular, they have failed to achieve high performance at nanoscales with GHz speed.

""Our study proposed a physical RC that harnessed propagating spin waves,"" says Natsuhiko Yoshinaga, co-author of the paper and associate professor at the Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR). ""The theoretical framework we developed utilized response functions that link input signals to propagating spin dynamics. This theoretical model elucidated the mechanism behind the high performance of spin wave RC, highlighting the scaling relationship between wave speed and system size to optimize the effectiveness of virtual nodes.""

Crucially, Yoshinaga and his colleagues helped clarify the mechanism for high-performance reservoir computing. In doing so, they harnessed various subfields, namely condensed matter physics and mathematical modeling.

""By employing the unique properties of spintronics technology, we have potentially paved the way for a new era of intelligent computing, leading us closer to realizing a physical device that can be put to use in weather forecasts and speech recognition"" adds Yoshinaga.

However, apprehensions loom as analysts fear that the stringent policy demands attached to the bailout may exacerbate poverty for millions of Pakistanis.

After five days of negotiations between the IMF and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's newly elected government in Islamabad, a staff-level agreement was reached on the final review of a $3 billion bailout package. Once approved by the fund's executive board, Pakistan will receive the remaining $1.1 billion.

The economic backdrop is dire, with Pakistan currently experiencing a -0.5% economic growth rate and a staggering 25% inflation rate. Compounded by a hefty 22% interest rate, the business climate has suffered, leading to the exodus of multinational companies. Furthermore, the country grapples with depleted foreign exchange reserves and an external debt exceeding $130 billion.

Tabadlab, an Islamabad-based think tank, has painted a grim picture of Pakistan's economic state, dubbing its debt situation a ""raging fire"" far more severe than the IMF's assessment. Warning of an ""inevitable default,"" the report foresees a catastrophic economic spiral.

IMF-imposed reforms in Pakistan's energy sector last year, aimed at addressing a $12.58 billion debt, have already burdened citizens with soaring electricity costs, resulting in record-high inflation of 38%, according to Lahore-based business owner Arsalan Mahmood.

JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. - Leaders with the Directorate of Public Works and the Network Enterprise Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord gathered with JBLM first responders March 14 to celebrate the launch of the base's new state-of-the-art, redundant radio transmission system that brings communications at the installation into a new realm of possibilities.

""By cutting the ribbon today, we are officially declaring the system operational,"" said Amy Ridgeway, director of JBLM's Network Enterprise Center, after cutting the ceremonial ribbon alongside Col. Kent Park, JBLM commander.

With the system operational, JBLM and Yakima Training Center now share the distinction of being independent Trunking Subcores of the Army CONUS Enterprise Land Mobile Radio network (ACE LMR). JBLM has already been host to one of only two core sites for the system, sharing that with Fort Drum in New York.

""Putting this new network into place has been a long time coming, and it is a big deal,"" said David Moylan, project manager for JBLM's NEC planning division. ""We have transitioned from an analog to digital transmission medium and that provides us with a much more secure and robust radio system.""

According to Moylan, the $6.9 million project took four years to fully deploy. Preliminary customer requirement surveys first began in late 2019, and in March 2020 an active contract with Motorola Systems was awarded to migrate to a new infrastructure plan that would support the system. The last step, final system tests, were completed this month.

Now, Moylan said the unified system takes radio communications far beyond what the traditional ""brick"" or walkie-talkie radio systems of the past could ever do.

""Those radios operated on 'line of sight' operability, meaning one user would need to be in the general line of sight of the other,"" Moylan said. ""Now, when I key my mic, I am sending a message on the strongest, most secure channel that is transmitted from tower to tower to tower until it reaches the designated recipient.""

With these capabilities, the system now allows units at JBLM and Yakima Training Center to communicate with each other by radio.

It's a system that has already been utilized by first responders outside of JBLM, and Ridgeway said JBLM first responders can now communicate easily with Washington State Patrol and other local police departments.

""From first responders, military and civilian, to personnel at Madigan and even range control, this unified platform is going to benefit everyone,"" Ridgeway said.",thesubtimes.com,news,The Suburban Times,Joint Base Lewis-McChord,0.2627450980392156,448917491,1,https://thesubtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JBLM-Radio-Transmission-Tower.jpg,

It houses two long-term tenants -- Highland Real Estate, trading as Harcourts, which has ground floor and first floor offices, and Browns Ski Shop, which has operated from ground floor premises since 1980.

Real estate legend, the late Doug Brown, bought the property when it had a fruit shop, and operated his business, Queenstown Real Estate, from there.

Through D.M. Brown Ltd, the property's now held by his four sons, Nigel, Derek, Maurice and Julian, who have decided it's time to pass on the baton.

It's being marketed by local New Zealand Sotheby's International Realty agents Russell Reddell and Matt Finnigan by way of a tender closing next Wednesday.

Reddell says ""the building's stood the test of time and [hosted] multiple businesses and brought millions of dollars into the Queenstown economy over the years, and now it's probably getting to the age where it's ready for a new life and a new look and feel"".

Under its current zoning, a new building could go 12 metres high or a discretionary 14m, and under the proposed district plan ""there's provision for parts of the property to be up to 23m high"", Reddell says.

Both tenants' leases expire in 2027, giving a new owner time to plan any new development -- Reddell suggests those tenants would probably be open to negotiation over carrying on in new premises.

He adds the appeal of the CBD's also increased lately due to infrastructure and street upgrades.

According to the information memorandum, the existing premises are ""under-rented"" -- under 'assessed market rent' it'd be $487,035 plus GST per annum.

Summary

VTEC technology allowed Honda to improve engine performance and fuel economy across various models. The evolution of VTEC engines includes different variations like SOHC VTEC and i-VTEC to enhance efficiency and power. Honda's VTEC engines, famous for durability, efficiency, and high power output, continue to be used in popular models today.

Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control or VTEC (Valve Timing Electronically Controlled) is Honda's version of Variable Valve Timing technology. This system served different purposes in the same engine with increased performance at high RPMs and improved fuel economy at lower RPMs. Honda designed these engines to the very best standard due to the economic boom during the Japanese Bubble Era. VTEC would forever change Honda's trajectory going forward, especially with performance cars.

Although Honda adopted this technology in almost every car at the time, it was the performance cars like the certain variations of the Civic and NSX that really showcased its capability. From performance cars to regular family cars, almost every Honda vehicle adopted this technology. This article is going to take a look at the History of Honda's VTEC engine which is still in use in new cars today. We also take a look at the technology behind it and what happens when ""VTEC kicks in"".

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including Honda, Motortrend and Engineering Explained.

Origin Of VTEC

Close

Japan had a tax that was levied on larger displacement engines: the bigger the engine, the more tax you had to pay. So, Japanese automakers had to find a way to improve the performance and efficiency of their small displacement engines. Turbocharging became popular in cars like the Toyota Supra, Nissan 300ZX, and GT-Rs, while Mazda used the Rotary engine. Honda decided to use valve timing technology to improve its own engines.

Honda's VTEC Technology became popular in the '90s but has been around since 1983. While it was popular in cars, it was first featured on a bike.

Honda introduced the CBR400 sport bike in 1983 and it was the first Honda vehicle to make use of this new technology originally known as HYPER VTEC. It had a 399cc inline-four engine which made 59 horsepower at 13,000 RPM but below 9,500 RPM it made only 46 horsepower.

This was done for better drivability since it gave usable power at lower RPMs but full power at higher RPMs.

The first car to feature this technology was the 1989 Honda Integra XSi with the B16A engines. This was a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated inline-four engine which produced 160 horsepower at 8,200 RPM. It was quite an engineering feat for the Honda team as they hit their goal of 100 horsepower/liter. This power-to-liter figure would set the tone for Honda VTEC engines going forward with each one aiming to have at least 100 horsepower/liter. This was made possible with VTEC and allowed Honda to build a lasting legacy with its VTEC-powered vehicles.

How VTEC Works

The B-series engine was the first Honda engine to feature VTEC and its basic operation is still similar to engines of today. At lower RPM the engine makes use of a mild cam profile and at 5,500 RPM it switches to the aggressive cam profile for more power. According to Honda, here's how it works:

The VTEC engine has a camshaft featuring three different cam lobes for each pair of valves. The two outer cams were tuned for low-end torque and smooth idle, while the center cam was tuned for high-revving horsepower. Each cam had its own rocker arm, but only the outer two actually pressed against the valves, with the central rocker arm assigned only to the center cam. At low engine speeds, the two outer cams are used to open and close the valves, with the center cam inactive, since its rocker arm wasn't directly attached to the valvetrain. As revs increased, the engine computer signaled a spool valve to direct oil pressure to activate a pin that locked the two outer rocker arms to the arm in the center. This forced the two outer arms to act upon the center cam, which featured a longer duration, higher lift, and timing optimized for high-end horsepower.

This has been the basic way a VTEC engine works even to this day. But many improvements have been made since its inception and Honda's VTEC has gotten much better as engine technology improved.

The Rise Of VTEC Engines

Europe got its VTEC engine in the same year it was launched, but not in the Integra. It was used in the Honda Civic and CRX but with a slightly detuned version of the same engine which made 150 horsepower. America's first exposure to VTEC is nothing short of spectacular as it came in what is considered to be Japan's first supercar. The 1991 Acura NSX was the first VTEC-powered vehicle in America, and it was powered by a 3.0 liter V6 and was making 270 horsepower. It didn't hit 100 horsepower/liter but the tradeoff was the most reliable supercar of its time.

This technology was so good that Honda started implementing it in other vehicles in their lineup. Cars like the Honda Prelude, Honda Del Sol, and Acura Integra GSR all made use of VTEC-powered engines. The Integra Type R was the most famous hatchback of its time and made use of one of the best VTEC-powered engines of its time. It used a 1.8-liter B18C engine making 197 horsepower, its horsepower per liter was more than most supercars at the time.

Why VTEC Became Popular

Honda was the first company to create a practical and reliable variable valve timing technology. It was perfected in the '90s and became commercialized for use in Honda Motor vehicles. This led to an industry-wide change for other car companies to follow and Honda's VTEC was ahead of the curve.

But the main reason why these engines were so popular is because they were one of the strongest engines in their class. VTEC helped establish Honda's performance division in the 90s.

Even though these naturally aspirated engines were pushing record numbers per cylinder, they were still highly durable. On the other hand, there was the low fuel consumption of regular commuter vehicles. It was the best of both worlds in one package. This was done at a time when cars were switching to complicated turbocharging methods to make more power. Variable Valve Timing has been available in cars since 1903, but Honda was the first company to make a reliable, durable, and commercially successful engine using this technology. This gave birth to engines like the Honda B-series and K-series engines which were known for making big power from such a tiny unit.

Honda did not just make the best Variable Valve Timing system in the world and decided to go to rest. This was the first iteration of VTEC and future improvements had to be made. The first VTEC engine was introduced as a DOHC (dual overhead camshaft) system in the CBR400 and most early VTEC vehicles. But Honda kept refining this technology and currently has different variations of VTEC.

Variations Of VTEC Engines

As mentioned earlier, the first VTEC that powered the Honda was originally known as HYPER VTEC. However, the production versions used in cars have had different variations over the years. First was the DOHC VTEC which was popular in the 90s, but Honda started creating different versions for even better fuel economy in regular cars. This was used until 2002 and the last car to feature it was the Honda S2000.

SOHC VTEC: This appeared in 1992 in the Honda Civic Si hatchback and EX Sedan. Its function is very similar to the original DOHC version but this was a much simpler setup that was meant for regular passenger cars. Adding VTEC alone raised power from 108 horsepower and 100 pound-feet of torque to 125 horsepower and 106 pound-feet from the previous year. Fuel efficiency also improved from 28/32 MPG to 29/36 MPG.

VTEC-E: This version of VTEC was also introduced in 1992 and the focus was to further improve fuel efficiency. It worked just like SOHC VTEC but with valve deactivation, the 16 valve 1.5 liter SOHC VTEC engine could be operated in 12-valve mode below 2,500 RPM. This engine was featured in the Honda Civic VX and had a fuel economy of 48 MPG City or 57 MPG Highway.

There's also a version of this engine known as the three-stage system. First is the 12-valve VTEC E for fuel efficiency, next is the regular 16-valve VTEC which comes on above 2,500 RPM. The final stage is the 16-valve VTEC above 5,200 RPM for performance.

i-VTEC: This stands for intelligent VTEC and is still being used in Honda vehicles today. It integrates the ECU into the valvetrain mechanism making the profile change smoother and more efficient. However, its application is a bit different depending on the engine. DOHC inline fours work with Variable Timing control (VTC) while SOHC V6 engines with Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) aka cylinder deactivation to improve fuel efficiency.

K-Series

Honda's K-series is a famous performance engine that made use of i-VTEC and is great for swaps and big power, it is referred to as the LS or 2JZ of Honda engines. It made use of VTC mainly for performance purposes in engines like the K20A2 and K20Z3 in the Acura RSX Type S and Honda Civic Si. VCM was also used in engines like the K20A3 and K24A4 in the Civic Si and Accord models from 2002-2007. Honda R series of engines also make use of i-VTEC.

VTEC TURBO: Honda finally introduced turbo technology to its VTEC engines in the 2016 Civic with a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-four making 174 horsepower. A more powerful version came in the 2017 Honda CR-V with 190 horsepower. The U.S. got its first turbo VTEC in 2017 with the Honda Civic Type R with 306 horsepower and is still being used in the latest Civic. This final iteration combines the best parts of VTEC engines into one package.

This Is Why VTEC Is So Good

Many companies have tried to make Variable Valve Timing technology over the years. Toyota had VVT, BMW had VANOS later known as Valvetronic, and Porsche had VarioCAM. Since Honda got VVT right, other companies have learned from them and built their own versions of this technology. Honda created Variable Valve Timing that could easily be used for high-performance applications as well as lower fuel consumption purposes. This dual personality makes VTEC engines perfect for any application.

Cars That Made Use Of VTEC Engines

Honda still uses VTEC in cars today and since everything is done seamlessly, the effects aren't felt as strongly as early cars. These are some of the most famous and powerful cars to use VTEC

New Delhi: A court here on Saturday extended the Enforcement Directorate custody of BRS leader K Kavitha, an accused in the Delhi excise policy money laundering case, till March 26. The ED has alleged that Kavitha, the daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was a key member of the 'South Group' that has been accused of paying the AAP kickbacks of Rs 100 crore in return for a big share of liquor licences in the national capital.

""In view of the fact that further custodial interrogation of the accused (Kavitha) has been sought for further sustained and detailed interrogation the ED custody of the accused is extended till March 26,"" Special Judge Kaveri Baweja said.

The judge directed the Investigating Officer (IO) ""to ensure that further interrogation and confrontation of accused is done without any delay"". The court also allowed Kavitha's application to meet her family members, including her husband, son, brother, sister and sister-in-law, and her personal assistant (PA) in the court.

It noted that Kavitha had also filed another application seeking directions to the ED to allow her home-cooked food to enable her to have the medically prescribed diet.

In her plea, Kavitha said that she was suffering from some medical ailments, such as heartburn and the doctor had advised her to conform to the specified diet.

""It is noted that in the order dated March 16 permission for providing a medically prescribed diet has already been issued. However, considering the request made on behalf of the accused today, she is permitted to be provided with home-cooked food, as requested,"" the court said.

In its plea seeking an extension of her custodial remand by five days, the federal probe agency said Kavitha was interrogated, confronted with statements of four people and questioned based on the findings during investigation.

It said Kavitha was also confronted with a forensic report showing formatting of her mobile phone data during the probe. Her cell phone data was being analysed, it said.

""During the search conducted at the premises of the arrestee (Kavitha) on March 15, a mobile device belonging to Meka Saran (her nephew) has been seized. He was called two times to appear before the investigation. However, he has failed to appear before the investigation,"" the plea said.

It said the investigation in the last week revealed that Saran was involved in the transfer or utilisation of the proceeds of crime.

""Since he is in possession of information relevant for investigation in the case and he is not cooperating with the investigation, Search is being conducted at his premises (in Hyderabad on Saturday),"" the plea said.

It said Saran is a ""close relative"" of the Kavitha and that he was present in her house when ED conducted the raid.

""Some of the family business details, financials of the family business etc. were sought and she (Kavitha) said that she would inform her counsel/family member and the same information will be shared by them through mail,"" the plea said. But not a single detail was furnished to the ED, it said.

""An application is also moved before this court for further interrogation of Sameer Mahendru, for getting the details of the said transfer/utilization of proceeds of crime (POC) by Meka Saran, and to ascertain the role of the arrestee,"" the remand application said.

It said Kavitha has to be interrogated on the recent findings.

During the proceedings, Kavitha's advocate Nitish Rana filed a bail plea following which the ED counsel said the Investigating Officer (IO) is ""neck deep"" in the case and the order on bail could be passed on the next date of hearing.

""Five days is enough for filing a reply to the bail. I am not pressing it,"" the advocate said.

Kavitha, 46, a Telangana Legislative Council member, was arrested by the central probe agency from her residence at Banjara Hills in Hyderabad on March 15.

This move is aimed at promoting trust, transparency, and collaborative development within the community.

Worldcoin Foundation makes its Orb technology open source

By making the code for its Orb eye scanners accessible to anyone, the platform intends to encourage further advancements in the technology. The open-sourcing initiative builds upon previous steps taken by Worldcoin, including the release of the iris code late last year and the opening up of hardware nearly a year ago.

This strategic approach not only fosters trust and verifiability but also invites developer communities to contribute to the ongoing evolution of the technology. Worldcoin, a separate crypto project from OpenAI, was launched in January 2023 under the name ""Tools for Humanity"" by Sam Altman and Alex Blania. Its primary objective is to establish a global identification standard that validates ""personhood"" to combat bot activity.

In July, the platform introduced its WLD token on the Optimism mainnet, marking a significant milestone in its development. The cornerstone of Worldcoin's technology is the Orb, which utilizes iris scans to create a unique ""fingerprint"" called the IrisCode. This data is then securely stored on Worldcoin's blockchain, forming the basis of a WorldID linked to each user.

Addressing controversies and partnerships

The project has faced scrutiny and controversy regarding its eye-scanning technology, particularly concerning user privacy and security. One of the concerns raised by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is the potential vulnerability if a malicious actor gains access to Orb manufacturing or hacking capabilities. This could lead to the generation of fake iris scan hashes and unauthorized creation of World IDs, posing a significant security risk.

Addressing these concerns, Worldcoin emphasizes that privacy and security have always been top priorities in developing the Orb. The foundation is actively conducting audits and has committed to maintaining a high level of transparency regarding privacy and security practices. Despite the challenges and controversies, Worldcoin has also forged partnerships and collaborations. In February, blockchain-based esports platform Community Gaming announced its integration of Worldcoin's WorldID to detect cheaters effectively.

It's worth noting that the Worldcoin Orb is not mandatory for Community Gaming's WorldID integration, providing users with flexibility in adopting the technology. Following the announcement of the open-sourcing initiative for its Orb technology, Worldcoin's WLD cryptocurrency experienced a notable price increase of nearly 4% to $8.40. However, the cryptocurrency market's overall volatility has led to fluctuations of up to 10% within the past 24 hours, reflecting broader market trends impacting digital asset prices.

Worldcoin Foundation's decision to open-source core components of its Orb technology marks a significant step towards enhancing trust, transparency, and collaborative development within the crypto community. While challenges persist, the foundation remains committed to addressing privacy and security concerns while pursuing partnerships to drive innovation in digital identity solutions.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Owotunse Adebayo,0.1843137254901961,448917295,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7423.jpeg,

Like when you buy a pair of scissors but can't get to them because they're trapped inside a hard plastic shell that requires scissors to open. Or the Apple mouse, with its port on the underside, rendering it unusable while charging.

These frustrations don't make a product bad, per se; they're just irksome. The kind of little frictions that make you think, Why'd they do that?

No standard spoon can fit inside the narrow openings of the typical glass caper jar. Dumping them out risks loss of essential brine. Even if you do have a supremely tiny utensil to fish them out, there's no single-dip solution: At best you can capture three or four in one go, and any piccata recipe or lox spread worth its salt calls for, like, at least a dozen capers. Why, dear God, why do they do that?

This is a story about one of modern life's least consequential but most acutely annoying experiences: getting a sufficient number of capers out of those dollhouse-size jars they're sold in.

The short, unsatisfying answer? Capers are expensive, so producers sell them in smaller jars to make each unit more affordable. But the reason for tall jars instead of squat ones is a longer story.

For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.

Straight off the vine, capers are terribly bitter. But someone, somewhere (likely hundreds of years ago), got it in their heads to take those practically inedible buds, dry them out in a boatload of sea salt and then rehydrate them.

Once they're cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It's not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.

A definitive explanation for the svelte glass jar that they come in is hard to come by. Major caper purveyors Cento and Goya did not respond to requests for comment.

Reddit threads on the subject tend to upvote the theory that the tall, skinny glass jars keep the capers fresh by ensuring they stay submerged in their brine.

Russell Zwanka, the director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, echoed that as a plausible theory.

""I do understand the frustration of a spoon not fitting, and I don't have an answer for that,"" Zwanka said. ""I don't know why you can't make it just another half an inch bigger.""

There is another, more profit-focused theory. It's courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).

Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.

After all, there's little practical value to the skinny jar. In fact, it's far less practical, from the producers' standpoint.

""The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package -- because they're tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they're harder to get into the jar,"" said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.

His take: ""It's primarily because some marketer feels that they're going to look more elegant on the shelf.""

Food packaging does a lot of different things, Zwanka says. It of course keeps food fresh, prevents waste and makes sure the product can be shipped efficiently.

""But we also want to make sure that products are affordable,"" he said.

Because capers are expensive -- and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta -- food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.

Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world's most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it's perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.

""You need the jar so it'll fit in the in the spice rack,"" he says. ""But you also couldn't fill that jar, or it would be $200.""

If you're only using a few capers a year, a tiny jar that can live unobtrusively in the fridge makes sense for most people. Prices vary, but a 3-ounce jar runs you about $4 at the grocery store.

Still, you might wonder: Why is it a that jar so tall and narrow you need a nail file to stab at the tiny green orbs?

Blame the success of Skinny Can Chic.

Strolling down the soda aisle lately, you'll notice that beverage cans have slimmed down, squeezing the same 12 ounces of fluid into a more slender package.

""Consumers see slim cans as more sophisticated, which makes them feel more sophisticated,"" Duane Stanford, the editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest, told CNN last year.

The same thing is happening in the beer aisle, Zwanka notes.

""They've all adapted what you would consider the Red Bull can, because Red Bull kind of started it. But now anybody who wants to signify that it is thinner, lighter, less calories, maybe healthier ... they put it thinner cans.""

Labor costs are the main reason capers cost more than you might expect from what is essentially a pickled weed. The vast majority of the capers at the grocery store are grown in the wild in places like Morocco, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and they are picked by hand.

""It takes you an hour to pick a kilo, if you're very fast,"" says Brian Noone, who runs a wholesale caper plant nursery in Adelaide, South Australia. ""The other problem is, people tend to think the smaller ones taste better...But it's a lot more work to get the smaller ones,"" which are called ""non-pareils.""

Once they get to your kitchen, there are a number of hacks for getting them out of the jar.

A Reddit page on the universally frustrating process is titled: ""getting capers out of those stupid f*cking narrow jars.""

Among the tips and tricks offered by Redditors:

Try a a long metal bar spoon or a half-teaspoon measuring spoon. Other common utensil suggestions: An old fashioned potato peeler, chef's tweezers, a tiny melon baller, a wide-mouth boba straw.

""I use a tiny fork. Like the kind for shrimp cocktail or crab,"" offers one user.

""Korean dessert fork for me! It's a tiny fork head on a long chopstick-shaped handle,"" says another.

But perhaps there's no solution quite as simple as going all in -- and dumping them all out.

As one Redditor said: ""I've never been in a situation where I don't decide to just use the entire tiny jar for what I'm making.""

""Don't wait.""

That's the message from Vantage West Project Sales representative Jeff Anderson, who has seen first-hand that the Central Okanagan is officially on the global stage when it comes to real estate. Anderson recently helped to sell The View at Big White, and all 60 units were sold in 55 days through a Toronto investment firm.

""Through the marketing, the advertising, I had a lot of people in the community of Kelowna letting me know that our pricing was too expensive. It was not feasible,"" Anderson says. ""I had real estate agents tell us the same and that we would never get the pricing that we thought we would get.""

The View at Big White, which is on some of the last land available in the heart of the village at the ski resort, stands out as a testament to the evolving market dynamics and the opportunities they present.

Anderson believes those who live in the Central Okanagan are not seeing the big picture, while those who do not live in the region but want to vacation in or relocate to it have 20/20 vision. Despite high interest rates, now is the time to get into the pre-sale market, because once those rates start to drop, developers are not going to be offering deals like they are currently.

""If you can find a pre-sale that's closing late 2025 and into 2026, you're really going to set yourself up for a great financial future, because you're able to buy at today's market price,"" Anderson says.

""Developers, when they know that the market is going to shift, that's when they start taking things away. Right or wrong, that is the reality.""

Anderson cautions the market is nearing a saturation point, with projects like Anacapri, Nolita and Savoy in Kelowna nearing full capacity. This tight inventory suggests a looming scarcity that potential buyers should not underestimate.

In addition, the cost of materials to build future projects is not about to go down anytime soon. Developers, after all, are in business to make money.

""But people have it in their head that these developers are going to pay more money for the product to build the product and then sell it for less,"" he says. ""How does that make sense?""

And as Anderson pointed out, the rest of the world has an eye on the Central Okanagan, most notably those from Europe and our neighbours from the East Coast.

""What people in the Kelowna market don't understand is we're no longer just a little town anymore,"" he says. ""We have an international airport, and we have direct flights coming from Toronto.""

In other words, if home ownership or investment is something you seek, now is the time to make a move.

""Can you afford -- for you and your family's future -- to miss the market again?"" Anderson says. ""We at Vantage West Project Sales are here to help and educate. I already bought my unit, so this is not a sales pitch. It's the reality of this ever changing landscape.

""So it comes down to just six little words to ask yourself. And when you put them together they send a very powerful message: Can I afford to be wrong?""

Picture: supplied.

One of the state's most striking homes at Glen Osmond is up for grabs after hitting the market following an extension.

Dimitri Aretzis bought the home at 73 Sunnyside Rd five years ago as a single-bedroom, single-bathroom and single-garage property.

He was attracted by its striking design, as well as the potential for an extension.

""It's a modern home, with a contemporary feel and I think it's just such a timeless design,"" Mr Aretzis says.

""I think it's going to look just as good in 20 years time.

""We've added a lower level, so there's a staircase that leads down from that original central garage and down there are two bedrooms - including the master with an ensuite - a family area, another bathroom and a deck, and we've also added a deck onto the top level.

""Plus we've also added a double garage, so it ticks all the boxes now in that it has space for a family and outdoor living.

""In saying that, from the street view, it hasn't changed the look of the house at all, you still see the columns that hold up the building and our extension is in between those columns.

""Architect Damian Campagnaro is really talented and did a great job of the original design, and I think that we've taken his concept forward and made it a really versatile property.""

The capsule-shaped upper level has an open-plan living and dining room at one end and a bathroom at the other, with both featuring striking curved walls.

In between them is a kitchen, a bedroom, a study and a rumpus room/garage/laundry.

Just as the original owner designed this space to showcase her vintage Porsche, Mr Aretzis says he has enjoyed using it to house a car he loves.

""I loved the idea and thought the concept was great - hence why there's a historic sports car in the garage now,"" he says.

Mr Aretzis says as amazing as the home is, its location is second to none.

""We're 10 minutes from the city, 20 minutes from the beach, and just a stone's throw from good schools, shopping and golf clubs, so it's a great location,"" he says.

""Plus the view is incredible.

""It overlooks the whole Adelaide plains and in the morning when you wake up you feel like you've woken up in the trees - you can see the weather rolling in and it's very peaceful.

""It would be perfect for a couple with teenage children, someone creative or someone looking for something low-maintenance.

""It's an amazing home.""

That's a lot less than the 2024 second-round pick than the Chiefs had been asking for in exchange for Sneed, continuing a trend that has extended throughout this offseason.

In fact, that third-rounder is among the highest compensation exchanged in a player-for-pick trade this offseason. All-Pro linebacker Brian Burns was traded for a second rounder, but every other player traded has done so for lackluster returns.

Carlton Davis and two other picks got the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a third. Morgan Moses and Keenan Allen went for a fourth. Sam Howell and a fourth returned a third -- the same for Kenny Pickett. Mac Jones netted a sixth. Joe Mixon was traded for seventh rounder.

It sure seems that for whatever reason, the players that teams want to trade are not being valued highly in the open market. That could be good news for the Steelers if they're serious about their pursuit of San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.

The 49ers reportedly asked the Jacksonville Jaguars for pick No. 17 and wide receiver Zay Jones for Aiyuk earlier this offseason, and the Jaguars declined. It seems clear now that the 49ers won't get that level of return for Aiyuk, but how low will the market (and GM Jed York) go?

The 49ers are not in a great salary cap situation, and it would be far better for them to extend Aiyuk's contract that pay him his one-year, $14.1 million fifth-year option. But they also don't have to trade him. They did this a few years ago, when Deebo Samuel requested a trade. They sought offers, didn't like what they saw, and then decided it was better to keep him.

So it's no guarantee that a soft market means the Steelers are in line to get a great deal, but it certainly won't hurt in their pursuit of the top receiver available on the market.",steelersnow.com,news,Steelers Now,Alan Saunders,0.05882352941176472,448916877,1,https://steelersnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2023/09/Sept-10-2023-Steelers-v-49ers-at-Acrisure-Stadium-Pittsburgh-PA-304.jpg,eng-9420057

OLED was then rolled out to the latest iPhones, and in the weeks that followed, the idea was rolled out to the new iPad Pro as well. The future Apple Watch Ultra was expected to be the first Apple Watch to use microLED in its display, a technology known for its vibrancy, brightness, and shine. Alas, it looks like it's off the menu again.

The next Apple Watch Ultra may have a bright microLED display. But now it looks like... [+] abandoned.

David Phelan

In early March, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple canceled the microLED Apple Watch project, but a conflicting report was released soon after, calling the claims completely nonsense and subject to intense scrutiny. He said he couldn't stand it.

Now, another industry analyst has his say. Bloomberg's Mark Garman claims there was a long project to design the company's smartwatch display, which was supposed to be the company's first in-house screen.

Garman described the project as another expensive research and development initiative that was scrapped in recent weeks, around the same time the rumored Apple Car was completed.

Apple has always preferred to manufacture as many components in-house as possible. This means you have more control over the process, rather than being at the mercy of another manufacturer. Of course, as we regularly emphasize, Apple does not use off-the-shelf components, but it has significantly optimized them. However, creating the entire component allows complete customization.

As Garman points out, the company had high hopes for microLEDs, which are made from millions of tiny light-emitting diodes, and wanted to play a key role in their development. This technology reduces power consumption, reproduces colors more accurately, and enables thinner devices.

He also claims that microLED will be more widely adopted in the same way that OLED screens have made their way from the Watch to the iPhone. Eventually, he expects microLEDs to be included in everything from the Apple Watch to the iPhone to the Mac.

The first sign of trouble appears to have come when manufacturing partners recruited to sort mass production tasks announced that they had lost contracts related to micro-LED projects, such as AMS-Osram AG.

So is this the end of the road for microLED at Apple? Not necessarily. There is already one product using this technology. The Apple Vision Pro's twin eyepieces are microLED displays. A new report claims that Apple is considering potential new suppliers and processes, but new products are likely years away.

Technical data suggests that a correction of between 10% to 20% could be on the cards for SOL. Investors anticipating a drop could seize a buying opportunity if the $134 level is retested.

ContentsDownward Trend Looms for Altcoin SOLKey Points to Watch for Solana Downward Trend Looms for Altcoin SOL

The altcoin SOL price, which has given back half of the gains recorded last week, traded below the $200 psychological level. This downward trend could lead to further corrections in the upcoming days. It seems like altcoin SOL needs to catch its breath.

The cryptocurrency Solana has seen a 1022% increase since September 2023. This remarkable rise is due to Bitcoin's bull run and the over-selling of SOL linked to the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. Last week, altcoin SOL recorded its highest weekly gain for the year 2024 with a 39% increase.

However, in the last five days, the price of altcoin SOL has experienced a significant drop around the $200 psychological level and is currently trading approximately 16% lower than the previous week's closing level.

Key Points to Watch for Solana

There are key points that could be decisive for investors. Stable support levels could enhance the appeal of Solana. A weekly support at $152 and the midpoint of the previous bear market at $134 are among these supports. However, even though accumulating at the $134 level may seem attractive, the likelihood of such a correction following excessive rises is low.

If Solana overcomes the $200 psychological level, the likelihood of the uptrend continuing increases, while downturns in Bitcoin, the flagship of cryptocurrencies, could trip up altcoin SOL. On the other hand, a decisive weekly candlestick closing below $134 could signal a potential change in trend. This situation could lead to panic selling by weak hands.

However, we must be prepared for the worst-case scenario. If panic selling drives SOL below $100, an 11% drop could initiate a journey towards the $89 support level. Investors should consider such scenarios when forming their strategies and managing their risks. As of writing this article, the price of the altcoin Solana (SOL) is trading at $175.

The Samastha Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Qutbah (SKJQ), a feeder organisation of Samastha Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Ulama, has asked all quatibs to spread awareness on water conservation during Friday prayers. The move gains importance in view of the water shortage currently plaguing Karnataka and sweltering summer heat back home in Kerala. ""Islam gives paramount importance to judicious use of water. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) had said water for wudu (ablution) should be used sparingly even if one is doing it in the flowing river,"" SKJQ general secretary Nazar Faizi Koodathayi told TNIE.

The organisation has urged believers to exercise care while performing ablution under a running tap, as it may lead to unnecessary wastage of water while moving from one organ to another. ""It is advisable to depend on ablution tanks for wudu when there is water shortage. After ablution, the water should be used for agriculture or other purposes,"" Faizi said. He said supplying drinking water is a pious deed that will be rewarded in heaven. ""A person had asked the Prophet (SAW) about how he could ensure heaven for his deceased mother. The Prophet (SAW) replied that he should distribute drinking water among people,"" he said.

He said creating awareness on saving water has become imperative in Kerala too even though it is available here in plenty, as changes in the climate are posing a danger to life. ""Decline in rainfall and depletion of groundwater are signs of an impending catastrophe,"" Faizi said. ""Around 40% of our water sources are polluted. People should be made aware of such things and should be exhorted to prevent a disaster,"" Faizi said.

Faizi believes future wars will be fought for water. ""Israel attacked Lebanon for the water in the Litani river. One of the reasons for the US aggression on Iraq was to get water from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers,"" he said. Faizi said the Quran had several verses that underlined the importance of water. ""Surah 23, verse 18 says, ""We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away."" Similarly, Surah 67, verse 29 says, ""Did you even consider: if all the water that you have (in the wells) were to sink down into the depths of the earth, who will produce for you clear, flowing water?"" he said.",greaterkashmir.com,news,Greater Kashmir,,0.2862745098039217,448916353,1,https://www.greaterkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tap_water.jpg,

The focus is mainly on the reuse of discharged wastewater from RO filter systems and sewage treatment plants (STP).

One of the methods which has proven effective for these societies is using the wastewater discharged from RO water filters in a centralised manner to reap greater benefits.

For instance, after the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) issued an order saying that drinking water should not be used for non-potable purposes, Aristocrat Apartments at Kasturinagar came up with a way to collect around 600 litres of RO wastewater every day.

""We first did a survey in the apartment and found that out of 145 units, we can get around 10 litres of RO wastewater every day from around 70 units. We gave them 10-litre cans to fill and keep outside their houses. This water will then be poured into two 200- litre drums which we have bought. By fitting taps and hose to those tanks, we can use that water for car washing, mopping of common areas, and for plants,"" said Rohini Ghose, secretary of the apartment association.

She added that as they are left with some spare water after utilisation, they have sent the samples to a NAPL-accredited laboratory to see if all the required parameters are met to use it for other purposes such as topping up swimming pools.

Apartments which had employed unique conservation methods even before the crisis struck are now sharing their ideas to help other societies conserve water.

Krishnanagar Apartments at Vimanapura has connected the RO waste discharge systems from all houses in a centralised manner to let the water into rainwater harvesting (RWH) pits.

""Per day, we can conserve up to 6,000 litres of water with this method at a mere material and labour cost of ₹3,000. While the treated water from the RWH pits can be used for non-potable purposes, as the RWH pits are close to our borewells, it can also help in recharging the groundwater which could be beneficial to everyone in the vicinity,"" said an ex-committee member from the society.

At Sobha Classic in HSR Layout too, the centralised RO system has reduced the wastage of water. ""Individually, for every eight litres of water that is filtered for drinking, 25 litres are wasted. But as we have this centralised system, the loss is only 25%,"" said Sreejith Govind, a member of the apartment's managing committee.

While most apartments use STP water for flushing, gardening, and cleaning purposes, some apartments have found a way to ensure the water that remains after their usage does not go to waste.

""After our usage, we used to pump around 50 KLD STP water into the drain. Hence, we tied up with a private company which converts STP water into potable water. Since many might not be comfortable with consuming such treated water, it can also be bought back by the apartment and used to fill swimming pools or for other such uses,"" said Jubin Thomson, secretary of the apartment welfare association.

Boasting the eighth overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, the Falcons are in a strong position to get one of the best prospects available. Plus, as mentioned, with their QB locked in for at least the next two seasons, there's no need to add another in the first round.

This means the Falcons can focus on taking another player that would better align with their needs. However, wouldn't it be better if the Falcons had even more freedom to take the best overall player available instead of selecting a specific position?

Last year the Falcons ranked near the bottom of the league (21st), averaging 2.5 sacks per game. They haven't added anyone to the front seven or anyone on defense that will fix their lack of a pass rush in 2024. Aside from changing head coaches, the Falcons, so far, are relying on improvement from within. But that may be a bad plan for a team with their eyes on the playoffs.

While the NFL Draft offers a great opportunity to land a future star, you can't count on a rookie to make an immediate impact. But turning to proven players? That's a different story.

According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, the Falcons could turn to the trade market to fill their need for another edge rusher instead, and they're already being linked to Philadelphia's Haason Reddick.

""The expectation leaguewide is that he (Haason Reddick) is moved at some point. The Eagles went and spent on Bryce Huff, they re-signed Josh Sweat, so they have their two pass rushers. Reddick appears to be the odd man out. He does want a new deal, but this is a premier guy that should have value. He wants a new contract, plus the draft capital that it's going to take to get him. Arizona could be a team to watch because Jonathan Gannon was with him two years ago in Philly. They had good production together. Arizona needs pass rushers. Atlanta to an extent, so there should be teams in the mix.""

Reddick is known to be on the trade block after the Eagles brought Brandon Graham back, paid Josh Sweat, and signed Bryce Huff to a $51 million contract. Despite coming off back-to-back Pro Bowl seasons, the 29-year-old isn't likely to command a top draft pick in return. A Day 2 selection should get it done.

While adding Reddick shouldn't prevent the Falcons from selecting another pass-rusher at No. 8 overall, his presence would reduce the need to draft one right away. This would allow more flexibility should they receive a strong offer to trade down from eight. Otherwise, pairing both the pass-rushers together would be a great way to ensure the front seven takes a major step forward in 2024.",sportsnaut.com,news,Sportsnaut.com,Andrew Buller-Russ,0.2470588235294118,448916329,1,https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atlanta-Falcons-22451379.jpg,

But what looked like a very good day for Red Bull was dampened slightly when third-place qualifier Sergio Perez received a three-place grid drop for impeding Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg.

With that in mind, here's how the revised Australian GP grid looks:

1 Max Verstappen (Red Bull)

2 Carlos Sainz (Ferrari)

3 Lando Norris (McLaren)

4 Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)

5 Oscar Piastri (McLaren)

6 Sergio Perez (Red Bull)

7 George Russell (Mercedes)

8 Yuki Tsunoda (RB)

9 Lance Stroll (Aston Martin)

10 Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin)

11 Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

12 Alex Albon (Williams)

13 Valtteri Bottas (Sauber)

14 Kevin Magnussen (Haas)

15 Esteban Ocon (Alpine)

16 Nico Hulkenberg (Haas)

17 Pierre Gasly (Alpine)

18 Daniel Ricciardo (RB)

19 Zhou Guanyu (Sauber)

Perez's penalty promotes Lando Norris to third on the starting grid, and the McLaren will be joined on the second row by the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc - who had topped the second and third practice sessions in Melbourne.

His is the second SF-24 in the order, as Carlos Sainz - on his return following his appendectomy on the Saudi Arabian GP weekend a fortnight ago - ran Verstappen closest in the final part of qualifying and will start second.

Oscar Piastri also moves up a spot to fifth at Perez's expense. He was underwhelmed by his result but fared considerably better than fellow home hero Daniel Ricciardo, who had his final Q1 lap deleted for exceeding track limits and was eliminated as a result.

But there was better news on the other side of the garage. Yuki Tsunoda's efforts to haul the RB into Q3 for a second race weekend in a row were rewarded with eighth on the grid as he outqualified the Aston Martins of Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso.

Tsunoda's lap to make Q3 played a role in Lewis Hamilton missing out on a spot. The seven-time F1 world champion will line up 11th, four places behind team-mate George Russell - who beat Hamilton to the final place in Q3.

Esteban Ocon hauled the beleaguered Alpine team into Q2 for the first time this season but 15th was the extent of his progress. He will share row eight with Hulkenberg, who was disgruntled to have been impeded by Perez but did not feel that was the sole reason for his Q1 exit as it occurred on his first run.

Zhou Guanyu - whose front wing broke during a Q1 lap - will start 19th for Sauber, which is the last spot on the grid for the Australian GP. That is because Williams elected to stand Logan Sargeant down and hand his car over to Alex Albon, whose accident in first practice on Friday ruled the team's only other chassis out of competition.",the-race.com,news,The Race,Race Team,0.2862745098039217,448916138,1,https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1200/2024/03/XPB_1268099_HiRes.jpg,eng-9419752
